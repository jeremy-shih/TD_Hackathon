My name is France, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PNC Financial Services Group Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bill Callihan. You may go ahead, sir.","William H. Callihan","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call is PNC's President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rick Johnson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Actual results and future events could differ possibly materially from those anticipated in our statements and from our historical performance due to a variety of risks and other factors. Our forward-looking statements regarding PNC's performance assume a continuation of the current economic environment and do not take into account the impact of potential legal and regulatory contingencies. Information about such factors, as well as GAAP reconciliations and other information on non-GAAP financial measures we discuss is included in today's conference call, earnings release, related presentation materials, and in our 10-K, 10-Q, and various other SEC filings and investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under the Investor Relations section. These statements speak only as of July 17, 2013, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Demchak.","William S. Demchak","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. I'm going to start by running through some of the highlights of our second quarter earnings and talking about the progress we are making on some of our strategic priorities. I will also share some views on the environment and how it's likely to affect us through the remainder of the year before I turn it over to Rick to run you through the actual results, and then we'll take your questions.","As you've all seen, we reported net income of $1.1 billion or $1.99 per diluted common share, with the return on average assets of 1.49%. Honestly, these are big numbers. And while we're pleased with the results, as we noted, we did have several select items in the quarter, and let me run through a couple of these.","First, we sold some Visa Class B common stock and we realized a gain of $83 million. As you all know, we've been monetizing our position in Visa over time and at the end of the second quarter, we still had approximately $750 million in unrealized gains. And we also sold some securities early in the quarter when rates were low, which gave rise to some security gains and increased our asset sensitivity. As rates rose later in the quarter, we reinvested those proceeds. Now the net effect was higher than normal security gains and lower than forecasted NII. All else equal, it should benefit NII in future quarters.","In addition, higher interest rates improved the valuations of our commercial mortgage servicing rights and our derivative counterparty book. Also you've seen our provision for loan losses declined this quarter and was substantially below, I tell you, our own expectations, as credit quality improves faster than our forecast, and this is particularly true on the commercial space.","Having said all of that, on the negative side, we did record increased residential mortgage repurchase provisions this quarter, primarily in response to additional information for Freddie Mac. Now this is an issue that everybody in the industry is working hard to bring to a close as quickly as possible, and that's certainly our goal as well.","Now apart from those select items, client fee income was really strong, and as you've seen, our capital ratios were strengthened. We hit our expense numbers in the second quarter and we remain focused on improving our efficiency ratio even as we make targeted investments through the remainder of the year to meet our clients' needs.","And as we look at where we are in relation to our long-term priorities, we're starting to see the tangible benefits of our long-term growth strategy, and the shift of our revenue mix towards fee income is becoming visible as a result of this. Last quarter, we talked about our efforts to cash in more of our clients' investable assets and are investing in retirement cross-sell effort continues to gain traction. AMG new primary client acquisitions, referral sales, brokerage fees were all up linked-quarter and year-over-year.","In the Residential Mortgage Banking business, volume trends were actually quite good in the second quarter, with loan originations of $4.7 billion, up 11% linked-quarter and 30% over the second quarter in '12, consistent with our strategic objectives. We've expanded our seamless delivery program across our entire network of mortgage originators and brought our average time to close for loans going through the new process down to 38 days in May. That's about 20 days better than our peer average of 58. And we believe we think we can do even better. And importantly, we're seeing -- we're already seeing customer satisfaction scores rise significantly from the past.","Now clearly, higher rates here are going to slow application volume and, in turn, decrease gain on sale margins. Notwithstanding this, it appears that our model of retail-only originations focus on purchase transactions, increased capacity and the rollout of seamless delivery have all combined to mitigate the potential decline relative to our peers.","In the Retail Bank, we've had lot of activity inside of our delivery channels as we work to build the bank of the future. We consolidated 78 branches this quarter on top of the 30 we consolidated in the first quarter, and we're still targeting a total of about 200 for the year. You will see and we also announced that we're phasing out traditional free checking. And despite this activity, attrition of our existing customers has been less than expected. We actually added 55,000 new DDA households and grew in average loans by about $300 million in the second quarter.","In C&IB, as we've been expecting for some time, the market has become more competitive, and it's more difficult to win new primary clients and grow loans while maintaining our risk and return thresholds. So while we continue to prospect for high-quality new clients and grow loans and we did add more than 200 clients in the second quarter in the corporate bank, our focus is shifting towards developing deeper and more valuable relationships with many of the 3,000-plus new clients that we added over the last few years.","We continue to make good progress in growing our share in the new Southeast markets, as well as the under-penetrated legacy markets like Chicago. As we look at what the Southeast is contributing in terms of new clients and the positive effect of our Southeast operations on fee income, we can start to see the benefits of the RBC Bank acquisition coming into focus.","In the second quarter in the Southeast, we added 11,000 DDA households in Retail, 95 new primary clients in Wealth and we've also seen a dramatic increase in new client wins in Corporate Banking in the Southeast. Year-to-date, over 20% of our new primary client wins in the Corporate Bank are coming from the Southeast markets.","Now much like our ongoing efforts to bring our Midwest markets in line with the performance of legacy PNC markets, our play in the Southeast is part of a long-term strategy that's going to take time and patience. But the market's receptivity to PNC continues to be enthusiastic, and we're quite encouraged from it.","We talked in the past about how we're positioned to grow relative to some other institutions because we've a lot of leverage to pull depending on market conditions, and this quarter is an example of our ability to make money even as the environment changes. It was an excellent -- we think it was an excellent quarter even without counting some of the select items. And while we're optimistic about the opportunities in the remainder of the year, and Rich's going to buy to an update on some of the guidance in a second, clearly, this remains a challenging and competitive environment. And that's probably a good place for me to turn it over to Rick to go through the quarterly results.","Richard J. Johnson","Well, thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin with our balance sheet on Slide 4. Total assets increased by $3.6 billion on a linked-quarter basis, as the growth in commercial and consumer lending was partially offset by a reduction in investment securities. Investment securities were down $1.9 billion or 3% compared to the first quarter, as we replaced a portion of the prepayments, maturities and sales activities during the quarter with forward-settling positions. I'll talk more about this later.","We saw a continued loan growth in the second quarter. Total loans increased by $3.3 billion or 1.8% on a spot basis compared to the first quarter. Commercial loan growth was the primary driver of our increase in loans. Total commercial lending increased by $3 billion compared to the first quarter of 2013, as a result of increases in asset-based lending, health care, real estate and public finance. Consumer lending saw a modest increase of approximately $300 million on a linked-quarter basis, primarily due to home equity loans and automobile lending, partially offset by paydowns in education lending and residential real estate.","Shareholders' equity increased by $600 million or almost 2% in the second quarter, primarily due to the growth in retained earnings, partially offset by a decline in AOCI. As a result, we ended the second quarter with strong capital ratios. Our Basel I Tier 1 common ratio at the end of the second quarter is estimated to be 10.1%, that's up 30 basis points since the end of the first quarter. Our Basel III Tier 1 pro forma common capital ratio was estimated to be 8.2% as of June 30, 2013, without the benefit of phase-ins, a 20 basis point increase from March 31. We achieved this improvement despite a $500 million after-tax decrease in security valuations, as interest rates increased and spreads widened. The growth in retained earnings and a modest decrease in risk-weighted assets exceeded the impact of the security valuation decline.","Although we now have final Basel III rules, we have not completed our review and continue to use the proposals for our estimated Basel III common capital. However, we are confident that the changes in the final rules from the proposals will not be negative to our common capital ratio. We continue to believe we will be well positioned to return additional capital to shareholders in 2014.","Turning to our second quarter income statement on Slide 5. Our net income for the second quarter was $1.1 billion or $1.99 per diluted common share. Our return on average assets for the second quarter was 1.49%, an increase of 15 basis points compared to the first quarter, a strong performance. We produced $4.1 billion in revenue, up 3% compared to the first quarter and 12% compared to the same quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by strong noninterest income performance, which increased $240 million or 15% on a linked-quarter basis.","While customer fee income was strong, this quarter also included higher gains on asset sales and valuations. I'll get more information on these gains in a moment, but you can see the details of these items on Page 16 in the consolidated financial highlights. Those increases were partially offset by a decline of $131 million or 5% in our net interest income when compared to the first quarter, which was the result of lower core net interest income and lower purchase accounting accretion. This decline is more than we expected, and I'll provide more details shortly.","Second quarter expenses of $2.4 billion were in line with expectations. As a result, our pretax pre-provision earnings were $1.6 billion, an increase of 4% compared to the first quarter and an increase of 67% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Provision in the second quarter was $157 million, lower than the guidance we've provided due to better than expected improvement in commercial credit quality.","Looking to the third quarter, we expect that the provision to be between $170 million and $250 million, as we expect the impact of improvements in commercial credit quality to ease, and we expect an overall increase in credit exposure.","Now let's review the components of net income in more detail. As you can see on Slide 6, our total net interest income declined by $131 million or 5% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily due to a 4% decline in core net interest income. Approximately $50 million of the decline in net interest income was from securities due to unexpected decline in security yields, and in part, to the portfolio management activities mentioned previously.","We sold approximately $2 billion of securities in the quarter when long-term rates were lower contributing to security gains of $61 million for the quarter. We also had approximately $3 billion of security portfolio run-off throughout the quarter due to prepayments and maturities. We did put some of that money to work later in the quarter when interest rates were higher and spreads were wider by purchasing securities for delivery in the third and fourth quarters. While decreasing net interest income in the second quarter, these activities should benefit net interest income in the future. As a result, we expect net interest income from securities to improve in the third quarter versus second quarter.","The remaining decline of $80 million resulted from a decline in net interest income from loans of $75 million. The $75 million decline included a $20 million decline on maturing swaps related to loans; a larger than expected decrease in purchase accounting accretion of $45 million primarily due to lower cash recoveries on commercial impaired loans; and a $10 million decline as loan yields were partially offset by higher loan balances.","While we do expect further pressure on loan yields, we do not expect the decline in net interest income from swap maturities and purchase accounting accretion to continue at these levels. Keep in mind that cash recoveries on partial impaired loans was only $10 million in the second quarter. It can't get much lower.","Looking to the third quarter, we expect net interest income to be modestly down, as the continuing impact of lower loan yields and a decline in scheduled purchase accounting accretion should be partially offset by loan and securities growth, including the portfolio management activities we took in the second quarter.","For the full year, we now expect purchase accounting accretion to decline by approximately $350 million versus 2012. And in 2014, we expect purchase accounting accretion to be down approximately $250 million compared to 2013.","As you can see on Slide 7, total noninterest income increased by $240 million or 15% in the second quarter compared to first quarter results. Bill spoke to you about the progress we're making on our strategic priorities. Further evidence of that can be seen in the growth we saw during the second quarter in our customer facing fee categories.","Asset management fees increased by $32 million or 10% on a linked-quarter basis. Consumer service fees were up $18 million or 6% compared to the first quarter, primarily as a result of higher debit card, merchant services, brokerage and credit card revenue. Corporate services increased by $49 million or 18% linked-quarter, which was primarily due to a $33 million increase in valuation gains from the impact of rising interest rates on commercial mortgage servicing rights valuations and a higher capital mortgage revenue.","Residential mortgage had strong loan sales revenues, originations were up 11% on a linked-quarter basis and the gain on sale margin of approximately 4% was flat compared to the first quarter. This resulted in 10% increase in loan sales revenue to $190 million. However, total residential mortgage fees were lower than first quarter, primarily due to an increase in repurchase demands as Freddie Mac requested additional files on older vintage loans, primarily 2004 and 2005, as National City was the large originator with Freddie Mac during that period. As a result, we recorded a provision of $73 million for residential mortgage repurchase obligations. This provision covers new originations in the second quarter and the additional demand for loan files. Finally, deposit service charges increased by $11 million or 8% linked-quarter.","We also sold 2 million of our Visa Class B common shares in the second quarter, resulting in a pretax gain of $83 million. We continue to hold approximately 12.4 million shares of Visa Class B common stock, with an estimated fair value of $950 million as of June 30, 2013. These shares are recorded on our books at approximately $200 million, resulting in an unrecognized value of approximately $750 million pretax. And as I mentioned earlier, the security sales resulted in a net gain of $61 million.","In addition, we saw an increase in revenue of $37 million, associated with the impact of higher market interest rates on valuations related to customer-initiated hedging activities. Effectively, the higher interest rates reduced the fair value of our credit exposure on these activities.","Our diversified businesses resulted in noninterest income to total revenue, increasing to 44% in the second quarter. That compares to 40% on the first quarter and 30% during the second quarter of last year. We continue to expect that full year total reported revenue will increase in 2013 compared to 2012.","Now turning to Slide 8. Second quarter total expenses increased by $40 million or 2% as we expected. This is primarily due to a $30 million noncash charge on the redemption of trust preferred securities, along with a $22 million increase in marketing expenses.","As you recall, our goal is to achieve a total of $700 million in continuous improvement cost savings this year. A significant portion of these dollars are being used to offset investments we're making in our businesses and infrastructure. Through the first half of the year, we have captured approximately $600 million of annualized savings. This gives us confidence that we will exceed our full year cost savings target. For the third quarter, we currently expect noninterest expenses to be up modestly compared to the second quarter, and we expect full year 2013 expenses on a reported basis to below 2012 by at least 5%.","Our credit quality continued to improve in the second quarter, as you can see on Slide 9. In the second quarter, accruing loans past due, nonperforming loans and charge-offs were all lower compared to the first quarter. Net charge-offs were $208 million, a decrease of $248 million or 54%, reflecting in part the $140 million impact of the first quarter alignment with regulatory guidance related to consumer lending. We also saw commercial net charge-offs declined by $91 million to $30 million during the second quarter, although this level of commercial net charge-offs may not be sustainable.","As you can see on the chart, we released $57 million of reserves from our commercial book during the second quarter, primarily due to improved credit quality. And we continued to maintain our reserves for consumer lending, as we monitor our performance on refinancing interest-only home equity loan maturities. As a result, our provision of $157 million declined by 33% on a linked-quarter basis. This reduced level of provisioning may not be sustainable.","Overall, PNC posted strong financial results in the second quarter due in part to certain select items that may not continue at these levels. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we do expect modest growth in loans and solid growth in fee income as defined on Slide 7. We also expect net interest income to be down modestly and noninterest expense to be up modestly when compared to the second quarter. And we expect the provision for credit losses to be between $170 million and $250 million, as we expect the pace of commercial credit improvement to ease and net credit exposure to increase.","And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Bill, can you give us more color on the competition on the commercial loan side? Your yields you show in your second quarter report here, declined fairly meaningfully to 3.71% from 4.03% in the prior quarter. Is it the Southeast, or the Midwest? Where is the real competition?","William S. Demchak","Well, first off, inside of that decline, a chunk of that, Rick knows the number, came from swaps that matured that were -- they're effectively A&L management long positions that we used to manage deposits, but we point them to loans. And as they roll off, the reported yield on loans drop. So the actual spread on the loans that we have on the book declined this quarter versus prior quarters. There's no increase or change really in the trend. On the demand side, the fight for small business, commercial, middle-market, generic product is pretty fierce, and we haven't seen much growth in that product, either outright new balances are changing the utilization. Where we continue to see progress is in our asset-based lending, in our real estate, in some of our verticals, health care and public finance and in specialty lending segments where we just -- frankly, we run into a lot less competition. The smaller banks aren't playing in that space.","Richard J. Johnson","Yes. I think, Gerard, if I could help a little bit there. You also had in that total loan yield balance, you had about a $40 million decrease in purchase accounting accretion related to cash recoveries, which is about 9 bps of the decline, as well as to Bill's point, the decline related to the swap maturities.","William S. Demchak","I wouldn't read anything into the trend line here.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Are there any swaps coming off in the second half of this year that could affect the yield?","Richard J. Johnson","There are, but they're not as material as what you saw in the second quarter.","William S. Demchak","Yes. I mean, remember, part of the noise you're seeing inside the yields, inside the NIM and inside the net interest income was a conscious decision as we basically -- when rates going back to April, were down at $165 million in the 10-year. We just let stuff roll off. We weren't replacing anything, and then we accelerated it through sales. So in effect, we took a lot of chips off the table, didn't replace and then replaced towards the end of the quarter. It wreaks havoc on our reported NIM and net interest income this quarter, but we think it was the right economic thing to do for the long term.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you also share with us, with the final NPR out on the Federal Reserve's interpretation of Basel, banks under a $700 billion in size will be able to choose if they want to keep the gains or losses in the securities portfolio in regulatory capital? Have you guys figured out which way you're going to go on that yet?","William S. Demchak","I think the rule is that, if you're a mandatory [indiscernible]B2 bank, that you don't have a choice, and you have to [ph] kind of AOCI, yes, so we're in.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You're in? Okay. And then finally, in terms of the outlook for the Tier 1 common ratio, assuming you get to your targets, do you think next year that we should expect a meaningful amount of shareholder -- capital return to shareholders?","William S. Demchak","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Rick, I was hoping you could maybe speak a little to sort of the core NII number? And I think to sort of over-simplify it, I mean, you guys are giving a lot of good color on what happened this quarter, and I guess it boils down to as much a timing issue as anything else between the securities gains and then the reinvestment. But if you guys have a little more pressure in the third quarter, are we getting to a point where that core NII number kind of settles out and maybe call it the $2 billion-ish a quarter range? And what are the major kind of puts and takes that you see going forward that would impact that number?","Richard J. Johnson","Well, you're going to continue to see pressure on loan yields. I mean, we would expect that to come down, but I think the balances we'll add in lending will offset that in terms of what the impact would be on core net interest income. We've already spoken briefly about the securities portfolio where you will see a decline in yield there as well. But again, the reinvestments Bill mentioned in the third and fourth quarter should help us to be able to maintain that balance and grow net interest income. The pressure is going to be on the scheduled accretion on purchase accounting where you would expect that to continue to come quarter-over-quarter.","William S. Demchak","Yes. I mean, one thing I'd point out, with all the press on higher rates and how this helps in the future, we're rolling off securities with average yields. I don't know, they're at 3.25 or something, and we're replacing them at 2.75. So all else equal, what we've stayed equally invested, you'd still continue to see a decline. Having said that, we've been massively under-invested and increasing that short position through the front end of this year as rates got lower and lower. So our ability to increase invested balances is -- even at somewhat lower rates on our average is going to increase the amount of revenue we get from it. And we're -- we can argue about the levels, but one thing is certain, we're closer to fair value on fixed rate returns today than we were in April.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, I appreciate that color then. And then, Rick, just want to make sure that I understand the guidance clearly. Just on the fee income side where you're expecting solid growth in the third quarter, that's off the sort of an adjusted number where you would remove some of the sort of unusual items that you guys have called out? Is that correct?","Richard J. Johnson","Yes. Scott, if you go to Schedule 7 of the report there, I don't know, Bill, you got the actual number there, it's all for that fee income number you see there, which is -- how much?","William S. Demchak","It's $1,294,000,000, Scott. You see we kind of drew a total of fee income. You take out the security gains, and that's where -- that's what we're talking about.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Perfect, okay.","Richard J. Johnson","And what we're -- where we're looking at, we're not expecting to repurchase reserve to repeat. And also in that, you have on the commercial side, the valuation on the CMSRs. We're not expecting that to repeat either at debt level but will grow off of those numbers, yes.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Paul Miller with FBR.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just a follow-up. On the valuation to CMSR number, can you remind us again where did that flowed through to and what that number was?","Richard J. Johnson","Yes. The actual number was 30 -- it was actually $45 million CMSR in the quarter. It was actually $11 million in the first quarter, so that's your increase of about $34 million. And that flows through your corporate service line, corporate service fee income.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Was there any one time items in the asset management? Was that just lumpiness that comes from the BlackRock investment?","Richard J. Johnson","Yes, and I think we just have to wait for BlackRock to release tomorrow.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then, consumer services was also strong. Was there any onetime items in there, or was that just strong second quarter performance?","Richard J. Johnson","No, that's just adding customers and focused on the brokerage business. The retirement investment business getting that to be more of an annuity product going forward. No, that's just good growth.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And is that a seasonal number, or is that just growth because you're increasing your customer base?","Richard J. Johnson","It's clearly seasonal off the first quarter. But you can see we've got strong growth year-over-year as well.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Yes. And is the growth coming from the RBC and acquisition to Southeast [ph]? I mean, can you follow up a little bit, add some colors to that?","Richard J. Johnson","I would suggest that's in there, clearly, but it's not driving the number yet.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Not driving the number? And on the mortgage side, can you talk a little bit about where do you see the gain on sale in the third quarter? Or is it too early to tell? We've seen rates go up. It looks like switching to more of a purchased market to a refi market, and how you fit into that?","William S. Demchak","Yes. Well, it's -- look, like everybody else, we expect that to decline as volumes decline and capacity and volume start matching. Now one thing that benefits us, and you see it in our printed numbers versus peers going back through time, is the fact that we're kind of retail-only not through corresponded channels. So that will help us. And we have been focused on purchase and have grown purchase, my guess would be at a pretty good clip relative to peers and it's the total percentage of the origination. So that'll help. But it's going to decline as total assets decline. We'll wait and see how much that is. But we feel pretty good on a relative basis as to where the company is positioned. They've done a good job reconfiguring the old National City Mortgage.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And have you been able to put lenders down south? I mean, one of the discussions about RBC didn't have a lot of product offerings. Are you able to get stuff down there, too?","William S. Demchak","Yes, we have full product and client teams in all the markets down there, and have had sort of 6 months after we closed the thing, we're basically up and running. And we've been, as you heard in my comments, we've been growing clients across all lines of business, including Wealth where they had literally nothing. They didn't have a single employee. But the reception on the Corporate side, Wealth and Retail were growing clients is pretty good. And by and large, we find those markets, particularly on the Retail side, to be less competitive than some of our other markets. And on the commercial and corporate side, no more than competitive than the other markets.","Operator","Next question, from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Rick, can you give us some more color on why the provision came in better than expected this quarter, and why you see it going up a little bit next quarter?","Richard J. Johnson","Yes. We just -- during the quarter, we didn't quite see as much growth as we're expecting in the loan book. We did have good growth, but it wasn't as much as we are hoping for. And then, I think, if you take a look at the charge-offs line as it relates to the commercial book, they were extremely low in the quarter. And so therefore, the pace of the improvement and credit quality in the commercial bank is much more than we have anticipated. Now going forward, we just think that, that pace of growth is going to ease a bit from where it is today, and we think we're going to continue to add credit exposure, net credit exposure to the portfolio overall. As a result, we've hedged our guidance back to the $170 million to $250 million range.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So the form it would take would be just smaller reserve release with charge-offs probably still improving?","William S. Demchak","Well, the charge-offs on the commercial side were particularly low. That's kind of our issue. We don't operate the business. We don't think of the business running at those levels in the near term. It's great that they do, and we hope they continue. But it's not really indicative of what we would say that's on our book.","Richard J. Johnson","So I would expect to see additional commercial reserve release, but I would not expect any on the consumer side.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Got it, okay. And on the put-back provision, have both Fannie and Freddie now look back to the early 2000s for you guys? So just trying to gauge any room for additional surprises here or changes in their behavior.","Richard J. Johnson","Well, they did approach us in November and they asked for about 8,000 files. They came back in May and asked for something like 10,000 files. So they had actually upped their interest in the files related to the old Nat City originations. We hope they're done.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then one bigger picture question. Return on assets, $149 million this quarter. I mean, close to your target. Just kind of think about how does that improve over time? And what's your longer-term target of where you'd like to see ROA headed?","Richard J. Johnson","Well, John, I think in the past, we've said we wouldn't hit 1.5% without some help from rising rates. And we got it this quarter but in a different kind of way, the impact on some of the asset yields and so on. I still think we still need to have a higher rate environment to exceed 1.5% over time.","Operator","Next question from the line of Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions. First is a follow-up on Mortgage. I think, Rick, you mentioned in terms of like the MSR or the servicing rather in R&W not to continue. But I guess the kind of a broader question is, the company was fairly positive in terms of the outlook for mortgage coming into the beginning of the year. It fell short a little bit in Q1. Obviously, Q2 was kind of not what was expected. But given the commentary we've heard from some of your peers, I'm just trying to gain a sense or reconcile between the increased capacity, perhaps more capacity on the HARP side, kind of -- if you can get a better read in terms of the back half of the year, all else being equal, kind of where you see this trending, particularly like the servicing, for example, has been trending lower at a clip much faster, so to speak, relative to expectations at this point in the cycle?","Richard J. Johnson","Well, actually, let me point out in Q2, actually, we're quite pleased. We had $4.7 billion in originations. Margin stayed flat at about 4%, 10% increase in origination revenue, we are pleased with that. But you're right, we do expect those volumes to fall off in the second half of the year, and the margins to go with it, as Bill mentioned a minute ago. I don't know, Bill, if you have further to add to that.","William S. Demchak","No, I think that it's hard to argue that applications for the industry aren't going to fall with higher rates, so that's going to happen. We feel pretty good about our position in inside of that decline in apps. But we, like everyone else, we're -- as we go through this, we're also going to have make our engine a little more efficient and take capacity out on the cost side, and I think you'll start seeing people start to talk about that.","Richard J. Johnson","And while refinance is going down, our percentage of purchase mortgage this quarter was 28%, which was pretty high relative to others.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And where did you -- I would just say, where did you end the quarter in terms of the forward pipeline relative to March?","William S. Demchak","I don't have that number in front of me.","Richard J. Johnson","No, it's obviously a little softer.","William S. Demchak","Yes. But it's -- I mean, I would tell you, it's not lower by the same big percentage as I've heard bandied about.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just finally, perhaps, Bill, a little bit more. On the debt side, borrowing cost perhaps didn't come down as much as expected, some of that timing. I know that you've talked about in the past in terms of leverage on your wholesale borrowings, if you will. And just curious kind of, as you look out the back half of the year, how rates of on the long end have moved as they have in terms of order of magnitude, what kind of leverage can we really expect in the back half of the year? As you noted, some of the debt was replaced here in the first half, and how do we -- how should we think about that in the back half of the year and the leverage on the borrowings?","William S. Demchak","I don't know -- I'm not sure I quite follow the leverage on the borrowings comment, but just on the...","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I'm thinking about the spread and just in terms of leverage on your borrowing cost at this point.","William S. Demchak","Yes. Well, I mean, a couple of things. The majority -- the vast majority of the investment that we did in the back, clearly, couple of weeks of the second quarter were forward settling, so you're going to see stuff show up later in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter, where you'll start seeing the improvement in income from the balances. The simple math is we're rolling off balances as they mature at 3-plus percent in yields and replacing them at 2.75%. But we're very under-invested relative to what we should be in terms of the value of deposits we hold. So we have a lot of room to put money to work at more rational rates. And rates today, they're rallying a bit today, but rates today are still almost 100 higher in the 10-year than they were in the tights [ph] at the beginning of the second quarter.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","No, I understand. I guess part of the question was really the fact that you did issue some debt here in the first half of the year, but I guess I'm more sensitive to with the scheduled maturities in the back half and certain opportunities you may have otherwise, would we expect some of that to just roll off without being replaced?","William S. Demchak","Sorry, just dropping our cost to funding on wholesale borrowings? Is that where you're going?","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes. Again, I mean, there is scheduled maturities and other opportunities within the debt, but...","William S. Demchak","Yes. Look, I think, by and large, and Rick can comment on it, that we've kind of played out the ability to drop our cost of funding. You will see us change our mix of funding perhaps as we look at bank notes and other things that we want to do as we get ready for LCR, but I don't think you're going to see a big change in the cost of funding. For us, it's really an issue of what's going on in the asset side, how we choose to invest in fixed rates through the rate cycle and our ability to grow loans at a decent risk-adjusted return, albeit, while credit spreads in general continue to decline. I mean, that's the game we and every other bank in the country are playing right now.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question, from the line of Moshe Orenbuch from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just really following up on that last one. I mean, most other banks have kind of sounded a little more hesitant to invest their liquidity at this point in the cycle than you, and maybe I'm reading in too much, so correct me if that's not right, but can you talk a little bit about your thought process there?","William S. Demchak","Yes, sure. Look, we're not at all thinking we're going long in this market, but we had literally gotten to the point where we were running everything off and not replacing anything off of what was already a very short position. So simple prudence, given the backup in rates at least has us replacing run-off, particularly run-off and then sales that occurred in the second quarter. So it's not as if we're going to go out and think, this is the panacea of we're buying the market here. But it is enough of fair value or higher than simple prudence suggests that we ought to replace some, and that's what you'll see us doing.","Richard J. Johnson","Our duration of equity is still negative what, 3, 3.5 years, something like that. That's still pretty sure.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Perfect. And separately, just on the mortgage gain on sale, I mean, I know that you kind of didn't want to talk about where it's running in the third quarter. But any thoughts about where it ended the quarter versus the average? Just any kind of look into that?","Richard J. Johnson","No. Towards the end of the quarter, it was probably closer to 3.5% as opposed to 4%. But -- so it was coming down in terms of the overall margin.","Operator","Next question, from the line of Erika Penala from Bank of America.","Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question is a follow-up on your expense guidance. Rick, you said full year expenses in 2013, lower by 5% year-over-year. Is that a core number, excluding some of the TruPS redemption, charges and merger charges, or is that off of the reported number?","Richard J. Johnson","That is a reported number. And as you know, the TruPS and integration and all that will be effectively 5%. And we're going to beat that, so we're going to be below $10 billion.","Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And just one more question on the margin. Relative to your core loan yield, this 3.77. As you look at your production pipeline, where -- what's your replacement yield on the loan book?","Richard J. Johnson","It really depends on the business. I mean, asset-based lending is still getting good returns, commercial real estate still getting good yields. If we're adding it to our conduit, which is basically the securitization activities, that's very high quality paper. But you're probably only seeing under 50 basis points or even less. So it really depends on the mix of the book.","William S. Demchak","Right. I guess what we see and we hear from the businesses is the trend line in credit spread decline hasn't really changed, right? They've been kind of grinding in a couple of handful of basis points a quarter, and that continues. And notwithstanding the noise that you see in the reported numbers in the second quarter, the trend didn't really change in terms of what we're originating in credit spread. It's just...","Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And just one more strategic one, Bill, if I can. Clearly, there is a lot of news out there about a large European bank looking to sell a large bank in your neighborhood. And I guess I'm wondering given your emphatic response earlier on the call about increasing capital return next year, is -- looking at this deal, a total nonstarter for you, or would you potentially think about maybe liquidating your BlackRock state and consider doing something like this in your backyard, given the implication for cost savings?","William S. Demchak","No.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just one more follow-up on the fee side and the outlook. There's a lot of moving parts, and I know you put this below the line type of stuff in there, but still a little bit confused on what you're actually saying about what fee base you grow off of? Is it just that $1,294 million piece that grows, or because if the other -- I guess the question is, what happens with the other line that you put below the line?","Richard J. Johnson","Yes. Ken, if you go to page -- Slide 7 of our presentation, we have fee income of $1,294,000,000. That's up from $1,251,000,000 in the first quarter. We're basically saying that we will grow fee income solidly from the $1,294,000,000.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then can you just give us a little context then of what's the driver underneath the other and why that wouldn't grow?","Richard J. Johnson","Well, I don't think unless the opportunities present themselves, I'm going to have a lot of net gains on securities given where rates have moved to. Potentially, as we consider monetizing Visa, we could have further gains there over time, but that's hard to predict. And then within the $372 million, you have about $35 million due to rates going up on our client hedging activities and the credit exposure related to that to CVA. I'm not expecting that to repeat, so I think that number will be lower. But if you take that other category, particularly, we say that's about $250 million to $300 million is what you can expect out of us. Maybe, maybe a little higher than that now, maybe we should be pushing that up to $275 million to $300 million in the quarter given the growth in the company.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. The other question I have is just a follow-on. BlackRock, last quarter, in ancient [ph] quarter, there was a lot of back-and-forth just in the market, and I just want to give you guys the opportunity again just to level set everybody on just your thoughts around where you stand there? And then what half would eventually need to be taken for you guys to even get to a point where you'd consider some optionality -- exercising some optionality on the BlackRock stake?","William S. Demchak","We've said the same thing for a long period of time. BlackRock has been a phenomenal partner and investment for our company. I wish we had this issue 5 times -- 5 times over inside of the things we own. Having said that, we recognized that through time, BlackRock has become more of an investment than a partnership. We recognized that we have a large position that we need to be cognizant of because it takes up a big chunk of our capital on our balance sheet. We currently like the returns that we get from it. We know that because of the low tax base in that ownership, that an outright sale of that entity is not friendly for shareholders. So the best thing I could say to you is that you should think of us as rational stewards of your capital. We look at that position and think of ways to optimize it. There is nothing currently on the table that we're contemplating that would do better for you than simply owning it today, and that's where we are. But we look at it all the time as you would expect us to in any position we would hold that would be that large.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Jack Micenko with SIG.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Most questions have been asked and answered, but I wanted to just go to the expense commentary. On track to exceed, continuous improvement in the slide deck, and then commentary said about $600 million annualized. Does exceed mean dollars, meaning there's more than $100 million more to go of opportunity? Or does exceed mean timing in terms of just realizing it sooner? And then remind us, I believe most of the RBC expenses were more front-end weighted there, but is there anything incremental on the RBC side still to go on the expense side?","Richard J. Johnson","No, the RBC was already baked into our investments for the year. Just -- you had $150 million in 2013, which is the full year running rate of what we invested in 2012. But we do plan to exceed the $700 million. We haven't quantified by how much. And I think that will contribute to the fact that we are going to exceed a 5% decline in year-over-year reported expenses.","William S. Demchak","I mean, I would tell you that, Rick continues to hedge this expense guidance a little bit. It's getting a little more bullish than, I mean, originally I think we said we'd be flat core, and now we're seeing we're flat to down and we'll be a little more than 5%. But the practical truth is, the company has really gotten behind the notion that we need to drive a more efficient organization, and we continue to be positively surprised by what we're seeing on the day-to-day roll up of numbers, whether it's headcount or outright expenses. So our guidance is what our guidance is. But I like what I am seeing, I like the work the company is doing, I like the fact that the employees have kind of gotten a bit between their teeth and are taking it seriously, and we're encouraged by it.","Richard J. Johnson","Yes.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. So moving forward, is it CIP 2.0, or is it just expense guidance is down x percent or whatever from here?","William S. Demchak","Well, what did you say to him? Are we -- we're going to be down by more -- what was your -- down by...","Richard J. Johnson","Our reported expenses will be down year-over-year by more than 5%.","William S. Demchak","Okay. And every nickel we can find beyond that, we'll find.","Richard J. Johnson","Right. Exactly.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just coming back to the size of securities book and just the capacity that you have to add over time. And I realize that you wouldn't do this, this quarter or next quarter, but just conceptually, if you wanted to get back from this negative 3-year duration of equity, I think you said to 0 or negative 1 year, what's like a long-term goal for that? And what would that mean in terms of adding securities or adding swaps to your current position?","William S. Demchak","Well, just a couple of comments on the book. One of the things you will have noticed if you done the peer comparisons, if you look at our -- we put our after-tax loss up, but if you look at the pretax equivalent of that against the notional of our book, you'd come with a conclusion that it's a very short duration book. As we've said before, a big chunk of that is floating. So don't get hung up on the notional book relative to what we would do in terms of closing the duration gap on equity. With respect to outright by volume that we could do to get to a positive duration of equity, all I would tell you is it's a substantial amount. And there's been times in our history, in fact, we got this really right going into the rate rally post the crisis, I think our duration of equity was north of what, Rick? 3 or 4 years.","Richard J. Johnson","Yes, exactly.","William S. Demchak","So there's a lot of room to go from here and big impact ultimately on NII when and if we get to that point. But we haven't put out and I'm not going to quantify what a year's worth of duration of equity is in terms of security balances.","Richard J. Johnson","But what you can take away is just based upon the portfolio activity we did in the second quarter and the investments we've made to date that are going out into the third and the fourth is you can expect about a $1.5 billion to $2 billion increase in average security balances going into the third quarter.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Maybe some additional securities settling in the fourth quarter then?","Richard J. Johnson","Correct. And some swaps that are going to settle in 2014, which will also add net interest income over time.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Meaning the swaps in 2014 that settle in 2014 are currently a drag?","Richard J. Johnson","Yes.","William S. Demchak","Well, they're not a drag, just...","Richard J. Johnson","It's just not there.","William S. Demchak","When we reinvested the proceeds, basically the drop price on a forward settled security and\/or starting swap, the implied financing -- to bore you with details, the implied financing price of settling that forward was negative. It was a big yield pick up to start forward, so that's what we did.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, got it. So just -- I mean, in summary there, you had some swaps roll off in 2Q, you replaced them with some swaps that will kick in, in 2014 and boost the net interest income then?","William S. Demchak","Yes.","Richard J. Johnson","I think the most important thing is we will have loan balance increases in the third quarter versus the second. We'll have security balance increases in the third versus the second. And in both loans and securities, the yields will be down. And -- but to the tune of where purchase accounting accretion will cause you to have a modest decline in net interest income.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Steve Scinicariello from UBS.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just real quick, just given the strong loan growth that we saw in the quarter, I mean, up 1.75%, C&I up 3%, just kind of curious what were really some of the strong drivers there, and how sustainable? I know the growth is for modest -- guidance is for modest growth, but how sustainable are some of these kind of underlying trends that you're seeing just as you look ahead?","William S. Demchak","Well, on the commercial side, we continue to benefit from the verticals in the specialty lending, so you saw a growth in asset-based lending. Interestingly, some of that growth coming on the back of utilization increases, which is the first time in a long time we've seen that. And you see growth in real estate balances largely as a function of utilization increases as projects fund up and get completed, although we had good originations there as well. Specialty lending in some of the verticals and in health care and public finance, our equipment leasing business, we feel pretty good about the activity in those businesses. If we were relying on pure plain-vanilla senior secured commercial middle market, I'd have a different take on what we could do. But the specialty stuff is -- continues to play out for us.","Richard J. Johnson","I think we're also on the consumer side, right? This is the first time we've seen an increase in home equity -- net home equity balances. I think as housing prices have rebounded a bit, people are getting a little bit more equity in their home and are able to borrow against that. So that was good to see that balance go up. We haven't seen that in several quarters.","William S. Demchak","Yes.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. So just sounds like you're being a little conservative maybe on the modest growth outlook perhaps, or what would be some of the constraining factors then?","William S. Demchak","I mean, look, we hope we'd be able to grow faster the good risk-adjusted return. I would tell you that the market, certainly, in certain sectors is getting increasingly competitive and there's areas where we're choosing to walk away given the spread or structure on the loan where 1.5 years ago, we wouldn't have because you would've been paid better for it. So that's probably the constraint is just relative competition and the degree to which the credit markets get overheated here.","Richard J. Johnson","And plus, we still have run-off in the education lending, we've get run-off in the non-strategic assets, residential mortgage, yes, exactly. So I think you're going to see balances that are putting pressure on downward as well.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the last question, in terms of borrower demand. I guess I'm just curious as to whether or not you saw a meaningful decline in borrower demand as rates were going up in June. And if you did, if you saw an improvement in demand heading into this, heading into July, particularly in some of the verticals that you mentioned where you've seen somewhat stronger growth?","William S. Demchak","We didn't -- in terms of fundings and pipelines, I don't know that you saw it. Anecdotally, when rates first spiked, you hear a lot of comments of kind of deer in the headlights and people just choosing not to make a decision. But in terms of just volumes, I don't know that, that necessarily flowed through anything. We did see less so in our books given the business we're in, but on the leverage credit side and high yield in the larger syndicated leverage loans, we obviously saw a complete freeze in the market when rates went up, as people were trying to react to that. But that didn't really impact us.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Then just couple of housekeeping questions. Rick, I think you said the -- if I heard you correctly, the portfolio duration of the AFS portfolio, you said, I believe, was between 3 and 3.5 years now. Is that -- did I hear you correctly?","Richard J. Johnson","I'd say...","William S. Demchak","It's duration of equity.","Richard J. Johnson","Yes, that's the duration of equity, and that was a negative [indiscernible]. Securities portfolio is about 2.5 to 3 years.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So that really hasn't changed much since the end of the first quarter?","Richard J. Johnson","No. That's correct.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I noticed in the home equity portfolio, it looks like recoveries improved pretty visibly quarter-over-quarter at -- to the highest level in more than 1 year, net charge-offs in that portfolio continue to come down. But nonperforming asset balances are up about nearly 60% year-over-year. Is there something going on there, or is that more due to just the regulatory guidance?","Richard J. Johnson","Well, keep in mind that the decline in the charge-offs in the home equity was because of the policy change we made in the first quarter, and that hit home equity, as well as residential mortgage. And in total, that was about $134 million. So the first quarter was inflated, I guess, is what I would say, and obviously, it's kind of come down in terms of charge-offs. On nonperforming, you've got -- we're seeing a little bit of risk in the home equity. I think you've seen that nonperforming number going up each of the last 5 quarters.","William S. Demchak","But we have -- but inside of nonperforming, we have the same nickel balances, right?","Richard J. Johnson","We do.","William S. Demchak","Yes. So that -- so it has been a change in what is considered nonperforming, which has caused some of that increase.","Operator","Next question, from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of follow-up questions. One is on the Basel III final rules, so that got done. Wondering what BlackRock was designated as? Is it designated as a financial institution? And does that change how you think about it?","William S. Demchak","We've got 1,000 pages we're looking through and we're studying the whole thing, but we really don't have a view right now on exactly how that's going to be handled. We're still sticking with, at least at the moment, in the ratios we put out here for you based on the original MTRs and based on our understanding of that.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Secondly, on the expense ratio. Bill, in the past, you've mentioned how part of the reason why structurally your expense ratio is higher than peers and your tax rate lower is because how you structure some of your affordable programs, affordable housing programs, if that's the correct term for it. And just wondering, is there anything afoot to potentially changing that structure, or you stick with what you got?","William S. Demchak","So we're not changing the business. It's a very high return business for us. It just looks confusing on the income statement. But the economics to shareholders are good, and so we'll continue it.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So the structure remains the same?","Richard J. Johnson","That's correct.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then just lastly on the Southeast franchise, I mean, we've talked a lot about how that's been a contributor to growth here this quarter. Could you give us a sense as to where it is on all the metrics that you manage to efficiency ratio, sales ratio, FTE efficiency, all that kind of stuff, how it is stacking in ranking relative to the rest of the bank? And what kind of time frame it takes to get to rest of the bank levels? I'm basically trying to understand are we going to be accelerating from here, or is the rate of change that we experienced this quarter high or likely to persist?","William S. Demchak","Well, a couple of things. Without -- we don't have exact internal metrics where we'd compare efficiencies by regions. But I would tell you without having those, that the Southeast is much worse than everywhere else. And Rick is looking at me. I guess because of accretion accounting that...","Richard J. Johnson","It's almost like the story at the top of the house. You get the purchase accounting accretion causing the efficiency to be good, and that's going to run off as we grow fee income.","William S. Demchak","But the core activity on those markets is well below what we -- in other markets, and that's the opportunity set. What you see in terms of growth is interesting because we continued to run off non-core balances in the market. There's a lot of investor owned real estate stuff that we just don't want. If we have been able to do that and replace it with clients that we do like and balances that we do like. The time line on it, we think of the Southeast as we want to turn that into the next Philadelphia or Cleveland or big market. So we don't sort of this is in a 1- or 2- or a 3-year game. It's going to be a long-term game where we're in those markets and turn those markets into markets that behave like our legacy markets, which are materially more productive today than what we see in the South. We knew that going in. We're pleased with where we've gotten to today. My guess is it'll continue to improve through time based on what we're seeing.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Sure. So the rate of change that we're seeing this quarter likely to persist for a bit? I mean, obviously, it's kind of a fade out in terms of rate of change but increase in terms of total dollar contribution to overall PNC?","William S. Demchak","I'd like to think so, yes, yes.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I guess I'm just wondering, is it's possible at some point, to maybe sketch out that how you guys are seeing that rate of change in that time frame. It would be helpful, because I think a lot of the questions on the call have to do with, as you well know, the expense ratio, and just triangulating to that would be helpful.","William S. Demchak","Yes, fair enough. I mean, we don't -- because we don't -- purposely don't do regional P&Ls given some things are regional, some are centralized, we don't run the company that way. But we do look at metrics in the Southeast in terms of levels of activities and loan balances and clients, and we can do better and should do better going forward to put some of those metrics out to you guys.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. Number one, Bill, you escaped the net of the leverage ratio at least this time around, which applies to the top 6 institutions. Do you have any concerns if that's going to get sort of pushed down the banking size ladder as time goes on?","William S. Demchak","Not particularly. They kind of came out with it. It doesn't impact us as defined, and it certainly hasn't come up in sort of any of the speeches that I've heard. I would tell you -- did we put this out [ph]?","Richard J. Johnson","Well, even as defined, we exceed both the 5% or 6% number.","William S. Demchak","Yes, we're comfortably above at where we are today, and our business model would -- arguably, we're not changing our business model. So even as we grow and continue to support those higher levels. So it didn't cause us a lot of concern one way or the other.","Richard J. Johnson","Right.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And on the issue of acquisitions, future acquisitions, there has been a lot of complaining in Washington because the largest banks have increased market share so much, and the interim since the financial crisis and a lot of that share, of course, has been buying failed institutions, which the Congress folks seemed to ignore. And you, of course, were the beneficiary of not a failed institution but a marginal one, to put it nicely. And do you foresee any point at which you think you might get pushed back if you wanted to do another sizable deal? I mean, are they going to sort of try to constrain the size of the banking industry as it stands right now?","William S. Demchak","I don't -- I just don't know, right? Everybody talks about that. As a practical matter, we got approval to do RBC. We haven't really focused on it because we have enough on our plate today in terms of what we're trying to accomplish and grow. So since acquisitions haven't really been on our radar, we haven't been too sensitized to whether they would let us do it or not, to be honest with you.","William H. Callihan","So I think that was our last question. Bill, if you have any closing comments.","William S. Demchak","Yes. Just real quickly, so this is after 8 years of doing these calls, this is Rick's last time doing the call. I'll be joined in the third quarter by Rob Reilly. But on behalf of the firm, I'd just say thank you to Rick for helping us steer through what was a fairly remarkable 8 years for our company in the economy, and we greatly appreciate it.","Richard J. Johnson","Thank you, Bill.","William S. Demchak","Thanks a lot, everybody. We'll see you in the third quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call for today. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great day, everyone."],"17158":["PNC Financial Services Group (NYSE:PNC) Q3 2012 Earnings Call October 16, 2012  9:00 AM ET","Executives","William H.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PNC Financial Services Group Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bill Callihan. Sir, please go ahead.","William H. Callihan","Thank you, Mira, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Rohr; and Rick Johnson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Actual results and future events could differ, possibly materially, by those anticipated in our statement and from historical performance due to a variety of risks and other factors. Information about such factors, as well as GAAP reconciliation and other information on non-GAAP financial measures we may discuss, is included in today's conference call earnings release, related presentation material and in our 10-K, 10-Qs, 8-Ks and various other SEC filings and investor material. All of -- these are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under the Investor Relations section. These statements speak only as of October 16, 2012, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim Rohr.","James E. Rohr","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This was an outstanding quarter for PNC. We earned $925 million in net income or $1.64 per diluted common share. Our strong overall performance was driven by our ability to increase the number of customers that we serve, grow loans and fees, resulting in higher revenue.","Total loans increased by $1.5 billion in the third quarter, primarily driven by commercial loan growth. The majority came from new customers as utilization rates remained essentially unchanged. As we expected, the rate of loan growth in the third quarter was slower than the first half of the year. However, for the first 9 months of the year, loans have increased by almost $23 billion or 14%, a strong gain.","Fee income of $1.7 billion was up 23% compared to $1.4 billion the same quarter a year ago. We sold some of our Visa stock during the quarter, which continued to the -- contributed to the increase in this category. But without the pretax gain of $137 million from the Visa sale, our noninterest income was up 13% from the same period a year ago and reflects higher quality as the overall client fee income remained strong.","And more than 3\/4 of our markets were above plan for the first 9 months of the year. Our southeastern markets are performing well and are above our expectations. Taken together, our sales performance, along with the contributions from all of our employees, is basically driving these results.","Overall credit quality improved and expenses were well managed, and Rick will cover these in greater detail. At the quarter end, our balance sheet remained core funded with an 88% loan-to-deposit ratio, and we remain -- and we maintained a strong liquidity position.","And we continue to improve the quality of our capital. We recently issued $480 million in preferred stock with a dividend rate of 5.38% -- 5 3\/8%. The offering was well received by the market. And during the first 9 months of the year, we redeemed a total of $1.8 billion in trust preferred securities that had a weighted average rate of more than 7%, and obviously, redeeming these securities is lowering our funding cost. And finally, our Tier 1 common capital ratio increased from the second quarter and is estimated to be 9.5% as of September 30.","Overall, I'm very pleased with these results. Clearly, 2012 is shaping up to be another strong year for PNC.","Now I'd like to spend a few moments talking about the performance of our business segments. In all my years of banking, I've never seen us grow the numbers of customers we serve as quickly as we are today. Let me begin with Retail Banking. We're looking to add customers, serve them efficiently -- sufficiently and deepen our relationships with them through cross-selling.","We added more than 230,000 net organic checking relationships during the first 9 months of the year. On an annualized basis, organic checking accounts increased 4% during the same period. That's twice as fast as the population growth rate in our footprint. Additionally, we acquired 460,000 checking accounts through our acquisition of RBC Bank (NYSE:USA) in the first quarter of the year. In the third quarter, nearly 70% of our new checking accounts were relationship accounts, as more customers are seeing the value of having deeper relationships with us as opposed to having just a free checking account.","As customer behaviors are changing, they want easy access to their money. Reflecting that need, we deployed more than 1,000 image-enabled ATMs through the end of September. This is a key initiative in our efforts to lower our cost of business and enhance service.","We're also seeing significant growth in mobile deposit, such as using a smartphone to deposit a check. We're now seeing approximately 8,600 mobile deposits per day, up from 7,000 since we -- since the last time we talked. Since the beginning of the year, active online banking and active online bill payment increased organically by 12% and 7%, respectively. As more customers migrate to this channel, we should see greater customer retention, as well as cost efficiencies.","Our Corporate & Institutional Bank had a very good third quarter, driven by our focus on customer growth. During the first 9 months of the year, we've added approximately 775 new primary clients in Corporate Banking as we work to complete our build out in the southeast and leverage our regional president model. While this rate of client growth is lower than what we saw in the past 2 years, the climate has become more competitive, and we remain focused on earning the appropriate risk-adjusted returns. These new names are helping to drive loan originations, as well as fee growth.","Average loans in C&IB increased by more than $3 billion linked quarter due to strong loan growth from new and existing client activity in Corporate Banking and real estate finance. For the first 9 months of the year, average loans grew by nearly $18 billion, an increase of 25%. Treasury management revenue year-to-date increased by 11% over last year, and capital markets revenue was up 4% during the same period.","Our Asset Management Group saw good client growth and improved performance in the equity markets during the third quarter. For the first 9 months of the year, new primary clients were nearly 25% higher compared to the same period last year. On a year-to-date basis, referral sales were up nearly 21% compared to the same period last year, reflecting strong activity from Retail and Corporate & Institutional Banking. At the end of the third quarter, assets under administration increased to $222 billion, a 10% increase from the same time a year ago.","PNC Wealth Insight, our tool for wealth management customers, was recently honored by CIO magazine as an innovation that delivers a competitive advantage. Wealth Insight provides an aggregated view of a customer's assets even those not managed by PNC. Clients can customize that view based on how they think about their money. Approximately 10,000 customers have been given access to Wealth Insight, and the adoption rate now exceeds 70%.","Residential Mortgage saw strong loan production in the third quarter. Originations were up 29% through the first 9 months of the year over the same period last year, primarily driven by refinancing and HARP activity. We continue to make strides to enhance our purchase originations, and as refinancing activity decreases, this will drive longer term value for this business.","At BlackRock, we'll report its earnings tomorrow. But overall, our businesses performed very well during the first 9 months of the year, setting the stage for a strong full year performance.","And now, Rick will provide you with more detail about our third quarter results. Rick?","Richard J. Johnson","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter net income was $925 million or $1.64 per diluted common share. This resulted in a return on average assets of 1.23% and a return on tangible common equity of 14.3%.","In my remarks today, I will focus on our loan growth and the favorable shift in our deposit mix, the impact of purchase accounting accretion on our net interest income and margin, our growth in quality fee income, our overall improvement in credit quality and our disciplined expense, capital and liquidity management.","As you can see on Slide 6, total loans increased by $1.5 billion, or 1%, on a linked quarter basis. The primary driver was total commercial loan growth, which increased by $1 billion, or 1%, due to expanding relationships in the health care industry and commercial real estate.","On the consumer side, loan increased by nearly $400 million, or 1%, linked quarter. Gains in indirect auto lending of $1.2 billion were partially offset by runoffs in residential real estate and lower education loans. The growth in indirect auto loans included a portfolio purchased in September of approximately $500 million.","Now turning to liabilities. Transaction deposits were up by $2.3 billion linked quarter, reflecting increases in both consumer and commercial liquidity. Retail CDs declined by $1.2 billion due to the runoff of maturing accounts, and time deposits decreased by $1.7 billion, primarily reflecting lower Eurodollar deposits. Transaction deposits now account for 82% of total deposits, reflecting our strong customer focus, and our overall deposits remained stable linked quarter, resulting in a loan-to-deposit ratio of 88%.","Our Tier 1 common capital ratio improved by 20 basis points due to growth in retained earnings and is estimated to be 9.5% as of September 30, 2012.","Now let's turn to net interest income on Slide 7. Third quarter net interest income was $2.4 billion, a decline of $127 million from last quarter, reflecting an expected decline in purchase accounting accretion as core net interest income remained relatively stable. Purchase accounting accretion decreased due to -- by $98 million due to lower cash recoveries on impaired loans of $30 million, lower accretion on performing loans of $40 million and lower accretion on CDs of $30 million. Going forward, we should not expect further material declines related to cash recoveries and CDs, and the decline related to performing loans should be marginally lower.","As you can see from the graph on Slide 7, while overall net interest margin contracted by 26 basis points on a linked quarter basis, the majority of this decline, over 16 basis points, was driven by the runoff of purchase accounting accretion. In addition, core margin declined by 10 basis points, 3 basis points of this decline coming from a $17 million charge in the third quarter on debt hedge ineffectiveness and a 7 basis point core margin contraction.","Compared to the prior year quarter, net interest income increased $224 million, or 10%, due to strong growth in core net interest income, driven by strong organic loan growth, the RBC Bank acquisition and a 6 basis point improvement in core net interest margin. On a 9-month basis, our core net interest income is up $715 million, or 11%, due to strong growth in core net interest income due to strong organic loan growth and the impact of the RBC Bank acquisition, as our NIM remained relatively stable at 3.93%.","Now looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect net interest income will remain stable, as we anticipate an improvement in core net interest income will be partially offset by a $30 million to $35 million decline in purchase accounting accretion related to performing loans. We also expect our core margin contraction to ease, possibly resulting in a stable core interest margin from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.","As we said before, we expect purchase accounting accretion in 2013 of $650 million will be approximately $400 million less than the full year 2012 accretion of approximately $1,050,000,000. Despite this decline, we expect total revenues in 2013 to exceed total revenues in 2012.","As you can see on Slide 8, third quarter noninterest income reflected strong performances in several fee categories. Asset Management fees were up $27 million, or 10%, on a linked quarter basis due to growth in primary clients, improvements in the equity markets and fee income growth. Consumer and corporate service fees remained stable compared to second quarter results.","Residential Mortgage banking fees were driven by higher origination activity and higher spreads. These results were offset by lower hedge gains on mortgage servicing rights. On mortgage repurchase activity, GSE demands continue to track expectations. The $37 million recorded for the Residential Mortgage repurchase provisions in the third quarter reflects new origination activity and modest refinements to our life of the loan reserve estimates. Service charges on deposits were up $8 million, or 6%, linked quarter due to increased customer activity.","Other fee income was higher, primarily due to pretax gain of $137 million on our sale of $5 million of our Visa common shares. Our Visa holdings had increased in value by nearly 16 -- 60% during the past 12 months, and we felt it was time to monetize some of this gain. We continue to hold approximately 18 million shares of Visa Class B common stock with an estimated market value of more than $1 billion as of September 30, 2012. These shares are recorded on our books at about $300 million, resulting in an unrecognized value of nearly $700 million pretax.","Another driver of other fee income in the third quarter was the increased value of hedges on deferred compensation obligations due to higher stock market prices. These higher prices also resulted in a similar increase in personnel expenses. Compared to the prior year quarter, fee income increased $320 million, or 23%. When the pretax gain for the sale of the Visa shares is excluded, fee income growth continues to be strong with an increase of $183 million, or 13%. On a year-to-date basis, and despite the impact of the Durbin Amendment, our noninterest income grew 6% when the residential mortgage repurchase provisions and Visa gain are excluded.","As you can see at the bottom of the chart, the percentage of fee income to total revenue is moving from the high-30s to the low-40s. As we continue to cross-sell in our new markets, we expect to see the percentage increase as we continue to deepen our relationships with the growing number of customers we serve.","Turning to Slide 9, total expenses were flat in the third quarter compared to the second. In the third quarter, personnel expenses increased partially due to the impact of higher equity markets on deferred compensation obligations. As I mentioned earlier, the impact of the increase was hedged and a gain was recorded in other noninterest income. Personnel expenses also increased due to higher business volumes and revenues in Residential Mortgage, Retail and Corporate Banking. Other expense declined primarily as a result of higher additions to legal reserves in the prior quarter.","Our core expenses for the third quarter and year-to-date increased compared to the same period a year ago, primarily due to operating expenses related to the RBC Bank and several factors, which include costs to comply with mortgage foreclosure-related consent decrees and OREO-related costs. We also continued to invest in our businesses during this period, especially in our newer markets.","Third quarter integration costs of $35 million, or $0.04 per share, were lower than prior quarter and lower than expected due to the timing of integration expenses. Looking ahead, we expect integration costs of approximately $51 million in the fourth quarter.","We had noncash charges of $95 million, or $0.12 per share, in the third quarter related to redeeming nearly $1 billion in trust preferred securities. In the fourth quarter, we expect possible noncash charges of $67 million, assuming a redemption and remarketing of approximately $500 million in hybrid capital with a current all-in funding cost of 12%. If we complete the planned remarketing process, we will need to replace this funding with bank holding company debt in the near future.","Turning to our continuous improvement targets in 2012. We are looking to exceed a total of $550 million in annualized cost savings at legacy PNC and in integration savings at RBC Bank. We have identified more than 600 initiatives to deliver these savings goals, capturing more than $417 million in estimated year-to-date savings. This gives us confidence that we will exceed our cost-saving targets.","Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 23.6%. As you know, this rate is generally lower than the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax credits we receive from our investments in low-income housing partnerships and other tax-exempt investments.","Now overall credit quality continued to improve in the third quarter with the linked quarter declines in nonperforming assets and overall delinquencies. Our nonperforming assets and net charge-offs results would have been lower, except this quarter, in accordance with regulatory guidance, we classified certain accruing consumer loans post-Chapter 7 bankruptcy as nonperforming loans and charged the loan balance down to the value of the collateral. As a result, NPLs and charge-offs were higher by $112 million and $83 million, respectively. We also added $50 million to the provision and to our allowance for loan losses during the quarter to provide for these risks.","Approximately 90% of these loans were current on their payments as of the end of the third quarter. As a result, we expect to see recoveries on these loans. As expected, our provision for the third quarter was $228 million, was in the range of $150 million to $250 million, and we expect the same in the fourth quarter. Overall, we expect continued improvement in asset quality in the fourth quarter as well.","Turning to Slide 11. Our Tier 1 common ratio at the end of the third quarter is estimated to be 9.5%, up 20 basis points from the second quarter, primarily due to retained earnings. Our capital priorities for 2012 remain the same, and we continue to maintain strong bank and parent company liquidity.","PNC's goal is to be within a Basel III Tier 1 common ratio range of 8% to 8.5% by year-end 2013 without the benefit of phase-ins. We believe we are well positioned to reach this goal.","As Jim mentioned, we recently issued another $480 million of preferred stock. This brings our overall preferred position to $3.6 billion of qualifying capital under Basel III. This brings us to within $1 billion of our goal of $4.6 billion or 1.5% of the Tier 1 capital structure. As we get more clarity about the new Basel III rules and progress with our model development, we will increase our capital disclosures.","Overall, this was a strong quarter for PNC, and with that, I'll hand it back to Jim.","James E. Rohr","Thank you, Rick. Overall, we believe our focus on attracting new customers, growing revenue and effectively managing expenses and capital represents a winning formula for creating long-term shareholder value. Our third quarter performance reflects these factors, and we believe the full year reported performance will also be strong.","As we look ahead, we've clearly positioned the firm for a low interest rate environment and modest economic growth. Now we would like to have a better environment than that, but nonetheless, we have not completed our 2013 budget process. We believe our recent trends in customer loan and fee income growth will allow us to increase revenue on a year-over-year basis. Combined with our demonstrated ability to successfully manage our risks and costs, this gives me confidence that PNC is positioned to have another good year in 2013.","And with that, we would be pleased to take your questions.","William H. Callihan","Mira, if you would give our participants instructions, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill.","Scott Siefers","Rick, just had a couple of questions on the margin. You gave some pretty good color on the fourth quarter expectations. I wonder if you can just speak at a top level about some of the puts and takes from a core basis. And I noticed the yields on most of the categories of the loan portfolio were down, in some cases, kind of substantially. I imagine that's mostly the purchase accounting adjustments. But just I'm curious to what kind of pricing pressures you're seeing out there on the asset side. And then on the funding side, you alluded to potentially some additional TruPS redemptions, so any comments you can make about further lowering your overall funding costs. And I guess along those lines, I noticed the cost of your Retail CDs kind of jumped up in the third quarter. Just curious what was going on there, and then if you can speak to overall deposit cost expectations as well.","Richard J. Johnson","Okay. That's quite a bit, Scott. Thank you. Let's start with the assets, yield on assets. I mean, obviously, as I mentioned, we'll continue to see a decline in the purchase accounting accretion on performing loans. Last quarter, that was about a $40 million decline from second to third, and we think that'll be about a $30 million to $35 million decline from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So obviously, that's going to have an impact on the yields. If you think of the core yields, this quarter, we saw loan yields come down about 14 basis points. That was a pretty severe movement for us relative to prior quarters. I expect, depending on the mix of business we put on -- what happened between the second and third quarters, we did put on a lot of municipal business, we did put on a lot of business through our conduit, which tend to run with lower yields than the regular portfolio, and so you saw the yields drop there, although it's very good business and we're quite pleased with it. We don't see the yields dropping as much in the fourth quarter. But again, I think that will depend very much on the mix of business that we put on. On the securities portfolio, we're running down about $1 billion a month. That's about $3 billion a quarter. As it runs off, we replace about a 3.3% asset with about a 2.3% asset as we bring on residential mortgage-backed securities. A little bit of a mix shift there as well, as we're not trying to take long-dated positions with our security portfolio. We're keeping it very short dated and so we may give up a little bit of earnings in doing that, but we don't believe it's appropriate to put our capital at risk. In terms of reduced funding costs, clearly, the TruPS we've exercised already this year, about $1.8 billion, plus the $500 million we'll do in the fourth quarter, is going to continue to reduce funding costs. And in fact, that is one of the reasons why I'm so confident that the contraction in the margin will ease in the fourth quarter relative to the second to third quarter, simply because we're going to get back a lot on the TruPS funding cost that we have there. So I think the borrowing costs continue to decline. I think the CDs are done. We finished that in the second quarter. There's not a lot more to do on the CD front. But clearly, we can continue to do further on the borrowing front. The Retail CDs, Scott, that was just a correction of an error in the second quarter. We had a $20 million adjustment on our yield year-to-date, which caused the second quarter to look much lower than the third quarter. If you adjusted for that, you'd probably have pretty flat yields on CDs over the 3 quarters in second, third -- first, second to third. And then also on the deposit side, as I mentioned, I think, really, not a lot of room right now, I think, on the CD side. We'll continue to evaluate it or -- on overall deposit costs, but I think they've pretty much repriced on that.","James E. Rohr","One of the things, Scott, is that -- one of the things we're not doing is we're not putting long-dated mortgages on our balance sheet. As Rick said, we're remaining short. We don't think you're getting paid to take risk and take that kind of long-dated risk in this interest rate environment. So that's one thing that you might see other banks doing and going out the yield curve, either in the securities book or even more so in booking residential mortgages on their balance sheet. That's just something that we don't think that's the right risk to be taking at this time.","Scott Siefers","Well, it makes sense. Okay. I had some -- no, I had a bunch of little ones in there, but I definitely appreciate the color.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies & Company.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if -- first, if you could kind of walk us through the proportion of the expense base that today, in the third quarter, is still related to environmental costs. And if -- both on the expense side and I guess, also, we know the repurchase number was still a little bit higher than what you had been talking about. So if you can also just kind of put that into context for us. So all things related to environmental cost drag on the current numbers.","Richard J. Johnson","Yes, happy to. We didn't have a lot of litigation in the quarter. I think there was about $13 million in total litigation costs. We ended up with about $45 million related to the mortgage foreclosure activity. That was a little bit elevated in the quarter, up from normal levels of about $30 million a quarter. And then the last item would have been the OREO costs, which came in at about $35 million for the quarter.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the putback was 37, but you guys have been talking to 5 to 10 kind of go forward. Is this a true-up? Or is this a change relative to that prior outlook?","Richard J. Johnson","Well, we provided -- it is an update. We provided, one, for the originations in the quarter, which would have been about $5 million, and then we had a true-up of the reserve that we had, obviously, less than a 10% adjustment on the total reserve as we just -- more information as we're making our estimates. What I've been very pleased with is the fact that the -- what we have been expecting from Fannie and Freddie is exactly what's happening. We appeared to hit a peak of demand in the month of May, and it's been coming down since. The month of September was the lowest-cost month we've had since February. So not that any one month makes a trend, but I'd say that everything we're seeing on the GSEs is just as we expected.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And my second question, just related to the outlook for overall revenue growth in 2013. So we know about the purchase accounting delta. I was wondering if you can just kind of, first of all, give us the kind of base for whatever core stuff you're -- or noncore stuff you're excluding from when you consider growth over. That will be helpful, I think, to understand. And then two, if you can just help us understand the components of NII versus fees in terms of getting to growth in '13.","James E. Rohr","2013.","Richard J. Johnson","Well, that's correct. The total revenue guidance we're giving you is that reported revenues next year will exceed reported revenues this year.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So in all-in to all-in, Rick, like no tease-outs from the...","James E. Rohr","They're all in. We're not adjusting for anything.","James E. Rohr","That's pretty specific guidance for next year already, so.","Richard J. Johnson","But we've given it already.","James E. Rohr","Well, yes, that we've given out already. So we'll update that to some extent when we get to the Goldman conference in December. But -- when we start talking about 2013 after we get the budget done.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes. I think the questions are just coming in on -- relative to the slightly lower-than-expected NII starting point, if that does, in fact, change the overall outlook. That's the questions that are coming in today.","Richard J. Johnson","No. My comments today, I re-upped that guidance for you to say that total revenue 2013 will exclude total revenue of 2012.","James E. Rohr","Exceed, exceed.","Richard J. Johnson","That's what I said, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Penala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Well, I just wanted to follow up on some of the expense questions that were asked. Rick, the way you walked us through the environmental expenses, if I take out the TruPS charges and the integration charges from this year, it's -- or sorry, rather this quarter, you have an expense base of $2.52 billion. And if you take out the mortgage foreclosure charges and the OREO charges, that's an expense base of $2.4 billion. So clearly, there's -- those expenses aren't going to go to 0 next year. But in that $2.4 billion core number, could you give us a sense of how much the core -- or rather, legacy PNC expenses will grow under your revenue scenario next year and how much you can save out of RBC?","Richard J. Johnson","Well, we've said before that we will take the $150 million that we have planned to save this year in RBC, and on a full year basis, that will be $230 million next year. So that's been out there, and we're still comfortable with that. We haven't given any other guidance on expenses for next year, so I really can't give that today.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And a follow-up on Scott's question with regard to the movements in core versus purchase accounting accretion. Of the 45 basis points decline in C&I yields and the 52 basis points decline in CRE yields, could you give us a sense of what percentage was attributed to lower purchase accounting accretion?","Richard J. Johnson","Yes. Basically, core loan yields in total were down about 14 basis points in the quarter. So if you back out all your purchase accounting accretion, the second quarter loan yield was 4.21% and the third quarter loan yield was 4.07%. So that was a decline of 14 basis points that I mentioned before.","James E. Rohr","Yes.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just another follow-up question. In terms of your revenue expectations for next year, what are you assuming in terms of loan growth? And I know, Jim, that you've talked a lot about how corporates are apprehensive about borrowing more ahead of the fiscal cliff and the election. Getting past those data points or those events, do you think that demand will come back to what we saw in the first half of the year next year?","James E. Rohr","Well, I mean, we're still planning for a very low interest rate environment and very modest economic growth. I think that's the only way you can actually do any forecasting in this environment, not -- so that -- and we've talked to all of our customers, and the customers, as I mentioned, exact -- we hear the exact same thing, as you mentioned: that they're nervous about taxes, they're nervous about health care costs, they're nervous about the fiscal cliff. So you see them not borrowing. And I think the utilization rate being flat again, and this is years now where it's been flat, where people are spending money on -- they're spending money on things that generate economies right off the bat and efficiency. But we're really just not seeing people plunking out a lot of dough to expand their business and build plants and hire a lot of people because of the environmental factors that we have. Now we've been in this mode for quite some time. It's improved. It's improved some. Of course, it's better than it was in '08 and '09 and '10. But when you look at the reluctance to have a big increase, I think it's -- it causes you to just remain very cautious about what your planning is. Now to take the other side of that, if we could somehow build confidence in the economy, there's so much money sitting on the sidelines, not just large corporations, but small companies. Small businesses have a lot of cash. 80% of small businesses never borrow. So there could be a nice lift if we could build confidence back into the economy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","The next question comes from Paul Miller with FBR.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Hey, guys, can you go back a little bit to the mortgage-backed -- I mean, your securities portfolio? And you mentioned that you're replacing 3.3 with 2 -- or 3.3% yielding assets with 2.3% yielding assets. What type of mix shift is that? Because I think most people are looking at that low end being at 1.6%, 1.7%. Are you -- can you just explain that a little bit?","Richard J. Johnson","Well, we're -- yes, we're running off about $1 billion of residential mortgage-backed securities a month, which is about a $3 billion runoff in the quarter. The average yield in the overall securities book, I think, is about 3.4%, 3.3%. And if -- and we're buying, basically, 15-year mortgages is where we're at and -- mortgage-backed securities, and we're picking them up at about 2.35%.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And what's -- on the 15-year mortgages, the durations is going to be, what, around 5 years, 4 years?","Richard J. Johnson","Typically, what we're trying to keep our portfolio overall is around a 3-year average. So yes, you could be getting into the 4-year and then running down over time. So yes, that sounds about right.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And then on loan demand, I know a lot of people's asking about loan demand. Is there different geographic experiences? Like I know you guys are down in South. You're just getting there, and everybody's all hyped up about the Southeast and the housing recovery down there. Are you seeing more demand down there? Or are you just not really established yet down there?","James E. Rohr","We're -- a lot of it -- as we've said, the Southeast is outperforming our expectations, but it's early days for us there. We're just getting started. So in terms of moving the overall numbers, the Southeast won't do that this year. It's been an interesting year. And what's happened, and not only to ourselves but across the industry, in particular to ourselves, we've added a lot of customers and we've added customers with new loans. But if you look at the loan balances, it's somewhat inconsistent with the number of customers we've added. So as I mentioned in the presentation, we've added almost 800 new commercial and C&IB, commercial and institutional Bank customers. A lot of those are new loan customers, and 75% of our markets are over plan. And so they've had great sales years, but the balances in the third quarter didn't move up as rapidly as you might expect. That's partially because America continues to de-lever. So you see volumes picking up, which is good news, and you see consumer sales, retail sales picking up. And so you see more credit card activity, but you don't see more credit card outstandings. And you see more activity with adding customers with home equity lines, but yet, home equity line outstandings go down. So we're just -- as a country, we're seeing just continued deleveraging of the economy. The good news is we're able to add customers at a pace that exceeds the deleveraging without just booking mortgage loans on the books in order to make up for the lost NII.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Mike Turner with Compass Point.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Just really kind of following up to the earlier questions, more on new loan yields. I know C&I has been where most of the growth has come from. I mean, if I back out your accretion income, it's kind of rough, but I get a core loan yield of maybe 4 30-ish. Where would you say loans replacement yields are on average? I know there's multiple products going in there. But where would you say the replacement yields are coming on, on new originations?","James E. Rohr","Well, the spreads are anywhere from, as I'm looking in the sheet, 200 to 400 basis points, depending on the products mix. Somehow -- some of the products get -- in the asset-based lending, would get as high as 5. So it really depends on the mix. The middle-market spreads have been 200 over LIBOR, which is still -- it's lower than it was, but it's down about 30 basis points from a year ago. But still, a good spread for that business for good quality credit.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","And not -- I mean, it sounds like a little bit more competition from prior quarter, but not a -- I mean, how would you characterize the change from last quarter on those origination yields?","James E. Rohr","I think there's -- I mean, there's competition everywhere. As long as you're going to have 7,000 banks, you're going to have plenty of competition. And different people are more aggressive in different markets, so there is clearly competition. One of the things that's interesting to me is that we see people going out 15 and 25 years with loans, and I just find that to be something that's taking a risk profile that we're not willing to do. So the competition on spreads has come in some, but it's not as onerous as you might think. But in some of the duration, we've seen some pretty remarkable terms.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Rick, depending on the timing of the trust preferred redemption, which I don't know what the timing is in fourth quarter, what is that going to save you in terms of interest expense for fourth quarter?","Richard J. Johnson","I think that is an instrument we call in December.","James E. Rohr","Yes, yes.","Richard J. Johnson","Yes. So I don't think you'll see much in the fourth quarter, but you'll certainly see the benefit into the new year. So the benefit I was referring to in the fourth quarter is what we actually exercised in the third quarter.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","How late was that in the quarter?","James E. Rohr","That was kind of mid-quarter.","Richard J. Johnson","Mid-quarter, yes.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And how much would that benefit be, specifically?","Richard J. Johnson","That'd be about $10 million to $12 million.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So you're looking at accrete-able yield being down another $30 million in fourth quarter, offset a little bit by a $12 million improvement from the previous trust preferreds being paid. You're going to see core NII dollar growth in the quarter despite the fact your securities yields are falling and loan yields are falling. Is that just coming from organic balance sheet growth?","Richard J. Johnson","Yes, that's right. You got about 4 factors that are driving that. One is we did make this purchase of the auto portfolio, which was late in the quarter. We had purchased that in September. So you're going to get about $12 million of NII off of that. You've got some -- the wholesale funding, which is about 12 basis points. And then I mentioned before that, during the quarter, we had a $17 million charge in the third quarter related to a swap hedging debt and the ineffectiveness of that hedge, which we don't expect to repeat. So collectively, those are going add about $40 million to core NII in the quarter. And all other things being equal, we expect the rest will be flat.","Operator","I'm showing no further questions.","William H. Callihan","Okay.","James E. Rohr","Well, thank you very much for joining us this morning. We certainly appreciate that. We believe this is another very good quarter for PNC, and we look forward to a good fourth quarter as well. Thank you.","Richard J. Johnson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded, Wednesday, January 15, 2020. ","I will now turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bryan Gill. Sir, please go ahead.","Bryan Gill","Oh, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's conference call for The PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO. ","Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These materials are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. ","These statements speak only as of January 15, 2020, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them. ","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.","William Demchak","Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. You saw today that we reported full year 2019 results with net income of $5.4 billion or $11.39 per diluted common share. For the full year, we increased earnings per share, achieved record revenue, improved our efficiency ratio and generated positive operating leverage. Overall, it was an excellent year for PNC, capped by another solid quarter. ","We reported fourth quarter net income of $1.4 billion or $2.97 diluted per share. During the quarter, we grew loans, deposits and revenue. And while our provision increased, overall credit quality remains strong. Rob is going to take you through the full details of our financial results in just a second. And we remain dedicated and diligent in our continued investment in our businesses and technology to drive long-term growth. ","Along these lines, I was very pleased with the continued progress we made this quarter on our key strategic initiatives, including the national expansion of our middle market and retail banking efforts. We remain committed to growing our business but also maintaining an efficient organization capable of achieving positive operating leverage. ","I'd like to spend just a minute to thank our employees for all of their efforts to make 2019 a successful year. We achieved a great deal this past year for our customers, shareholders and the communities we serve, and none of it would have been possible without the combined efforts of our more than 51,000 employees working toward our common goals. ","As 2020 begins, we expect to face uncertainty in the year to come from the economic environment to the ramifications of international trade disputes, the geopolitical situation and a presidential election -- election campaign in the U.S., but we're excited about the momentum with which we've entered the year and along with our increased capital flexibility as a result of the tailoring rules , we believe our strategy, focus on -- our strategy and focus on our customers positions us well to continue to deliver for all of our constituencies. ","And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob, and then we'll be happy to take your questions.","Robert Reilly","Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill just mentioned, we reported full year net income of $5.4 billion or $11.39 per diluted common share. And fourth quarter net income was $1.4 billion or $2.97 per diluted common share. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. Total loans grew $1.2 billion to $239 billion linked quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, growth was $13 billion or 6%. Investment securities of $83.5 billion decreased $1.7 billion or 2% linked quarter due to portfolio runoff primarily in treasuries.","Year-over-year, total security balances increased $1.4 billion or 2%. Our cash balances at the Federal Reserve averaged $23 billion for the fourth quarter, up $7.7 billion linked quarter and $6.6 billion year-over-year, primarily as a result of strong deposit growth. ","Deposits grew $8.7 billion or 3% linked quarter and $21.3 billion or 8% year-over-year. As of December 31, 2019, our Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated to be 9.5% compared to 9.6% at September 30. ","For the full year 2019, we returned $5.4 billion of capital to shareholders. This represented a 22% increase over 2018 and was comprised of $1.9 billion in common dividends and $3.5 billion in share repurchases. Of note, the Tailoring Rules became effective January 1, 2020, and as a result, will provide us increased flexibility in managing both our capital and liquidity levels going forward. As we announced earlier this morning, we've received approval from the Federal Reserve to repurchase up to $1 billion in common shares through the end of the second quarter of 2020, which is in addition to the share repurchase programs of up to $4.3 billion, approved by the Fed as part of PNC's 2019 capital plan. This will provide us the ability to repurchase additional shares over the next two quarters, the level of which will depend on market conditions. ","Our return on average assets for the fourth quarter was 1.3%. Our return on average common equity was 11.5%, and our return on tangible common equity was 14.5%. Our tangible book value was $83.30 per common share as of December 31, an increase of 10% compared to a year ago. ","Slide 5 shows our average loans and deposits in more detail. Average loan balances of $239 billion in the fourth quarter were up $1.2 billion compared to the third quarter. The growth was driven by consumer lending, which increased $1.9 billion or 3%, reflecting higher residential mortgage, auto and credit card loan balances. ","Commercial lending decreased $738 million linked quarter as growth in our corporate banking business was more than offset by declines in our real estate business, primarily due to a $1.1 billion decrease in our multifamily warehouse balances. ","Compared to the same period a year ago, average loans grew 6% or $13 billion. Commercial lending balances increased $8.6 billion, and consumer lending balances increased $4.4 billion, each growing by 6%. As the slide shows, the yield on our loan balances declined in the fourth quarter, primarily the result of lower LIBOR rates. Importantly, the rate paid on our deposits also declined 15 basis points linked quarter, an acceleration in the pace of the decline from the third quarter of 2019. ","Deposits of $288 billion increased in both the year-over-year and linked quarter comparisons. The year-over-year increase of $21.3 billion or 8% reflected strong customer growth. Linked quarter deposits increased $8.7 billion or 3%, due, in part, to seasonal growth in commercial deposits. Notably, noninterest-bearing deposits grew $1.5 billion or 2% in the fourth quarter. Both comparisons benefited by a $3.4 billion increase related to the new sweep deposit product program we began offering our asset management clients in September. ","As you can see on Slide 6, full year 2019 revenue was a record $17.8 billion, up $695 million or approximately 4% driven by both higher net interest income and noninterest income. Expenses increased $278 million or 2.7% and remained well controlled. Importantly, we generated positive operating leverage of 1.4% in 2019. Our full year provision was $773 million, an increase of $365 million compared to 2018, which was driven by strong loan growth and continued credit normalization in our loan portfolio. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 15.1%, down from the third quarter as a result of lower state income taxes and tax credit benefits. For the full year, our 2019 effective tax rate was 16.4% and reflected the lower fourth quarter tax rate. ","Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to Slide 7, you can see our total revenue has grown consistently over the past several years driven by our diverse business mix. Full year 2019 net interest income was approximately $10 billion, a record for PNC and an increase of $244 million or 3% compared with 2018 as higher loan balances and yields were partially offset by higher funding costs. Our net interest margin decreased in 2019 to 2.89%, down 8 basis points compared to 2018 driven by the declining rate environment throughout the year. ","For the fourth quarter, net interest income of $2.5 billion was down $16 million or 1% from the third quarter. Lower loan and securities yields were substantially offset by lower funding costs. Net interest margin decreased 6 basis points to 2.78% in the fourth quarter, mostly due to the effect of lower interest rates, primarily LIBOR. Although lower rates reduced our borrowing costs, that benefit was more than offset by the downward impact of LIBOR in our commercial loan yields. Full year 2019 noninterest income was up $451 million or 6% and increased $132 million or 7% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Importantly, we continue to execute on our strategies to grow our fee businesses across our franchise, and those efforts helped to drive record fee income of $6.4 billion in 2019. ","During 2019, fee income increased $183 million or 3%, reflecting strong customer growth in our legacy and new markets. Growth was across all categories, except service charges on deposits. The $12 million or 2% decline in service charges on deposits was reflective of our ongoing efforts to simplify products and reduce transaction fees for our customers. Fourth quarter fee income of $1.7 billion increased $18 million or 1% compared to the third quarter. ","Taking a more detailed look at the performance in each of our fee categories. Asset management fees increased $40 million driven by higher earnings from PNC's investment in BlackRock. Consumer service fees declined $12 million or 3%, reflecting seasonally higher credit card activity that was more than offset by a full year true-up of credit card rewards. Corporate service fees grew $30 million or 6% across various categories and included growth in our treasury management product revenue. Residential mortgage noninterest income decreased 47 -- decreased by $47 million, driven by a lower benefit from RMSR hedge gains as well as lower loan sales revenue. Service charges on deposits increased $7 million or 4%, reflecting seasonally higher customer activity. ","The final component of our revenue, other noninterest income increased $114 million compared with the third quarter. The growth was primarily driven by higher revenue from private equity investments and a gain of $57 million related to the sale of our proprietary mutual funds. Partially offsetting this was a negative Visa derivative valuation adjustment of $45 million. ","Turning to Slide 8. Our full year 2019 expenses were $10.6 billion, an increase of $278 million or 2.7% compared with 2018 as we continue to invest in our strategies, technology and employees. Taking a look at the fourth quarter, expenses grew by $139 million or 5% linked quarter. Personnel increased $68 million due to higher benefits, including a special year-end grant to more than 51,000 of our employees mainly in the form of health savings account contributions, totaling $25 million. Personnel also reflected higher incentive compensation associated with business activity in the fourth quarter. Equipment expense increased $57 million largely due to $50 million of technology-related write-offs. These write-offs primarily resulted from the benefit of the tailoring rule, which now allows us to decommission compliance and regulatory systems that are no longer required. ","Our efficiency ratio for the full year 2019 was 59%, improving from 60% last year. As you know, expense management continues to be a focus for us, we had a 2019 goal of $300 million in cost saving through our continuous improvement program, and we successfully completed actions to achieve that goal. ","Looking forward to 2020, our annual CIP will once again be $300 million, which we expect to contribute to the funding of our business and technology investments. Our credit quality metrics are presented on Slide 9 and remained historically strong. Full year provision for loan losses totaled $773 million, and net charge-offs were $642 million in 2019, reflecting our strong loan growth and some credit normalization in our portfolio. ","On a linked-quarter basis, provision increased $38 million in the fourth quarter due to both consumer lending and reserves attributable to certain commercial credits. Net charge-offs increased $54 million to $209 million in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter. Commercial charge-offs accounted for $24 million of the increase driven primarily by a few specific credits. And consumer charge-offs grew $30 million, mostly related to our credit card and auto portfolios. ","Reserves to total loans remained stable year-over-year at 1.14% compared to 1.16% at year-end 2018. Annualized net charge-offs to total loans was 35 basis points in the fourth quarter. And while up, this is still well below our through-the-cycle average. Notably, the leading indicators for credit quality continue to perform well. Nonperforming loans were down $59 million or 3% compared to year-end 2018. And year-over-year, total delinquencies were up $19 million or 1%. ","As you know, we adopted CECL, the new accounting standard for credit losses, effective January 1, 2020. Based on our expectation of forecasted economic conditions and portfolio balances as of December 31, 2019, the adoption will result in an overall increase of approximately $650 million or 21% to our allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2019. The increase is driven by the consumer loan portfolio as longer-duration assets require more reserves under the CECL methodology. Our consumer reserve will increase approximately $900 million or 95%, and our commercial reserve will decrease approximately $250 million or 12%. These metrics include reserves for unfunded commitments. We plan to include a full description and transition details in our upcoming 10-K disclosure. ","As we move forward under CECL, it is the new accounting standard with many variables. And as a result, we expect more volatility in our quarterly provisioning. Our allowance for credit losses will be determined using various models and estimation techniques, utilizing, for example, historical losses, borrower characteristics, economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecast as well as other relevant factors. For expected losses in our reasonable and supportable forecast period of three years, we'll use four macroeconomic scenarios and their estimated probabilities. ","Given the multiple variables impacting provision expense under CECL, during 2020, we'll shift from our current practice of providing a quarterly provision guidance range to providing forecasted charge-off levels. However, in order to establish a context for the level of change in provision expense under CECL, for this upcoming quarter, we'll provide a range for expected provision expense, based simply on expected charge-off levels plus CECL reserve rates for net new loans. This guidance will assume our economic scenarios and weights remain constant. And should any of these variables change, either favorably or unfavorably, our actual provision expense may also vary possibly materially. ","In summary, PNC reported a successful 2019, and we're well positioned for 2020. Throughout 2020, we expect continued steady growth in GDP, and we expect interest rates to remain relatively stable. Taking these assumptions into consideration, our full year 2020 guidance compared to full year 2019 results is as follows. We expect loan growth to be in the range of 4% to 5%. We expect total revenue growth to be in the low end of the low single-digit range, which includes approximately 1% of net interest income growth. We expect expenses to be stable, and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 17.5%. Based on this guidance, we believe we'll generate positive operating leverage of approximately 1% in 2020. ","Looking at first quarter 2020 compared to fourth quarter 2019 results, we expect average loans to be up approximately 1%. We expect total net interest income to decline approximately 1%, reflecting one less day in the quarter. We expect fee income to be down approximately 3%. We expect other noninterest income to be between $300 million and $350 million, excluding net securities and Visa activity. We expect expenses to be down in the mid-single-digit range. And we expect provision to be between $225 million and $300 million. ","With that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.","John Pancari","On the provision guidance, the $225 million to $300 million for the quarter. Can you give us a little bit more color? I know going forward, you're going to guide more on charge-offs, as you said.","Robert Reilly","Yes.","John Pancari","But regarding the quarter, can you give us a little bit more color behind that $225 million to $300 million? How much of that is the CECL day two component? And then how much of that is reflecting underlying credit trends?","Robert Reilly","Yes. Sure. Yes. Sure, John. So for the first quarter guidance, I kept it simple. And we're just going to take forecasted charge-offs, which we expect to be at the same level that we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2019 and then add to that, the CECL loan loss rates for the fourth quarter of '19 to our projected loan growth. And that's the simple math.","John Pancari","Okay. Okay. And that is carrying forward, like you said, or assuming that fourth quarter charge-off level of 35 basis points, which was up a fair amount from last quarter and from the year ago. So that's the normalization you're talking about.","Robert Reilly","Yes.","John Pancari","Can you give us a little bit more detail around that normalization? I know you mentioned card and auto, but also, you had several commercial credits come up over the past several quarters that have been impacting? Is there a trend that you're seeing on the commercial side as well?","William Demchak","John, it's Bill. We talk about normalization, and we have for years where our charge-off rate is below what we would expect to see through the cycle. But I would tell you our near-term pressure on charge-offs is more related to card and auto than anything else. And it's not really related to change in the economy. We dipped our toe into some -- the lower end of our credit bucket, probably a year ago. And those vintages are starting to play through. We've subsequently shut that down six months ago. So it's going to work its way through the snake here. But I don't actually see, personally, that charge-offs are so much normalizing because of the economy per se as we have some elevated consumer stuff that will reverse through time. The other thing, we had a big debate internally just on what to guide as it related to provision going forward because CECL and the impact of CECL has so many variables on what provision will be. We can reasonably forecast charge-offs. But of course, outlook on economy, mix of loan growth, pace of loan growth, many other factors ultimately impact how that provision is going to behave beyond charge-offs. So we're giving it our best shot. It could be high or low, and we'll see.","Robert Reilly","Right. Well, it's new. CECL is new. And it's been a lot of work, as you know, both in terms of what we've done as we ran through parallel in 2019 to establish our transition amount. But going forward, we feel good about our framework. We've got a three year reasonable and supportable forecast. We've got the four macroeconomic scenarios that we'll detail in our 2020 disclosures. But to Bill's point, and what I said in my opening comments, there's just a lot of factors. And then on top of that, it's new.","William Demchak","Yes.","Robert Reilly","So there's just going to be some learn-curve aspects to sort of the practical application of CECL real time.","William Demchak","Yes. And on the C&I side, John, we really haven't seen anything that you'll see some specific credits we're adding to. By the way, we've been doing this for five years. What's changed is the recoveries that we've gotten through time...","Robert Reilly","Yes, that's right.","William Demchak","Way back from the crisis are gone. So it's not so much that our new stuff is elevated in any given point...","Robert Reilly","Changing.","William Demchak","As our recoveries have dropped.","John Pancari","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And if I could just ask one more on the margin side. I know you gave the spread income guidance for the linked quarter and for the full year expectation. But how do you think the margin will traject from here? Should we see some stabilization now that we have the pause?","Robert Reilly","Yes. Yes, I think so. I think so, John. We expect rates to be stable. We don't have NIM guidance officially. That's more of an outcome. But I think we'll spend most of the -- if everything stays constant, we'll spend the next year pretty much in this range. We could actually go up in a particular quarter as deposit costs are continuing to come down. But not a lot in either direction.","William Demchak","Yes. One of the things that hit us this quarter was just elevated amortization expense on our premium mortgage securities, which we think has probably hit its peak.","Robert Reilly","But I think we'll be in this range.","William Demchak","Yes.","Robert Reilly","Up or down.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Just wanted to ask a little bit more detail, Rob, about on the previous question. So how should we think about, one, the opportunity to deploy what seems like an extra $6 billion to $7 billion of cash. What opportunities you see for that cash going forward? And also, deposit costs trending down, sort of, balancing what has been a really successful initiative to go beyond your legacy footprint with reflecting lower rates.","Robert Reilly","Okay. Well, through the first part about that in terms of the new LCR requirements. We have and we'll continue to work down our cash balances to the new requirement of 85%. The first step is -- we talked about this on the third quarter call, is to pay down some short-term debt and then take a look going forward in terms of where we would deploy that. Unfortunately, securities yields aren't terrific. So I don't think we're going to move quickly in that direction but...","William Demchak","But the simplest thing to do is to let some of our wholesale borrowings run off, and that's what we've been doing.","Robert Reilly","Which is what we're doing, and we'll continue to do it. That's right.","William Demchak","Yes.","Robert Reilly","And, on the deposits.","William Demchak","Yes. I was just going to say, on the deposit side, we have been reasonably aggressive in dropping rates and have still been able to grow balances, both interest bearing and noninterest bearing so we're going to continue to pursue that. One of the things that's happening in the background here, of course, is the Fed over the last 2 or 3 months has been injecting cash back into the system through their repo activities, which means the fight for deposits that was pretty intense is letting up somewhat as cash comes back into the system. And I'm not exactly sure how that's going to play out.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And just taking a step back, is there a difference in terms of stickiness in terms of the deposits that you raise through, let's say, a high yield savings account versus a checking account that you are offering a cash incentive to open?","William Demchak","So the national deposits have been much more sticky than we expected because, at least as an individual, Erika, I kind of assume that unless you converted it to a full-time account, which we've had some success at doing, I assume people would shop those rates and move. We actually haven't seen that be the case, even though we have dropped -- we were pretty far below the competitive band on what we're offering. Now I'm sure there's elasticity to that. But thus far, we haven't seen much movement. The upfront money on checking accounts, which all of us do, where you open the account and you swipe your debit card five times and so forth,","Robert Reilly","A couple hundred bucks.","William Demchak","There's a lot of mischief in that. So we've had the percentage of people who basically are taking the cash going through the motions and never using the account, have made that option less attractive to us than some other things we're doing.","Erika Najarian","Oh, that's interesting. Okay.","Robert Reilly","But I would say -- I would just add to that the deposits -- as we worked rates down across the board, deposits have been stickier than what we would have expected.","William Demchak","Yes. And you see it in the numbers.","Robert Reilly","Yes.","William Demchak","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.","Robert Siefers","I just wanted to ask on the $1 billion supplemental authorization, was definitely glad to see that. But just in terms of how you came up with the $1 billion. I imagine it ended up, given the timing in the CCAR cycle being as much art as science. But just given where you sort of fleshed out, what does it say about, sort of, dry powder for the next cycle and\/or other preferences for capital use at this point?","William Demchak","I mean Rob can jump in here. But the -- as we -- as I mentioned at the Goldman Conference, the ask that we put in, had nothing to do with tailoring. So it was basically capital that we had in excess from '19 independent of rule change. As to the amount, beyond the fact that $1 billion is a nice round number, you have to remember that our existing program is a pretty big program.","Robert Siefers","Yes.","William Demchak","So adding to our existing program by much more than we asked for just didn't seem to make a lot of sense.","Robert Siefers","Okay. All right. That sounds good.","Robert Reilly","That was the art of it rather than the science of it. Yes.","Robert Siefers","Yes. Fair enough. Fair enough. And then just separately, I guess I can, sort of, back into it, but Bill, I think you had noted back in, I think, it was December when you, sort of, switched the NII outlook for 2020, given the changing ROIC profile and had suggested maybe up 1% in 2020.","Robert Reilly","Yes.","Robert Siefers","I imagine that, that still holds true. But any update on how you're thinking there?","Robert Reilly","Yes.","Robert Siefers","And then just overall balance, which becomes more self-explanatory between NII and fees as the year progresses.","Robert Reilly","Yes. No, I think it still holds. What's helping us there is we are forecasting pretty good loan growth for 2020. Our pipelines look good. So when we do that, we see up approximately 1% is achievable.","Robert Siefers","Okay. Perfect. And then maybe main fee drivers as you see them for the year?","Robert Reilly","Well, I think on the fees, we're in good shape. We -- and our fee businesses are big. They're all growing. So I think we'll see a consistent trajectory that we've seen in 2019. Just going through the broad categories, asset management. Asset management, BlackRock -- the component -- the BlackRock component, they'll do what they do. The P&C component will have a little bit of -- we'll have same-store sales growth will have a little bit of a challenge in 2019 numbers because we divested those businesses, and in fact, sold some revenue. But corporate services, consumer services, we see staying on the trajectory that they've been on. Residential mortgage could be off a little bit, but that's pretty small for us. And then service charges on deposit we see as being kind of flat because -- we'll see more client activity. But as I mentioned in my comments, we are working toward eliminating a lot of those nuances that our customers have experienced, and we want to get ahead of that. So that'll kind of offset one another. So fees are good.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.","John McDonald","Two follow-ups. In terms of consumer lending, I know you have a long-term goal to remix towards a little bit higher contribution from consumer lending. Does the CECL or the experience dipping your toe in the auto and card that you mentioned in some of the lower spectrum. Does either of those change your appetite or the degree to which you might be growing consumer loans?","William Demchak","No. I would -- I mean a couple of comments. The issue we had by going a little bit down our risk bucket. By the way, that's not a huge amount, it's kind of flowing through. I -- our team is supposed to do that, test and learn and see. We learned. We didn't like it. We move on. But we're growing independent of that if you just look at the balances that we've grown in card, in auto and in resi and even home equity, I guess, has grew...","Robert Reilly","First time. First time in a while.","William Demchak","Yes. They're executing really well, and that'll continue. The issue for CECL, of course is -- in today's environment, it's an easier answer to say, yes, we'll keep growing home equity and resi on the balance sheet because the loss rates, the loss content is so low even in the CECL reserve. The challenge will be in a more pressed economy and environment where charge-offs and losses are higher. Will you be booking loans that effectively cause negative income in the year you booked them in? That's a discussion we'll have at that period of time. I do think, as I've always said that CECL in general will hurt consumer lending, particularly when it's needed most as people pull back because of the financial pain from the reserves. But in today's environment, I don't see.","Robert Reilly","Yes. And to your question, John, we have no change in terms of our strategies for growth because of CECL.","John McDonald","Yes. Great. And the experience like you had, you're just fine-tuning where you're targeting based on the experience of what you had last year?","Robert Reilly","Yes.","William Demchak","That's right.","Robert Reilly","Yes. That's right.","John McDonald","Okay. And then in terms of the CET1 that you ultimately target. The tailoring affect how you think about what you should run at over time? Have you made any kind of fine-tuning on that? And just, kind of, remind us that target range, Rob?","Robert Reilly","Yes. Sure. So tailoring is obviously going to add some flexibility to our capital ratios. In terms of tailoring alone, we see our capital -- CET1 ratio going up about 60 bps. That's including opting out of AOCI, which hurts by about 20 basis points. And then with CECL, CECL affect CET1. That's another 19, 20 basis points. So net-net-net, tailoring CECL, we see our capital ratio going up about 40%. That's where we are today. So that adds a lot of flexibility -- basis points. I'm sorry, 40 basis points, 9.9-ish. From 9.5 to 9.9-ish. So that's a lot of flexibility. We talked about a target in the 8% to 8.5% range. So yes, we've got room.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you guys give us some color -- I jumped on the call late, so I apologize if you touched on this. Rob, you mentioned the outlook for loan growth this year is actually one of the better numbers that we've heard from your peers.","Robert Reilly","Yes.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you share with us, some of your peers have told us that there seemed to be a change in business confidence, if you will, or sentiment in the fourth quarter with these trade deals looking like they're coming together. Can you guys share with us what your customers are telling -- your commercial customers are telling you about how they feel about business for 2020.","William Demchak","Well, as it relates to trade, I think there's a lot of wait and see as to what's really there and how it impacts people. So I don't know that people have really changed. They've been -- and you've seen it in manufacturing and CapEx, they've been a bit on the sidelines. Eventually, they're going to have to spend, simply replace dated stuff. But I don't know that we've seen that yet. Our growth on the C&I side continues to come from specialty businesses and our geographic expansion. And probably one of the things that makes us a bit of an outlier just in terms of growth is once we turn consumer-positive, which we've done, the totality that the loan book is growing, and we haven't had that in the past. Yes.","Robert Reilly","Yes. In the past, here. Yes, that's right. And it's pretty balanced in terms of our outlook. And the pipelines look good.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. In fact, that was going to be my second question, Bill. Can you guys kind of share with us how much of the projected growth over what you think you'll see in 2020 is coming from your existing footprint versus what's coming from these new markets that you've been penetrated?","William Demchak","They've seen that statistic. I don't remember if you have...","Robert Reilly","Well, I mean, the new markets are accretive to our loan growth in terms of percentages, but they're working off pretty small bases.","William Demchak","They are a healthy percentage of our growth.","Robert Reilly","Yes.","William Demchak","Far outpacing the legacy books and they add -- I'm not going to guess a percentage, but I've seen it. They add to the total for sure.","Robert Reilly","They do. No question.","William Demchak","Yes.","Gerard Cassidy","And I guess, lastly on the -- other than you guys being handsome good guys, what's getting -- how are you guys winning these customers in these new markets? Is it just better products that you have that the -- that your competitors don't have for the customers that you're targeting?","William Demchak","It's a number of factors that start with really good people. It includes bringing to our new markets. Our -- the totality of PNC with a regional president model, with our community involvement, and yes, it's dependent on our products. We show up in a market, we get embedded in the community and centers of influence. We go in with our foundation and growth rate. We pick the clients we want to cover and bank long term, and we're very patient. We will call on them for 2 and 3 years. But -- before we get a shot on goal. And when we get that, our products are very good, particularly in comparison to some of the smaller in-market players. We've been doing this going all the way back to the RBC acquisition, and it works. We use the same playbook in each market that we go into. We talk about breaking even inside of three years. We've been able to do that with all the vintages and we'll keep going.","Robert Reilly","Yes. And Gerrad, I would just add to that. Not to say that for this. This is just great receptivity of these corporate clients and prospects for the P&C calling effort. And once that dialogue goes, as Bill said -- and we compete well.","William Demchak","The other thing that I would just remind you, and this is important. The potential criticism that somehow we are out just participating in other loans is not at all accurate. When you look at our cross-sell rates in those markets, they're pushing 50% fees of total revenue, which is not wildly off what we do in our legacy markets.","Robert Reilly","And signifies a relationship rather than just purchasing loans.","William Demchak","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth Usdin","Just a question on the expense side. Rob, we heard you say that you're, kind of, re-upping the $300 million CIP.","Robert Reilly","Yes.","Kenneth Usdin","And also kind of continuing to move that overall expense growth down to flattish, right?","Robert Reilly","Yes.","Kenneth Usdin","Which is a nice change over the last couple of years. And I'm just wondering underneath that, are some other things also starting to taper down in terms of -- I wouldn't dare say that you guys are changing your investment pace, but what else is helping underneath the surface, kind of, clamp down on that overall rate of expense growth that gets you closer to flattish?","Robert Reilly","Well, sure. I mean it is that. No, we're not backing off of our investments or anything along those lines. We just think that the continuous improvement program that we have in place is the strength of the company that we can achieve. In essence, 3% cost savings to fund these investments on an annual basis. And that's something that we've been very good at, and that will continue. So I don't think there's a whole lot that's changing under that.","Kenneth Usdin","Okay. Got it. And then just one more follow up on the, kind of, balance sheet mix sense. So you mentioned that the low rate environment doesn't have a lot of...","Robert Reilly","Yes.","Kenneth Usdin","Right now, interest in the securities portfolio, right? So you're growing loans a lot, which -- and you're able to pay down wholesale debt. So does the mix of earning assets continue to push more towards higher-yielding loans, and you just kind of keep the portfolio in check. How do you balance the left side of the balance sheet?","Robert Reilly","A little bit, but -- that's a little bit in that direction, but it's not that dramatic.","William Demchak","Yes. I mean at the end of the day -- we are underinvested today. We're certainly going to invest. Runoff will probably grow. One of the things going on in the background here is on the receive fixed swap side because the curve steepened out while we had largely gotten out of or lowered our position. We're back into that. So you can't just look at the securities book in terms of the way we're actually investing against the yield curve. You can think about it in terms of cash, but it's not necessarily the sole tool used to manage the balance sheet.","Kenneth Usdin","Okay. And that means that you're back into it, meaning that you're more protected against lower from here, right? Given those -- getting back into it?","William Demchak","Yes.","Robert Reilly","Yes.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew O'Connor","So obviously a lot of commentary just on the strong capital and you generate a lot of capital. Just as we think about like various uses of that capital buybacks, dividends? Maybe you could talk about some of other potential uses? I mean, really been pretty clear how you feel on bank deals, but what about loan portfolios? We've seen some branch divestitures from other people doing deals, acquiring technology, fee deal opportunities, just kind of the whole portfolio of options.","William Demchak","I mean it's a fair question. And you should assume that we look at loan portfolios. We continue to do so. We look at a lot of stuff. We look at product add-ons, and you've seen us do that in small size in terms of capabilities in the C&I space, things we would do in retail. And we'll continue to be rational actors in terms of how we spend the capital. We have been pretty clear on our thoughts on depository institutions, and that hasn't really changed. So we'll let this play out. It's nice. If you think about the environment that we are going into, notwithstanding the strength of the economy. The volatility of, kind of, what comes in an election year, I think having a lot of capital and being able to generate a lot of capital is a really good thing, simply because of the opportunities that are likely to present themselves here.","Matthew O'Connor","And then just long term, I mean, you've talked about trying to boost growth on the consumer side. And obviously, over the years, there've been either asset generators available or big credit card portfolios, and you haven't done any of those. But if you look out kind of next 5-plus years, I mean, it does seem like that could be an opportunity for you. You've got all these deposits. I know you're not a huge fan of holding a ton of securities, if there's other options, but any change in thinking of that? Again, like looking out long term, maybe now is not the right time in the cycle, but that is how -- one big difference between your balance sheet and say, USPs and [indiscernible]","William Demchak","Yes. Look, you never say never. But my experience is the consumer asset generators that come up for sale are broken, number one. And number two, we aren't the house to fix them, right? We are a prime lender in consumer that's focused on customer experience. We aren't a subprime lender, which typically, most of these people play in. We don't understand it. We don't want to be that person. The fact that if they're for sale, they blew up, they didn't understand it either suggests to me that all else equal, you won't see us -- you won't ever see us do that. Now you never say never, but that is my likely guess.","Matthew O'Connor","We said that for some time. That's not the deal view.","William Demchak","Yes. The flip side of that, by the way, on the C&I side, we're really good at fixing busted C&I, right? So big portfolios that are troubled or lenders that are troubled show up with big portfolios. That is something we pursue. That's in our wheelhouse.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez","A question on provisioning and CECL. So your -- I think your reserve ratio is about -- I think, ended the quarter at about 1.15% or 1.16%, I think. And with CECL that on January 1, that gets trued up -- show up in the first quarter results, but it will get trued up based on the fourth quarter to 1.4%. As I think about provisioning going forward and some of the dynamics around that reserve ratio, how do I think about growth and sort of the marginal growth of your portfolio versus that 1.4%. Are you growing in loans that have materially high -- on average, have materially higher loss content than 1.4%? And how do we think about that mix change in terms of how to think about provisioning versus charge-offs in ALLL ratio evolution.","William Demchak","You'll drive yourself insane. I mean I can tell you, think through all...","Saul Martinez","All else equal.","Robert Reilly","Yes. right. Yes.","William Demchak","And the issue is if we grow to the -- in the same categories today, you wouldn't necessarily have the same loss content because, for example, we shut off the lower FICO score consumer. If we shift to secured products in C&I versus unsecured products, it shifts. Before we do more card than we do resi mortgage, it's -- this thing is going to be really hard to predict. And what we have to do and we will do is give you an effect a provision attribution each quarter so that you understand it clearly, where it's coming.","Robert Reilly","The quarterly disclosures, yes, which is part of the disclosures. That's right.","Saul Martinez","Right. And look, I think the loss content...","Robert Reilly","I think remember as we have more reserves right here at day one so you are deploying in terms...","William Demchak","So the 1.40% is now going to 1%.","Robert Reilly","Yes. We've got a lot of reserves.","Saul Martinez","Got it. No. Fair. But like to the extent mix is changing, and there's no change in your strategy and the trajectory, which has seen auto, cards grow disproportionately, albeit from a lower base, I would think that if that trend continues, your loss content and your expected losses over time, assuming all else equal, which I know is unrealistic, I mean shouldn't we assume that your ALLL ratio, given current trends, should move higher from here?","William Demchak","The challenge with that is the assumption that the absolute growth in consumer will somehow keep pace with the absolute growth in C&I, which it won't, simply because C&I is disproportionately larger. So yes, consumer will grow, but you've got to remember that, that's balanced by a larger C&I book growing just as fast.","Robert Reilly","Right. That's right.","Saul Martinez","Right. So the balance growth is much bigger just from -- Okay. Got it, makes sense.","William Demchak","Yes.","Operator","There are no further questions.","William Demchak","All right. Well, thank you, everybody, and we'll see you in the first quarter.","Robert Reilly","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The PNC Financial Services Group Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bill Callihan. Sir, please go right ahead.","William H. Callihan","Good morning. And thank you, everyone, for joining our call. Participating on this call is -- are PNC's President, Bill Demchak. As many of you know, Bill will be elected CEO at our annual meeting later this month. Also on this call is Rick Johnson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Actual results and future events could differ possibly materially from those anticipated in our statements and from our historical performance due to a variety of risks and other factors. Our forward-looking statements regarding PNC's performance assume a continuation of the current economic environment and do not take into account the impact of potential legal and regulatory contingencies. Information about such factors, as well as GAAP reconciliation and other information on non-GAAP financial measures we discuss, is included in today's conference call, earnings release and related presentation materials and in our 10-K and various other SEC filings and investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under the Investor Relations sections. These statements speak only as of April 17, 2013, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Demchak.","William S. Demchak","Thanks, Bill. And good morning, everybody. I will open today with some brief thoughts about the first quarter and progress that we're making against our strategic priorities, then I'll turn it over to Rick to run you through the results. And then we'll take your questions at the end.","Rick reminded me that it's been about 8 years since I last joined you on this call, and I am thrilled to be back. And I'm honored and excited to be stepping into the role of CEO at PNC later this month. Jim obviously guided PNC through not only an historic economic crisis, but at the same time, he led us through some of the most rapid growth in our company's history. And I would tell you that I am grateful, and I know we are all grateful, for his friendship and his leadership.","Turning to this morning's announcement. We had a great first quarter. We reported first quarter net income of $1 billion or $1.76 per diluted common share, with a return on average assets of 1.34%. Our diversified businesses delivered solid revenue despite what was frankly weaker lending in the quarter. It was slower than what we saw in the fourth quarter when businesses were rushing to get deals booked before new tax rates could take effect. Having said that, we still grew loans. It just wasn't at the pace that we saw in the fourth quarter. And it remains to be seen, as we go forward, whether the slower first quarter activity is simply seasonal or a reflection of what the market is going to look like for the year ahead.","Now let me jump to our strategic priorities and just give you a quick update of where things are headed here. We are -- we continue to make good progress towards our goal of building a leading financial services franchise in the Southeast. It's been just over a year since we closed RBC. And from what we've seen today, we feel pretty good about our decision to expand in the Southeast. While it's still early in the game, I can tell you that \"out of the gate\" activity is good and it's better than we expected across all of the businesses' end markets. Our brand recognition across the Southeast has nearly doubled from 28% before the RBC Bank conversion to more than 50% today. Our teams in wealth and C&IB are largely in place, and our focus has moved from integration to winning and building new relationships. To give you an idea, in the first quarter in the Southeast, we added 9,000 new DDA households in retail, 76 new primary wealth clients, which may not sound like a lot, but you've got to remember, we didn't have a single wealth employee in the South -- Southeast a year ago. We also added 144 new primary clients in the corporate bank. And our Southeast loan book in the corporate bank grew at nearly a 20% annualized rate in the first quarter despite continued runoff in the noncore loans that we acquired. Clearly, this is a lot faster than what we're seeing in PNC's legacy markets.","All that said, we're not underestimating the challenges of this expansion and the time and the patience that it's going to take to get it right. We'll update you as we go forward on our progress in the Southeast, but we're certainly encouraged by the early wins and encouraged by the markets' receptivity to PNC.","In our wealth business, AMG, we also had a terrific first quarter, accelerating the pace of new client -- new primary client acquisition by more than 50% year-over-year. You've heard us repeatedly talk about our efforts to capture more of our clients' investable assets, and our investing in retirement cross-sell effort is really gaining traction. AMG cross-sell revenues from retail and C&IB increased by more than 20% linked quarter and 70% year-over-year. AMG also achieved all-time-high assets under administration of $236 billion and assets under management of $118 billion.","Mortgage business also had a good first quarter, though, I would tell you, our origination performance didn't meet our expectations. Origination volumes for the industry were obviously down. And while our volumes remained essentially flat, stable, we were expecting growth given the momentum that we'd carried into the end of last year, and we didn't see that. It is worth noting, though, that there were no surprises on repurchase reserves, and we do like our sales momentum.","In retail, we've talked with you lately about our work to leverage new distribution and transaction channels that better align with our customers' preferences while at the same time lowering our cost to serve. And while it's still early, I'm pleased with the progress we're making. To give you an idea, in Southwestern Pennsylvania, this is our first market to be fully outfitted with the new image-enabled ATMs, and there, we see consumer teller deposits are down 17% if you go Feb to Feb and despite a 2.25% growth in actual customers. So a big change.","At the same time, we've been pretty public about our plans to close up to 200 branches and to open others where it makes sense to do so. We actually added customers this quarter while closing 30 branches in the first quarter. If we look at corporate-wide expenses and recognizing the environment that we're in, I'm very pleased with the commitment of our senior management team and managers throughout the organization to disciplined expense management. PNC has long been good at continuous improvement, but it's a new environment. And throughout the organization, there's a new attitude about expenses and a realization that we still have room for improvement. And while we might not be able to maintain quite the pace we set in the first quarter, we are in an excellent position to achieve our expense management goals for the year. And that's probably a good place for me to turn it over to Rick.","Richard J. Johnson","Thank you, Bill, and welcome back. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin with our balance sheet on Slide 4.","Total assets declined by $4.3 billion or 1.4% on a linked quarter basis as we reduced cash on deposits with the Federal Reserve and we did not replace prepayments on our securities portfolio. In addition, loan growth slowed in the first quarter as spot loan balances increased $650 million compared to year end. In the first quarter, we have seen more transactions move to the capital markets and away from bank balance sheets. It remains to be seen if this is an aberration or a trend, although we did see some modest improvements in our pipeline in March and early April.","Commercial loan growth was the driver of our increase in total loans. Total commercial lending increased by $1.4 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2012 as a result of specialty lending businesses, including public finance, asset-based lending and commercial real estate. Consumer loans declined in the first quarter primarily due to paydowns of residential real estate, credit card and education loans.","First quarter transaction deposits decreased by approximately $1.3 billion on a spot basis compared to the fourth quarter primarily due to the seasonally high year-end corporate deposits, which exited the bank in the first week of January. However, on an average basis, first quarter transaction deposits grew by $3.1 billion on a linked quarter basis, reflecting our growth in customers and their liquidity.","Shareholders' equity increased by $660 million or approximately 2% in the first quarter primarily due to retained earnings. As a result, we ended the first quarter with strong capital ratios. Our Tier 1 common ratio at the end of the first quarter is estimated to be 9.8%. That's up 20 basis points since the end of the fourth quarter. Our Basel III Tier 1 pro forma common capital ratio was estimated to be 7.9% as of March 31, 2013, without the benefit of phases. This reflects growth in retained earnings and a reduction in risk-weighted assets. The reduction in risk-weighted assets can be attributed to enhanced modeling processes and greater clarity regarding the rules. We will continue to enhance our process and estimates, as we entered parallel run in January 1 of this year. However, at this level, we have narrowed the gap and are close to the lower end of our operating range for Basel III. We continue to believe we will be well positioned to return additional capital to shareholders in 2014.","Now turning to our income statement on Slide 5. We produced nearly $4 billion in revenue in the first quarter, and expenses of $2.4 billion were better than planned. This resulted in pretax pre-provision earnings of approximately $1.6 billion, an increase of 26% compared to the fourth quarter of last year and 22% compared to the same quarter a year ago.","Now overall credit trends remained positive. Consistent with our guidance, our provision for the first quarter was $236 million, which was down $82 million from the fourth quarter of last year as a result of overall credit quality improvement. And you will recall, our provision in the fourth quarter was $318 million, which includes $53 million due to the implementation of regulatory guidance for loans discharged from bankruptcy. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect the provision to remain between $200 million and $300 million.","Overall, this quarter resulted in $1 billion in net income and $1.76 per diluted common share. Our return on average assets for the quarter were 1.34%, an increase of 39 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of last year.","Overall, these are great results to start the year, but as I will explain further, this level of earnings may not be sustainable in this challenging environment.","Let me take a moment to discuss the impact of loan growth on our net interest income, on Slide 6. Average interest-earning assets increased by $2.5 billion on a linked quarter basis due to average loan growth of approximately $2.9 billion or 1.6%. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, average interest-earning assets were up $18 billion or 8% as a result of a $21.5 billion or a 13% increase in average loans.","Now comparing the first quarter to the fourth, core net interest income remained stable, while scheduled purchase accounting accretion decreased, as expected. However, cash recoveries on impaired commercial loans remained stable, resulting in a less-than-2% decline in net interest income, better than expected. When comparing to the prior year quarter, net interest income increased $98 million or 4% primarily due to a 6% growth in core net interest income due to loan growth and a stable net interest margin. As you can see from the graph on Slide 6, overall net interest margin contracted by 4 basis points on a linked quarter basis, while core margin held steady at 3.43%.","Now looking to the second quarter, we're once again expecting a 2% to 3% decline in net interest income compared to the first quarter due to a decrease in scheduled purchase accounting accretion and lower expected cash recoveries. For the full year, we now expect purchase accounting accretion to decline by approximately $350 million versus 2012, while core net interest income is expected to increase modestly from 2012 to 2013.","And as you can see on Slide 7, total noninterest income declined by $79 million or 5% in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter results. When you adjust for the provision for residential mortgage repurchase obligations and a fourth quarter gain on the sale of Visa shares, noninterest income declined even further. This decrease is driven by a reduction of almost $100 million in revenue on capital market activities such as M&A, loan syndications and customer derivative activities. The fourth quarter performance in capital markets was exceptionally strong, and lower-than-expected lending activity in the first quarter contributed to the quarter-to-quarter decline.","Residential Mortgage Banking revenue also declined, primarily due to lower loan sales revenue, below our expectations, partially offset by higher net hedging gains on mortgage servicing rights. On the other hand, we had steady growth in asset management and consumer service fee categories. The diversification of our businesses resulted in noninterest income-to-total revenue remaining steady at 40% in the first quarter.","Total noninterest income increased $125 million or 9% from a year ago due to a $114 million or 10% increase in fee income, primarily driven by gains in corporate, consumer and deposit services and asset management fees. This year-to-year comparison reflects progress we have achieved in customer growth and in our efforts to deepen customer relationships. We continue to expect that full year total reported revenue will increase in 2013 compared to 2012.","Now turning to Slide 8. First quarter expenses decreased by $434 million as every category declined on a linked quarter basis. This performance clearly exceeded our expectations. The decline included lower expenses related to selected items such as lower residential mortgage foreclosure-related expenses and no charges related to trust preferred securities redemptions, goodwill impairments or integrations. We also saw lower marketing costs and reduced incentive compensation expenses primarily related to lower capital market activities.","As I've said before, we are looking to achieve a total of $700 million in cost savings. These dollars are being used to offset investments we're making in our businesses and infrastructure. Through the end of the first quarter, we have captured approximately $500 million of annualized savings. This gives us confidence that we will meet our full year cost savings target.","Comparing first quarter to the same period a year ago, noninterest expenses were down $60 million or 2%, reflecting prior year integration costs and the benefits of our continuous improvement efforts, offset by investments we've made in our strategic priorities, including the full quarter impact of RBC Bank expenses.","For the second quarter, we currently expect noninterest expenses to be 2% to 3% higher than the first quarter due to an expected increase in marketing expenses and up to $48 million in noncash charges from calling trust preferred securities. On a full year basis, I continue to expect reported expenses to decline by mid single digits on a percentage basis, while I now expect core expenses, which exclude integration and trust preferred securities redemption charges, to be flat to down in 2013 versus 2012 due to our strong first quarter performance.","Turning to credit quality on Slide 9. Credit trends in the first quarter were impacted as we aligned our regulatory guidance that had the overall effect of increasing charge-offs by $134 million and nonperforming loans by $426 million by reducing reported delinquencies by $395 million. This included adoption of a policy to classify performing second-lien consumer loans as nonperforming when the first lien is 90 days or more past due. While our credit metrics were impacted by this, underlying credit quality continued to improve in the first quarter.","Overall, PNC posted strong financial results in the first quarter. Looking ahead, certain first quarter results may not be sustainable in the current environment. For the second quarter, we expect the following: Spotted loan growth but at a slower pace than we had experienced in 2012. We expect net interest income to decline by approximately 2% to 3% compared to the first quarter due to a decrease in purchase accounting accretion. We believe expenses will increase by approximately 2% to 3% in the second quarter over the first quarter. The provision should be in the range of $200 million to $300 million. Finally, we expect continued progress towards the achievement of our full year capital goals.","Taken together, this was a very good quarter for PNC, providing us with a strong foundation for future growth. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.","William H. Callihan","Operator, if you could give our participants the instructions, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll proceed with our next -- our first question. It is from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question is just on some clarification on your guidance, Rick. On the expense side, you're now looking for core expenses to be flat to down. Could you give us a sense at which -- what base you're using for core for 2012? And I'm getting a base of about $9.9 billion. Is that a correct base?","Richard J. Johnson","No, I think -- no, that's very well done. That's exactly right, Erika. I would look at it as 9.9. It's down from the 10 we gave you before because we had a beat of about $100 million in the first quarter.","Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it, okay. And just my second question is more on capital deployment priorities. Rick, I appreciate your comments that you are looking to return additional capital to shareholders in 2014. And just to turn this question to Bill, clearly, you are already a rounding error away from the low end of your range in terms of your Basel III goals, building goals for the year. Could you give us a sense of what your capital deployment priorities are going to be for 2014?","William S. Demchak","Sure. First and foremost, and we'll say this every time you ask, we'll focus our capital on client activity and growth and good-quality loans where we're getting a return. But beyond that, we will have a focus on continued dividend return and increases in dividend and then, importantly, meaningful share buyback, which we've been out of the market for a couple of years, but in '14, we've been pretty vocal that we should have capacity, and we'll execute on that. It's -- beyond that, if -- I'll get the question at some point as to whether or not there's small banks we want to buy, so why don't we tackle that? That would be pretty far down the list right now given the bet we already have in the Southeast that we need to execute on and the price expectations we see from some of the smaller banks.","Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So is the message there, is there any large foreign-owned institutions that would be for sale in your footprint that would absolutely not be on your priority list?","William S. Demchak","My statement was pretty clear. We have a lot on our plate and a lot that we can do organically, and we're going to focus on that and execute on it. And we've been doing just that. We feel pretty good about it. We feel good about capital return to shareholders in '14.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Paul Miller with FBR.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Yes, on the mortgage banking front, you made a couple of comments about that your production was a little bit lower than you had thought because of the momentum you had going into the first quarter. Can you add a little color to that? And also on your gain on sale margins, which have held up pretty -- it was down from, I think, 4.80% to 4%. Could you give us a little guidance on where you think that -- those things are going to go in the quarter or 2?","William S. Demchak","Yes. It's Bill. I'll take the front end of it. I mean, the momentum comment is simply that we grew originations quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter straight through last year as we added capacity. And we felt pretty good about our ability to extend that even though we had expected industry volume to decline. We managed to hold it flat, but we didn't manage to extend it as competition for people, frankly, got pretty fierce and our ability to have the hedge we expected just wasn't there. Rick can tackle off the margin question.","Richard J. Johnson","Yes. The spread declined by about 16%. It was previously about 4.90%. We ended up this quarter about 4.10% in terms of the margin. So that was what we were expecting. I think what we didn't expect was the lower volume levels. For the year, we're looking at probably about a 3.50% average margin on this activity, but we'll have to watch that and see how that plays out.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And I know HARP loans played a pretty decent part of your production last quarter -- I mean, last year. Have you -- I mean, is that going down in percentages, and do you expect that? I mean, what do you expect that to pan out over the year?","Richard J. Johnson","Well, we ended about 30%. And I -- we don't really see much of a change, I mean, with the extension. We just continue to focus on the activity we have. We're not expecting any big change in the percentage.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Because a lot are even talking about burnouts. Some of the bigger shops thought that most of their HARP loans have burned out. But do you think you still got plenty of HARP stuff in your portfolio?","William S. Demchak","Part of -- you've got to remember, a big chunk of our focus has been on purchase loans. And through the course of last year, we actually didn't focus very aggressively at all on refinance even within our own portfolio because we want to build that purchase franchise. So we may have a slightly different circumstance than some of the bigger guys.","Operator","And we'll proceed to our next question. It's from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a follow-up on some of the expense comments earlier. I guess, if you're already at a $500 million run rate in the first quarter and you're targeting $700 million by the end of the year -- I think you've talked about closing another roughly 150 branches throughout this year, and I'd imagine there are some other back-office areas that are being addressed as well. So I guess, why won't we be at a higher run rate by the end of the year than the $700 million?","Richard J. Johnson","Well, you're naturally going to be at a higher run rate. Given -- keep in mind, that's an annualized number, so it really means we saved $125 million in the first quarter, which will repeat through the other 3 quarters. So that's your $500 million. And the reason why you're there is you've got the momentum of the initiatives you had in the prior year, so they get the full year impact into the first quarter, you see that immediately. Second thing is we got a big benefit of almost $25 million in the first quarter on mortgage foreclosure, $25 million for the quarter and $100 million for the year. So the fourth -- it's going to be harder sledding to increase that number for the rest of the year, but we should easily get it to $700 million.","William S. Demchak","Yes. I mean, the one comment I'd make, Matt, we won't declare victory at $700 million. So we're going to get as much as we can get out of the company here and stay focused on it. That's just kind of the number we have out there right now, but it's not a stepping-stone goal.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then I guess, on the flipside, in the last couple of years, you've talked about some continuous improvement costs but then a lot of it being reinvested. And this year, you've obviously said there will be less reinvestment versus the savings. But just as we think about the pace of reinvestment throughout this year and beyond, are you getting to a point where your -- it'll be meaningfully less? Or is it going to continue at that kind of $500 million range?","William S. Demchak","It's hard to look out very far. I mean, remember, in the last year, in particular, as we've built out the Southeast, we had a lot of investment in people, in facilities, that cost last year in particular. Now we carry those -- that run rate forward, so it'd be higher than it otherwise might be. We also, through time, and will continue to spend on risk management initiatives as it relates to Basel II and CCAR and core infrastructure, but I don't know that we'd see that accelerating.","Richard J. Johnson","No, no. Matt, the only thing I'd mention, if you recall, when we talked about the full year $700 million, we had $550 million being invested, $150 for unidentified items at the moment, but we didn't need that portion of the $150 million in the first quarter. So we still have that $150 million in our full year forecast.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. I guess what I'm just trying to figure at is -- I mean, it seems like, this year, the core costs, I mean, you said flat to down, so maybe there's a downward bias this year. I'm just trying to figure out if we'll see net expense reductions again this year and next year if the revenue environment remains challenging. That's what I'm trying to get at.","William S. Demchak","Well, if the revenue environment stays challenging, and I expect it will. You're going to see us continue to focus on it. We'll see what the end result of that is. But beyond kind of the comments we've got out, that Rick's put out there, on the $700 million and the flat to down, that's probably the best we can forecast at this point.","Richard J. Johnson","Yes. And I think, Matt, that we positioned ourselves well for '14 by keeping expenses pretty flat throughout the year, whereas in prior years, we had an increase in expenses through the year, and that automatically put you at a higher level. So we're -- we can't give guidance on '14, but we're clearly positioning ourselves for the right actions.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Keith Murray with Nomura.","Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Can we spend a minute on Basel III?","William S. Demchak","Sure.","Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Would you guys be willing to give us a Basel III risk-weighted asset number?","Richard J. Johnson","We haven't disclosed that yet. And we've just chosen not to simply because we're just entering the parallel run January 1. So we've just chosen -- we've given you the ratio, we're going to continue to monitor that and continue to grow it. And I think, as we get more and more comfortable with modeling and some of the other conservative estimates we've made in the calculation, then I -- we'll put it out at some point in the future.","Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And you mentioned the benefit from enhanced modeling this quarter. Do you see opportunities for further RWA mitigation?","Richard J. Johnson","Well, it can go both ways. I think that's what we got to be careful, but I think I'm hopeful that we've been more conservative than not. And obviously, it's -- part of this, by the way, isn't just better modeling and so on, it's also the rules are changing. And we have the market risk rule, you have the securitization rules, and we refined our modeling on that. So you had a number of items that we were able to refine this quarter to improve the risk-weighted asset number.","William S. Demchak","Yes. But you have to go back and remember that we became a Basel II-mandatory bank much later than most of the other people who had to report it. So in our own internal numbers, certainly early on, our variance around our estimate was probably wider than we would've liked, which is why it took us a while to disclose it. Through time, we're just kind of narrowing the variance on that expectation. But Rick's right: It -- we'd like to think that we're still conservative, but it can move both ways.","Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And then just switching to loan pricing and competition. Are there particular areas, whether it's auto or commercial, that you're really seeing, whether it's terms or pricing, issues that concern you?","William S. Demchak","We could just answer yes to all of the above. A couple of sound bites: In the smaller balanced stuff, so think this as banking and commercial, it's interesting, the spread compression on new stuff has largely kind of stopped. I mean, it's down a couple quarter-to-quarter. And what we're seeing is actually extension in terms and weakening structures to why we're losing deals on the small side where guys are going out 10 years now. You've seen it on indirect auto, right? The banks have been on fire and growing balances there. We grew balances pretty aggressively last year. We're reaching the point now where we're willing to give up volume here because the spread levels have kind of gotten down to the point where our returns on equity are basically at the margin. In the larger commercial side where things need to be syndicated, let's leave out leveraged loans for a second, things are -- they're tightening but structures are still same. And for these to go to a handful of banks, it's still decent value on that, still decent spreads and asset base. We've seen compression in real estate but thus far not to the point where I would be worried about it. Perhaps starting to see some of that multi-family projects that are coming on. But it's getting tight. People are chasing assets. There's no yield on securities. And they're going to chase loans, it's not a surprise. And what we do when that happens is we'll gradually change our focus from new loan balances to cross-sell and harvest all the new clients that we added over the last couple of years, which we're pretty good at.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ian Foley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Guys, it's actually Ian Foley for Ken. Just wanted to start off at the margin. Could you kind of just walk us through the puts and takes over the next quarter and just what you have left in terms of margin-ed events over the year?","Richard J. Johnson","We've given guidance that it'll be down 2% to 3% primarily because of purchase accounting accretion...","William S. Demchak","Net interest income. Let's say cost of [ph] margin [indiscernible].","Richard J. Johnson","Yes. I'm sorry. For net interest income, we've given guidance. But we don't typically give margin guidance, so I'm not going to necessarily get into that.","Ian Foley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. But could you give some of the put -- just kind of what you have left in terms of CD repricing, debt calling, et cetera?","Richard J. Johnson","Not a lot on the CD side. I mean, obviously, all the CDs that we have priced to National City, they're gone. We finished all that repricing. You did see overall cost of funds drop during the quarter at the same time we saw on the core. At the same time, we saw the interest-earning asset margins declined. So we're able to keep the margin stable in this quarter, but we will run out of room, clearly, on the liability side at some point. And as a result, I would expect at some point, and then it continues to decline.","Ian Foley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then a quick question on the corporate services line. Just in terms of how it builds over the year, do you think that can get back over $300 million as time goes on?","Richard J. Johnson","Absolutely. I think, if you look back at the prior couple of quarters before that, we were up to $275 million, I think, in the third quarter. And I think if we'd add customers and added activity, I think we can certainly get it back up. But a lot of it is going to have an impact on how much lending goes to bank balance sheets now that affects some of the M&A activities, syndications and derivatives on the back end of that. So we'll just have to watch and see how the lending market progresses.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Coming back to the loan terms that you guys were just referring to, can you put that in contact -- context to what we saw in the '06-'07 time period versus today? Are you guys seeing terms and conditions that are as weak as they were back then? Or are they weaker compared to 2009?","William S. Demchak","It means that nothing is back to where it was on '05 on a spread or structure side. We're gradually grinding our way lower, but we're not through the threshold of where we would see, for the most part, decent -- still decent returns on credit. And there's different pockets. The very -- the commodity-like corporate loan where there's nothing special about it, one bank can take it down without syndicating it. That's where you see most of the pressure. Or a stand-alone real estate loan, CMBS market is back and putting competition into that. Where we -- the thing that we did well with all through last year and this quarter is our specialty lending activity whether it's our asset-based lending, some of the activities we have in real estate, our equipment finance activity, public finance, the securitization activity that kind of has left the capital markets, it can come back on balance sheet. Our growth is coming from those areas, which differentiates us, and not so much where we're seeing a real strong competition in the plain vanilla product. But even the plain vanilla isn't back to where it was in '05 where it just -- it got pretty silly.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The second question is regarding -- Rick, you just were talking about the corporate services. The weakness in the quarter, could you go over again why the -- it came in at $277 million versus where you were in the fourth quarter at $349 million?","Richard J. Johnson","Yes. The -- it wasn't so much the weakness in the quarter, as it was an outstanding fourth quarter. I mean, we have $70 million in the fourth quarter in M&A fees, just to give you an idea, but down to $16 million in the first quarter, so -- and typically, that might run at about 20 a quarter. So it -- marginally weaker in the first quarter, is what I would say. It was really just a very strong fourth quarter.","William S. Demchak","Yes. Fourth quarter, they -- the pipeline kind of got cleaned out as people were raising ahead to get deals done prior to the uncertainty on what was going to happen with taxes. And the one thing to remember about our derivative activity: it basically goes along with our new loan activity, right? So we're not -- we don't cover traders and hedge funds and so forth. We cover corporations, and they hedge loans. So when loan activity is robust and syndications are robust, you'll see our derivative income be the same.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then finally, can you give us some more color on the decline in the consumer lending? Was it primarily due to pricing? Or what were some of the factors there?","William S. Demchak","It's different story in each bucket. I think education lending is self-explanatory. I think, in card, we just saw less utilization as we turned the year. Some of that's seasonal. Indirect grew but at a slower pace than we saw last year. And the business banking area was kind of a wash between origination and runoff, which we'll continue to see on the acquired books. I guess some equity was more or less flat again.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So I think most of the things that I actually wanted to ask about expenses have been asked and answered. But going through the line of business stuff, I thought it was interesting, in the mortgage business, you had slightly down earnings relative to a year ago, but the capital doubled. So the return on capital was down by 2\/3. So could you talk a little bit about how you would envision that business getting to an acceptable return on capital?","William S. Demchak","We have guys scrambling through sheets here. So I'm not sure I can explain exactly what happened to the capital number. I think the challenge for mortgage, for us and everyone else, obviously is that, when the refi wave burns out, it's going to be -- and as you go towards that margin's decline, we're going to have to get expenses out of the business. Ultimately, long term, we believe that we can get a production level at an expense level that allows us to get a decent return out of that business. But for us and everyone else, it's going to be noise in between here and there as the business rightsizes when the refi wave ends. Do you have anything...","Richard J. Johnson","No.","William S. Demchak","Sorry, go ahead.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just -- yes. One other thing, kind of in a related area. We'd had some discussions in the past about asset management and the investment process that you're making and the fact that your expenses are kind of growing, at least roughly in lockstep with revenues, and some quarters have been higher. Where do you stand on that? And when can we see -- I mean, you had good numbers there but not seeing that operating leverage yet.","William S. Demchak","Yes, the breakeven on adds, and we continue to add and we'll add this year, it's running, what, Rick, 18 months on average when we bring new people into a new market. And we have history now to kind of prove that and roll forward, and we see it in our sales momentum and growth. But it's going to take a while, right? We're -- we fundamentally changed the focus we have on this business and want to materially change the size of the business. And so we've invested in people to do that. Then we've changed the folks inside the company to get the whole company to sell the product, in effect, through referrals, and we're seeing great traction on that. To be honest with you, we're really pleased with the fact that, by and large, we have been able to pay for it as we go along off of new revenue, which if you think about the number of people, I think we've added 300-plus client-facing people for the last bunch of years and managed to hold things flat. That's a pretty outstanding accomplishment.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Mike Turner with Compass Point.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Your -- just wanted to find out. I know that the new guidance on levered loans came out about 3 weeks ago, and my understanding is that the guidance wasn't really all that changed from the initial proposals a year ago. Maybe if you could comment on the impact of those new -- of that new guidance, if you've seen any, if you've been complying with it. Any color would be appreciated.","William S. Demchak","Sorry, guidance from where?","Richard J. Johnson","Yes.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","The Federal Reserve put out new guidance on levered loans. It was on March 19...","William S. Demchak","I would tell you, we play such a tiny role inside of that. It hasn't hit my radar. The loan growth that you're seeing inside this company certainly isn't coming from that space. And to the extent we had loans that kind of looked levered or higher risk, they exist in our asset-based lending book. And they aren't, in the end, because they're secured with a monitored borrowing base. So we don't really play in that space. I suspect they put it out -- I don't know what was in it, but I'm sure they put it out because we've seen some pretty frothy terms in structure and price in the levered loan market, largely on the large corporate side, which we don't play in either.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Jack Micenko from SIG.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Bill, I think, in a competitor conference a few weeks or month ago, you had expressed some confidence that mortgage trends in '13 is going to be above '12. And I think you've pointed to some improvement in processes, talked about shrinking some closing times down pretty aggressively. And then your comments today, a little bit more cautious but then you're talking about purchase, doing more in the purchase side. Do you still feel confident that '13 numbers can be above '12? Or has the recent trends changed your mind a little bit?","William S. Demchak","Trends have changed my mind a little bit. I would tell you that our production numbers ought to be above '12. You get there if you simply straight-line what we did in the first quarter, so that's not a heroic assumption. The challenge is, we see margin compression. So total revenues, it'll be a fight to get them to be flat. And so that is a change. I -- frankly, we kind of underestimated the degree of difficulty in adding mortgage originators as we got into this year. The competition for people got really hot, and we basically faded off of paying that much money for new people into the company. But it ought to be -- at the end of the day, it's going to be a good performance. It's -- and the difference isn't material to PNC. It's -- just it's a little worse than I had hoped. And yes, so I was wrong.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Fair enough. And I think, Rick, in your comments, you're talking about pipeline for C&I building in April. Is there anything -- if I heard you wrong, correct me, but if that's the case, is there any one industry or perhaps region that you can point to that is showing maybe some of that recovery in April?","Richard J. Johnson","The building I saw in March and April was of nothing in January and February. So -- but it's clearly in the specialty lending areas, as Bill mentioned before, whether that be commercial real estate, public finance, equipment leasing, commercial real estate and so on.","William S. Demchak","Yes. It's interesting that, the big guys talking about market activity, they kind of said January and February were strong and March fell off. And for us, it was just the opposite. Jan and Feb for middle market was really, well, kind of scary, it was weak. And March came back pretty strong as a sales month. And that's kind of carrying here into April but not at levels that are breaking records here.","Operator","And we'll proceed to our next question. It is from the line of Terry McEvoy with Oppenheimer.","Terence J. McEvoy - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","With the RBC deal closing over a year ago, I was wondering if you could talk about branch or customer profitability in the newer Southeast markets. I know you mentioned earlier the business wins in the first quarter, but are you starting to see higher products and servicers -- services per customer and, call it, transitioning away from what some of the critics of the deal felt was a one-product customer base?","William S. Demchak","Well, look, anecdotally, I can tell you that we're growing, as you saw, from households to corporate clients, wealth clients and through-the-door, and we're selling them more products. We don't have accurate metrics at this point as you think about the changes that are going on in that client base because we continue to run off loans that just aren't core to what we would want to hold as we grow new customers and then cross-sell their existing customers that we do on a whole. So progress is good anecdotally, and we need to work on being able to come up with better metrics longer term.","Richard J. Johnson","Yes, I think, to Bill's point, the best you can hope for in the first year of operations is to maintain the balances flat to up. And we've been able to increase our balances by about 6% in loans despite the runoff over the course of the year. So we're real pleased with that.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","First question, Bill, just going back to some of your comments on auto possibly kind of scaling back volumes in terms of as you relate it to margins, if you will. Just curious, as it relates to those volumes, any impact or how you're thinking about the recent -- the noise coming out of the consumer protection board as it relates to kind of pricing, the upfront charges within that market? Is that any impact on that?","William S. Demchak","Well, it is a concern, but they're unrelated. And in terms of -- we're basically holding the price, so that's going to cause volumes to decline, notwithstanding, I guess, March was kind of the best in 5 or 6 years in auto production. But the CFPB's look-through to dealers on disparate impact and whether or not dealers are charging unfairly the markup on top of our price, that'll have to play out. And it's something that we, in effect, are being asked to police. And so I think the whole industry is waiting to see how that plays. We, of course, try to monitor that with our dealers, but this is kind of unknown territory as to how it plays out, and we're watching.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, but for the time being, it's not really affecting how you're looking at the business itself. And again you're focused on...","William S. Demchak","Well, it affects how we choose dealers, but it always has, right? So in some ways that the CFPB kind of coming out and making this statement, I'd like to think that we were pretty good in our dealer selection that we work with through history to take that sort of thing into account.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just secondly, just in terms of credit, maybe Rick, just in terms of some of the noise with the policy changes in Q4, Q1. The provision guidance has stayed relatively consistent the last several quarters, if you will. How should we think about now in terms of the past dues obviously getting better and so forth? How do we go -- how should we think about in terms of the actual level of criticized assets, how that's trending in terms of the pace, as well as the charge-offs, on a go-forward basis after you strip out some of the noise?","Richard J. Johnson","Well, I think, you're going to continue to see improvements in the underlying credit quality statistics. And we've been running -- if you take out the unusual adjustments, around $300 million of charge-offs in the quarter, I think that'll continue to improve over time. And I believe that still puts us in that $200 million to $300 million range as we're obviously seeing a faster pace of improvement on the commercial side than we are on the consumer side and so, as a result, releasing some reserves on the commercial side. Not yet ready to release a lot of reserves on the consumer side, we still have a large pipeline of IOs and POs coming to maturity over the next 5 years or so. And I think we got to keep watching that to make sure that we keep funding our reserve levels to replenish the charge-offs that we're seeing.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Kind of curious [ph] on kind of 2 sections. One was more just technically on -- you were talking about the $1.76 and not thinking that, that would move lower as you kind of move forward. You highlighted 2 things, which was the increase in expenses related to marketing and trust preferred. You also [indiscernible] on the NII. The other thing I was wondering about was, the tax rate was a little bit lower this quarter at around 24%. In the past years, it's been around 27%. Was that another item that would kind of go on that list that was favorable this quarter?","Richard J. Johnson","No, we were expecting about 25%. And we got some isolated credits. I think we've given guidance of 25% to 26%. Got some isolated credits in the first quarter, which made us at 24%. So I think it'd go back to 25%, you're fine there. And the other thing too is, in the wording, we say \"may not be sustainable.\" We're not giving up on $1.76, but we mean, clearly with the trends of low rates on NII and further higher expenses, it'll be a challenge to keep it at that level.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And did you -- out of the 2% to 3% increase in expenses, how much of that will be related to the trust preferred expenses...","Richard J. Johnson","Well, what we did is -- the trust preferred could be anywhere from $15 million to $45 million, $48 million, somewhere in that range. And also you've got, marketing is going to go up. We expect marketing to increase anywhere from $25 million to $35 million. I think the -- take each of those, you get a range of between 2% to 3%.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then Bill, just a general question to you. As you are kind of taking the reins over now, what are the things that -- 2 or 3 things you're focused on as you begin to go through the PNC and start to create the next direction here?","William S. Demchak","So we got to execute. And we're not changing the direction we were going in. We've got to execute on the Southeast and build that out to a sustainable size and turn it into look and feel like the rest of PNC's markets. We'll continue on the wealth and investing initiative. We continue to build a sustainable and profitable mortgage business. And then long term, and this is over years and years, is the rebuild and rethink of the retail business as it relates to changing profitability, changing demographics and changing technology. We've got to get that right. And then finally, near term, the expense initiative that we have in the company as we grind our way through, what is a slower economy and low interest rates. I -- people shouldn't expect to see a change in direction of PNC beyond executing the best we have on the table today. And we're well set up to do that.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.","Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","This is -- actually, it's Jason Harbes, on for Matt. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. I just wanted to ask, as far as the loan growth that you're expecting in the second quarter, geographically, where are you seeing the greatest pockets of strength or, conversely, weakness? And also, by product, is it going to be continued C&I that's kind of leading the growth? Or is there anything -- any color you can give us there would be appreciated.","William S. Demchak","It's pretty geographically dispersed. I don't know that there's a particular region of the country that would stand out in terms of where growth is coming from. And while it's bucketed inside of C&I, the growth that we're seeing in pure C&I is really in asset-based lending, which while C&I related is kind of a specialty product and something that we've gained a lot of share and credibility in. And we've seen less growth in traditional corporate revolvers, certainly in terms of utilization, even though we've grown clients. Real estate balances, Rick, you may have a better number, but we -- because we got into the projects early 3 years ago, we will see balances grow simply through utilization increase as they finish out the projects. And we continue to see balanced growth in equipment finance, which is spread pretty much across the footprint as well.","Richard J. Johnson","Yes, I would say, spot year-end 2012 to spot year-end 2013, we're looking at mid-single-digit loan growth, which is driven primarily by the commercial side.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we do have another follow-up question from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I forgot to ask a question on issues with the regulators and the credit. Was this something new, or is this just a follow-up to what they did last year with some of the banks in terms of the second liens when the first lien is in trouble?","Richard J. Johnson","Yes, Gerard, this is a follow-up. We took the provision impact in 2012, but we were unable to operationalize the changes until the first quarter of this year in terms of the impact of charge-offs, nonperforming loans, non-accruals and all other things that have to take place for that. So yes, we're just catching up, to be honest with you.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, good. And then the second part of the question: I know you've talked, Rick, about the IOs and POs and the impact that may have on charge-offs and provisions as we go forward. Can you guys talk about the new loans both primarily consumer, I guess, on what the credit behavior has been? Because when you look at the monthly credit card delinquencies from the large issuers, the credit card delinquencies are at incredibly low levels. And then if you look at Fannie Mae's cumulative charge-off numbers and delinquencies for vintages of '09, '10, '11 and '12, they are very low. Are you guys seeing that in your new business? Not the old IO, PO stuff, but what about the new originations over the last couple of years? Are they trending better than expected on credit?","William S. Demchak","I mean, they are trending extremely well. I don't know if it's -- is it better than expected. I think it's certainly better than through cycle, which is probably true, which is what you're seeing in all the others' statistics as well. But the one place I would tell is that we're probably potentially even too conservative is in card, where we don't have enough people that revolve balances. Our people are basically paying the -- paying off their real high FICO. And we could probably tend to take a little bit more risk there than we're doing today. But the rest of it, I mean, look, I think all the consumer delinquencies at this point are kind of below cycle levels, at least as it relates to new production.","Operator","And we have no further question on the phones.","William S. Demchak","Okay, all right.","William H. Callihan","Well, listen, thank you, everybody, for joining us. And we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.","Operator","Thank you very much. And this concludes this conference call. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a good day, everyone."],"17268":["PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bryan Gill. Sir, please go ahead.","Bryan Gill","Well, thank you and good morning. Welcome to today\u2019s conference call for The PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Demchak and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today\u2019s presentation contains forward-looking information. Our forward-looking statements regarding PNC performance assume a continuation of the current economic trends and do not take into account the impact of potential legal and regulatory contingencies. Actual results and future events could differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in our statements and from historical performance due to a variety of risks and other factors.","Information about such factors, as well as GAAP reconciliations and other information on non-GAAP financial measures we discuss, is included in today\u2019s conference call, earnings release and related presentation materials and in our 10-K, 10-Q and other SEC filings and investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of July 14, 2017 and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Bill Demchak.","Bill Demchak","Thanks, Bryan and good morning, everybody. As you have seen this morning, PNC reported net income of $1.1 billion or $2.10 per diluted common share in the second quarter. You likely also saw our announcement last week regarding the dividend. Following the CCAR stress test results last month, we announced a 36% increase in our common stock dividend raising it to an all-time high of $0.75 per common share. In addition, we plan to repurchase up to $2.7 billion of PNC shares over the next four quarters, which would be a 17% increase over last year\u2019s buyback as we work to return more capital to shareholders.","As Rob is going to layout in a bit more detail, this is a pretty good quarter for us. I am particularly pleased with our loan growth this quarter, C&IB, in particular, grew 4% in the quarter, helped by the E&C equipment finance acquisition and a slight uptick in utilization, but beyond that, it was particularly impressive, because it was across the board, including the traditional commercial middle-market segments where we really haven\u2019t seen a sustained growth for several years. Expenses were in line with our guidance although there are certain categories in there that were bit higher than I would have liked and Rob is going to give you more color on this, but it was a bunch of give and takes and I assure you that we remain focused here.","As you saw, credit remained benign and fee income was up, some of it driven by seasonally higher customer activity. Obviously, we are pleased to see another interest rate increase by the fed in June and NII was up on the back of higher rates in the previously mentioned loan growth. Now, on the flipside, I\u2019d say we underperformed a bit this quarter on the home lending side. Despite increased origination volumes, gain on sales margins were down and I will finish with a quick update on a couple of our strategic priorities, including our need to ramp up consumer lending and our middle-market expansion.","And just on the consumer lending front, as you know, we have a lot of work to do and it\u2019s going to take a while, but we are focused we have made some important leadership changes and we are making progress. As an example, we just recently launched a new Cash Rewards credit card that helped us to produce a substantial increase in volume. In fact, June was a record month for digital card account openings. Additionally and we have talked about this before, we have booked nearly $100 million in new loans as part of our digital consumer unsecured installment loan pilot since the fourth quarter launch.","Within the corporate bank, we expanded our middle-market franchise in the Dallas, Kansas City and Minneapolis-St. Paul at the start of the year. And we have been hiring or relocating top talent to each market and embedding ourselves in the communities through our traditional Regional Presidents model. Now, the approach we are taking in these markets is very similar to what we have done in Chicago and the Southeast, but it is a long-term play, but we are very pleased with the initial momentum of our efforts and what we are generating in all three markets.","We have also recently formalized plans to continue the expansion of our middle-market businesses in three additional markets, Denver, Houston and Nashville in 2018. And like Dallas, Kansas City and the Twin Cities, PNC already has a significant presence through our national businesses in each of these markets. And I know it\u2019s a busy day for everybody ahead and we\u2019d like to leave plenty of time for questions. So, I will turn it over to Rob to run you through the results for the quarter in greater detail and then we will open it up for Q&A. Rob?","Rob Reilly","Thanks, Bill and good morning, everyone. As Bill just mentioned, our second quarter net income was $1.1 billion or $2.10 per diluted common share. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. Total loans grew by $4.1 billion or 2% linked quarter. Commercial lending was up $4.4 billion from the first quarter as we saw broad-based growth in nearly every category. This growth also reflected the impact of a $1 billion loan and lease portfolio acquired as part of the ECN transaction, which closed in the early second quarter.","Consumer lending decreased by approximately $300 million linked quarter as declines in home equity and education lending were somewhat offset by increases in residential real estate, auto lending and credit card.","On a spot basis, we saw a slight increase in consumer lending driven by growth in residential mortgage, auto and credit card loans. Investment securities decreased by approximately $900 million linked quarter, maturities and payoffs outpace net purchases as we saw fewer opportunities for reinvestment given the flat yield curve environment during much of the second quarter. On a spot basis, investment securities were essentially flat as we increased our purchase activity toward the end of June.","Compared to the same quarter a year ago, average securities were up $5.2 billion or 7%. Our interest-earning deposits with banks mostly at the Federal Reserve averaged $22.5 billion for the second quarter, down $1.6 billion from the first quarter. On a spot basis, balances held with the Federal Reserve declined $5.4 billion in part reflecting loan growth. On the liability side, total deposits increased by $1.5 billion or 1% compared to the first quarter driven by consumer deposits. As of June 30, 2017, our fully phased-in Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated to be 9.8%. Our tangible book value increased $68 \u2013 I am sorry increased to $68.55 per common share as of June 30. Our return on average assets for the second quarter was 1.19%, consistent with the first quarter and our return on tangible common equity was 12.67%, an increase of 52 basis points.","As you can see on Slide 5, we have returned substantial capital to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, while maintaining an overall strong capital position. In the second quarter, we fully completed the common stock repurchase programs we announced last year. Over the last four quarters, we returned a total of $3.4 billion of capital to shareholders. As Bill mentioned, following the CCAR results last month, we announced a new plan to repurchase up to $2.7 billion of shares over the next four quarters. This represents a 17% increase compared to our recently completed share repurchase programs. And importantly, the chart on the bottom of the slide shows the progression of our dividend increases. Earlier this month, we announced a 36% increase in the quarterly dividend to an all-time high of $0.75 per share. This will be effective with the upcoming August dividend.","As you can see on Slide 6, net income was $1.1 billion and we continued to deliver positive operating leverage on both the linked quarter and year-over-year basis. Revenue was up $176 million or 5% from the first quarter driven by growth in both net interest income and fee income. Non-interest expense increased by $77 million or 3% compared to the first quarter, which overall was in line with our guidance. As a result, we delivered strong pre-tax pre-provision earnings. Provision for credit losses in the second quarter was $98 million as overall credit quality remained stable. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 26%. For the full year 2017, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 25% and 26%.","Now, let\u2019s discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to Slide 7, net interest income increased by $98 million or 5% linked quarter primarily driven by higher loan yields and balances, somewhat offset by higher borrowing and deposit costs. Additionally the second quarter benefited from one additional day compared to the first quarter. Net interest margin was 2.84%, an increase of 7 basis points compared to the first quarter primarily due to higher interest rates.","As you can see on Slide 8 non-interest income increased by $78 million or 5% linked quarter, driven by fee income growth. Compared to the second quarter of last year total non-interest income was up by $76 million or 4%. Looking at the various categories asset management fees which includes earnings from our equity investment in BlackRock were essentially flat compared to the first quarter, compared to the same quarter last year asset management fees increased by $21 million or 6% reflecting higher equity markets and growth in assets under management. Consumer services fees were up $28 million or 8% compared to first quarter results reflecting seasonally higher client activity with growth in debit and credit card and increased merchant services activity. Compared to the same quarter a year ago consumer services fees were up 2% due to increased customer activity. Within that higher credit card fees were offset by elevated year-over-year rewards activity. Corporate services fees increased by $41 million or 10% compared to the first quarter as a result of higher loan syndication and treasury management fees. Notably, Harris Williams had another strong quarter. Compared to the same quarter a year ago corporate services fees were up $31 million or 8%, primarily due to higher capital markets and treasury management fees.","Residential mortgage non-interest income decreased $9 million or 8% linked quarter as servicing fees declined. Overall originations were up, but the mix shift from refinance to purchase volume lowered our loans sales revenue. Compared to the same quarter a year ago residential mortgage non-interest income decreased $61 million or 37%, primarily driven by lower loan sales revenue and lower net hedging gains on mortgage servicing rights. Service charges on deposits increased by $9 million or 6% compared to the first quarter, driven by seasonally higher customer activity. Other non-interest income increased $14 million linked quarter and included higher gains on an increased volume of multi-family loan sales in our commercial mortgage banking business, higher security gains and higher operating lease income related to the ECN acquisition. Going forward, we expect this year\u2019s quarterly run rate for other non-interest income to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million.","Turning to Slide 9, second quarter expenses increased by $77 million or 3% linked quarter. This reflected seasonally lower occupancy costs along with seasonally higher marketing and business activities as well as increased equipment expense. Equipment expense in the quarter was higher primarily due to two factors. First, we now include the operating expenses resulting from the ECN acquisition. And second we had elevated asset impairments and some accelerated depreciation on equipment in the quarter. As we previously stated, our continuous improvement program has the goal to reduce expenses by $350 million in 2017. Based on the first half results we are on track and confident we will achieve our annual target. As you know this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments including our retail brand strategy, enhanced digital capabilities in our home lending transformation. These investments are multi-year efforts designed to better meet our customers\u2019 needs.","Turning to Slide 10, overall credit quality remained stable in the second quarter. Total non-performing loans were down $41 million or 2% linked quarter and total delinquencies decreased by $58 million or 4%. Provision for credit losses was $98 million in the second quarter. This included an initial provision for the acquired ECN loan portfolio that was largely offset by a benefit from the performance of certain residential real estate loans and home equity lines of credit reaching draw period ending. Net charge-offs decreased $8 million to $110 million in the second quarter and the annualized net charge-off ratio was 20 basis points, down 3 basis points linked quarter. In summary, PNC posted a successful second quarter driven by growth in loans, fee income and net interest income along with well managed expenses. For the remainder of the year, we expect continued steady growth in GDP and a 25 basis point increase in short-term interest rates in December.","As you can see on Slide 11 looking ahead to the third quarter of 2017 compared to the second quarter of 2017 reported results, we expect modest growth in loans, we expect net interest income to be up in the low single-digits, we expect fee income to be stable, we expect expenses to be stable and we expect provision to be between $75 million and $125 million. As a result, our full year 2017 guidance compared to 2016 full year results remains unchanged.","And with that Bill and I are ready to take your questions.","Bryan Gill","Carlos could you please give us the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Bill Demchak","Hi, good morning John.","John Pancari","Regarding the guidance, I know you just indicated that you maintains the full year \u201817 guidance, why not up particularly the revenue guidance, it\u2019s still at the upper end of the mid single-digit range with the guidance is, but you clearly head upside to that this quarter and just curious why not move that? Thanks.","Rob Reilly","Yes. Hi John, good morning, it\u2019s Rob. Well, we are pleased with our results obviously in the second quarter and we are well positioned for the balance of the year, but there is still a lot of the year to go. So we are still comfortable with that guidance in the upper end of the mid single-digit range that we talked about on the first quarter call and the second quarter results play into that.","John Pancari","Okay. And I guess tied to that the loan growth guidance you also didn\u2019t change that, I mean is there an expectation that you are going to come off this high single-digit level where you are operating right now on an annualized basis from loan growth back to that mid single-digit range, is that why you are not moving that, is that one of the drivers?","Rob Reilly","Well we are sort of mid single-digits right now year-over-year. So that\u2019s why we are still calling to stay in that range.","John Pancari","Despite the linked quarter annualized being in the high single-digit range?","Rob Reilly","Yes, that\u2019s right, more in terms of the year than in terms of the run rate.","John Pancari","Okay, alright. Then lastly the \u2013 I just want to get your updated thoughts around the BlackRock stake Bill, just there is clearly given the expectations around potential tax reform and etcetera, there is still a lot of interest in what \u2013 how soon you could move on that if you decide to and what you could do with the capital, so again just looking to get your updated thoughts? Thanks.","Bill Demchak","I don\u2019t know that I have any updated thoughts beyond what we have discussed in the past. We will wait and see obviously if there was some form of tax reform at the margin that would help us should we be interested in moving the position. But we haven\u2019t come to that conclusion. It\u2019s been a good investment. We will get a return on capital and they are a great company. So as we have said before, we will be good stewards of capital or watch what happens as it relates to regulation, capital requirements and tax policy and make decisions, informed decisions when real things happen.","John Pancari","Alright. Thank you.","Rob Reilly","Thanks John.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning.","Bill Demchak","Good morning.","Rob Reilly","Hi Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Hey, a couple questions. One is on the new offices, new geographies that you are looking to expand into, could you give us a sense of the timing of the size of these geographies relative to the expansion that you did a few years back in Dallas, Minneapolis and Kansas City, just want to get a sense of opportunity from these new locations versus what you have been able to deliver from the most recent expansion cities?","Bill Demchak","Well, the \u2013 we will just start back at the beginning. We chose a year and change ago to go national with our middle market franchise, independent of whether we had a retail presence there, because we were pretty confident about our ability to succeed given what we have seen in the Southeast. We then targeted markets and we have a fairly long list of them where we already have a national presence in some of our national businesses I think real estate, treasury management business credit and so forth. And then looked at just broad potential client opportunities inside of those markets that led us into Kansas City, Minneapolis and Dallas as a start and the same as we go, Nashville, Houston and Denver. Those markets, as an aside, in terms of potential targets of middle-market clients on average are better than the markets we are in, which is what\u2019s driving us there. So, we think there is a big opportunity. Now, I would tell you we are just recently up and running in Dallas, Minneapolis and Houston, we have got a bit of business we have the teams in place, but its early days and the strategy through that will be as we did in the Southeast. We are going to be patient. We are going to get to know that communities become part of the communities, cover the right clients with the right products and the right people and through time we have kind of proven to ourselves again and again that we will win business, but it takes time.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then just when you say better than \u2013 it\u2019s \u201cbetter\u201d market than the markets you are in, is that just a simple\u2026.","Bill Demchak","Simple targets, how many companies are out there that need \u2013 middle-market companies think of them $500 million to $1 billion that need the products and services that we offer. When we go head-to-head with that type of client with any competitor in the market, we have a good chance of winning. And when we are in the market locally delivering products and services locally, it increases our odds.","Rob Reilly","Yes, Betsy, this is Rob. I can add to that. As you know, the source of our optimism in terms of these markets comes from our success in the Southeast, where our commercial products and services have sold very well maybe in the \u2013 maybe to a certain extent more than we expected on relatively thin retail presence. So based on that success, we are taking it to these other markets where as Bill mentioned we have a presence and we think we will be able to continue to succeed on that basis.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then expansion into consumer from there, from these new markets, is that in the long-term plan or not a part of this?","Bill Demchak","It\u2019s not a part of our current thinking. I would tell you that as our clients increasingly become digital, there is a storyline that suggest that on a digital basis, we are national today and those markets become relevant to us on a retail basis through digital, but not in the traditional retail sense.","Betsy Graseck","Great, got it. Okay, thanks so much.","Bryan Gill","Thanks, Betsy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Yes, hi. Good morning.","Bill Demchak","Hi, Erika.","Rob Reilly","Hi Erika.","Erika Najarian","My first question is you are clearly continuing to outperform your peers in terms of your deposit cost pass-through and I am wondering what your thoughts are in terms of the impact of the Fed balance sheet reduction in terms of outflows for your particular deposit base and how that could shift the beta outlook?","Bill Demchak","I guess, we had a \u2013 let\u2019s just talk about what\u2019s going on with betas first and then we will talk about Fed balance sheet, which is a whole other question. On the beta side, we have been effectively at zero on the retail side. We have seen some mix shift as customers have come out of our promo money market into our sort of relationship base rate that we pay in our virtual wallet product, but net-net we have seen, what, Rob, a couple of basis points of increase since the start of the increase in higher rates. In C&IB, you have a mix, the basic, I\u2019ll it hot money from corporates has a beta effectively of 90%. It kind of trades right on top of government money funds. And then there is another block of money that\u2019s compensating balances for TM that has much lower beta and that probably continues. I think what happens through time. So, we will see when the Fed makes the decision to reduce its balance sheet and they have announced that they will do that somewhat gradually and through time that will drive liquidity out of the market. We will see the biggest impact of that in my view coming out of the corporate side first, which has the highest beta therefore it has the least impact on us. I think the consumer side is going to be driven frankly by continued increases in short-term rates by the Fed as opposed to the necessary shrinking of their balance sheet, which is going to occur over the course of years, the way they have scheduled it out.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And my second question is, Bill, you mentioned that you made some leadership changes in consumer lending and you are continuing to focus on ramping it up, but I am wondering if you can give us just a little bit more detail on some of the change in strategy in terms of how you are approaching your market here?","Bill Demchak","Sure. It\u2019s going back in history, our focus on retail was serving the client and primarily focused on getting the household DDA account as the primary product, right, as we made a lot of money on deposits and rates were higher. And lending was treated, frankly, as an ancillary business. It was not a focus. And through time, we just didn\u2019t have the market share with our clients that we should in terms of penetration with consumer products. So, it\u2019s not a lot more complicated than that. The result of that strategy led to underinvestment in technology we were slow in fulfillment. We were slow in creativity of the way we offered products through digital and e-signature and all the rest and that\u2019s what we are working on. So, we are not jumping into \u2013 people asked the question why you are going to jump into consumer at a time when you necessarily see consumer delinquencies increasing. We are not really changing the credit that we are going to go after. We just need to go after the clients we already have with a competitive product and delivered in a way that is much simpler than we have done historically.","Rob Reilly","So enhancing our competency really rather than changing risk profile.","Erika Najarian","I see. Got it. Thank you, guys.","Bryan Gill","Thanks, Erika.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John McDonald with AB Global. Please go ahead.","John McDonald","Hi, good morning guys. I was wondering about the competitive environment in commercial lending had a nice move up in loan yields this quarter from the Fed hikes. How have spreads been and what are the competitive environments on spreads?","Bill Demchak","Spreads actually increased quarter-on-quarter at the margin, I think across basically all products.","Rob Reilly","Yes, yes, small increases, but increases.","Bill Demchak","It remains competitive. Our loan growth basically comes from winning clients and a bit of a \u2013 there is a bit of a mix shift, we had, had some declines in asset-based lending I think as borrowers went to cash flow, that\u2019s come back so we have seen growth in asset base where we have been kind of flat to down for a couple of quarters. In fact, we are seeing and this is a good sign, increase in utilization and asset-based on the manufacturing side would suggest maybe there is some strength behind, I guess we saw it in industrial production today behind the manufacturing economy.","John McDonald","Do you see that in core middle-market as well, Bill, the utilization increase or is this still you still winning business more?","Bill Demchak","It was up a bit middle-market as well. And as I said in my comments in commercial, which is the 10 to 50 think about a space, this is the second quarter in a row for us for growth, which we had been declining as first as we burn off balances from RBC and National City, but that\u2019s really good news to me. And in the middle-market space, it\u2019s as much just winning clients but we have had four or five quarters of growth and this is \u2013 middle-market itself was I think 4% quarter-on-quarter growth, additional non-specialty product basic loans.","John McDonald","And on the consumer side, Bill, is it too early to have an early read on the Zelle rollout? Are the customers kind of starting to know about it and understand it and feel comfortable using it?","Bill Demchak","It\u2019s very early days. We have been up and running here on our virtual wallet app. We haven\u2019t yet rolled it out. We are going to do so in a couple of weeks into our traditional online app. I think across the market awareness is up from zero to what is it 8% or something now. Much higher than that is more transactions go through. There has been a little bit of publicity about inconsistency in performance and some other things that frankly doesn\u2019t surprise me given the rollout of the new product that has a number of products that are trying to do it all at the same time, but we remain really bullish and it\u2019s kind of performing as expected at this point.","John McDonald","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Bryan Gill","Yes. Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rob Placet","Hey, good morning. This is Rob from Matt\u2019s Team. Just first on capital markets this quarter, anything in particular that drove the strength and maybe your outlook for the second half?","Bill Demchak","Sure. In terms of this particular quarter, capital markets, at least in the way that we define it, our loan syndications and loan underwriting had a particularly good quarter. And then as I mentioned in the opening comments, Harris Williams, our M&A advisory shop, had a very good quarter comparable to their very good quarter in the first quarter, so not up a lot linked quarter, but a lot up year-to-date. So, yes, we feel good about that. As far as the second half of the year, that\u2019s all baked into our guidance. For the third quarter, we expect our corporate services, of which capital markets is part of to be down a bit, but for the balance of the year consistent with our guidance.","Rob Placet","Okay. And then a similar question on treasury management, this is the business you have highlighted you made some significant investments in, again anything in particular drive the strength this quarter and should we think about this as being the new run rate going forward?","Bill Demchak","Yes. I think so, I mean in terms of our treasury management we have been talking about it, highlighting it as it\u2019s our largest business inside corporate service, fits very well with our lending product and part of the success that we are having there is part of the increased activity, but also the investments that we are making in those products and services, so yes I think the run rate is good.","Rob Reilly","We are just executing on the plan?","Bill Demchak","Yes. Executing on the plan, that\u2019s right.","Rob Placet","Okay, thanks very much.","Bill Demchak","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Scott Siefers","Good morning guys. Rob I was hoping you could spend a second talking about mortgage gain on sale margins coming under pressure for you and others, which is definitely expected at this point in the cycle, but I guess order of magnitude might be a little more than I would have anticipated, could you speak a little to sort of the competitive trend you are seeing, how things are coming in versus sort of what you would have expected and sort of where we go from here?","Rob Reilly","Yes. I think if you take a look at the mortgage \u2013 the mortgage fees, it\u2019s clearly softer. As far as the margins go, they are down a bit from what we have had. As you know about us, our margins are typically higher because we don\u2019t to the brokered mortgage products. So where we guide to $300 million, I think this quarter we came in at $274 million or something, which really reflects the make shifts, refis way down and purchases were actually up a bit. So going forward we sort of the guide towards stable, maybe we will see an increase in some of the refis here and again in Q3 which will help some of the margins, but we are still sticking to and managing to and expecting $300 million\u2026","Bill Demchak","I would tell you though. There is an internal debate volume versus margin here within our own teams, so we are kind of saying stable, but I think it is one of the things that we got to watch, because it clearly has become more competitive inside a market that\u2019s shrinking.","Rob Reilly","So same place that we acknowledge the pressure.","Scott Siefers","Yes, okay, alright. Thank you. And then may be switching gears a little, so your balances on deposit with the Fed, I think are the lowest they have been in last few years, just wondering if you could talk about liquidity deployments sort of further liquidity deployment as you would \u2013 opportunities as you would see and how much more is there to go so to speak?","Bill Demchak","Look, deployment this quarter was basically through quality loan growth, so to the extent we continue to see that we are happy to draw down on the balances with the Fed and we have a lot of room to be able to do that. Security balances you saw were basically flat and yields on security balances were basically flat. So I don\u2019t know that you will see us in a race to move money into term rate markets at this point, but to extent we get healthy loan growth we will draw down on those balances.","Scott Siefers","Thanks. Okay, good. Thank you, guys.","Bill Demchak","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Usdin","Alright. Thanks very much guys. Good morning.","Bill Demchak","Hi Ken.","Ken Usdin","Hey, I just wanted to ask you a little bit, can you help us understand how much of the quarter was helped by the lease deal, do we get more of that run rating into the third quarter and trying to just understand the magnitude of benefits to the overall picture?","Rob Reilly","Yes. I \u2013 generally speaking Ken, for the full year the acquisition it is pretty de minimis. Where it showed up somewhat materially is this quarter and most of that was in the form of the credit provision which was the initial provision set up as part of the acquisition. So, it shows up a bit here in the second quarter, but the balance of the year it will fade.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And then so expenses obviously, Rob you pointed reported to operating leverage, you are definitely growing revenues far faster than expenses and this year you did pivot a little bit away from just focusing on dollars of expenses as opposed to just the leverage and the efficiency ratio, so I just wanted \u2013 if you can kind of help us understand pacing revenues good, so expenses are higher, but revenue growth was 5% year-over-year \u2013 expense growth sorry was 5% year-over-year, the timing of just your investments versus your saves and all those structured programs that you had walked us though in the last couple of months, can you just give us an update on that?","Rob Reilly","Yes, sure. So I am glad to clarify that our revenues was 6.5, the expense growth is 5%. I think when you take a look at the expenses and Bill mentioned in his comments, we remained very focused on it intensely and that\u2019s part of our continuous improvement program which funds the investments that we are making. When you look at the quarter, the other expense of $666 million is higher than what it\u2019s been. We guide to $625 million to $700 million, so it\u2019s a little higher than the middle of that range and most of that is due to timing. So if you back off a little bit Ken just in the spirit of your question and look at other expenses as a component of expense year-to-date compared \u201817 \u2013 compared to \u201816 year-to-date it\u2019s $1.291 billion compared to last year six months $1.245 billion. That difference of $46 million is almost entirely due to the FDIC surcharge. So everything else offsets itself except for the FDIC surcharge. Now as you know that was implemented in the third quarter of last year, so when we get into the back half of the year that comp becomes a little easier.","Ken Usdin","Understood, okay. Thanks a lot Rob.","Rob Reilly","Sure.","Bill Demchak","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning Rob and good morning Bill.","Rob Reilly","Hi Gerard.","Bill Demchak","Good morning.","Gerard Cassidy","I got a question on the middle market success that you had and I think Bill you mentioned that there seem to be more lending going to asset backed from the cash flow lending, are you guys picking up market share in addition to showing this growth, is there any evidence of that?","Bill Demchak","I think it\u2019s all I mean beyond the increase in some utilization and the equipment finance acquisition, it\u2019s all market share. Some of that\u2019s in ABL, but frankly the middle market commercial wins are basically on-boarding new clients and the balances that come with them.","Rob Reilly","And similar to shat we said before it\u2019s just a function of executing our strategies in those geographies and those product areas.","Gerard Cassidy","I see. And credit is obviously very strong for you and your peers, when you talk to Hannon [ph] and others looking at credit on a day-to-day basis, are there any issues on the horizon that they are focused on, again I know it\u2019s not going to come soon, but where do they spend their time today?","Bill Demchak","I am sorry, I have not followed who are we talking about our credit people or\u2026?","Gerard Cassidy","Yes. Your credit\u2026?","Bill Demchak","We focus on all the headline items that you read about whether its oil and gas or retail exposure or auto ticking up or card, but none of that is kind of showing up inside of our numbers. Because we really never changed our credit box and have it on the consumer side and all else equal to consumer remains healthy notwithstanding certain consumer products in the sub-prime space struggling. We have oil and gas issues appear at this point to be less than they have once were and retail is going to play out through a lot of \u2013 long period of time. We are going to have to see how that plays out given the strength of online.","Rob Reilly","But we are \u2013 but by design diversified in terms of our loan portfolio in each of those buckets although we feel good about them are small percentages of the overall portfolio.","Gerard Cassidy","Good. And I assume since your shared national credit exam was done in the spring, your second quarter results would reflect any comments from the regulators on the SNC [ph] exam?","Rob Reilly","Yes, fully\u2026","Gerard Cassidy","Okay, good. And then just lastly Bill I mean you guys have done a phenomenal job on the acquisitions of Nat City and Riggs National and RBC, the markets have certainly changed now and you have been very disciplined in the way you approached acquisitions, if you look out over the next 2 years to 3 years, do you envision CCAR to CCAR banks combining, these are banks over $50 billion in assets combining maybe with $200 billion bank and what\u2019s your view on where PNC would fit into that process?","Bill Demchak","I will just speak through own situation and we have been pretty consistent on this. It\u2019s really difficult to come up with a case current valuations where we would be interested in buying a traditional bank franchise that the business itself has changed in terms of the percentage is going digital but the need for branches has lessen. We don\u2019t like the balance sheets, I mean all the issues I have gone though before. Having said that, across the industry I would expect that people are subscale, that are subscale and you can define that however you want are going to feel the need to merge to be able to compete with that increasing investments necessary to serve consumers. What\u2019s going to be allowed by the regulatory regime I don\u2019t know, but I don\u2019t think you are going to see us be a player inside of that consolidation other than just buying growing \u2013 sorry just growing share organically which we have been successful at doing.","Gerard Cassidy","No doubt. Speaking in the subscale how does this technology spending do you think fits into your definition of subscale, do you think that could be a real catalyst for some banks that they just can\u2019t afford to keep up with the technology spending, especially with the digitalization of banking that you guys have grasped effectively?","Bill Demchak","Yes. I think without question the base cost of getting the right infrastructure and then being able to integrate that in terms of your offerings to clients. There is a lot of money. You have seen us spend it out and we continue to spend. And it doesn\u2019t shrink dramatically as you reduced the size of the institution in terms of the total dollars you are spending.","Rob Reilly","In fact that it\u2019s a primary driver really in terms of the industry.","Gerard Cassidy","Guys, I appreciate your insights as always. Thank you.","Rob Reilly","See you, Gerard.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin Barker","Good morning. Could you speak to how spreads have changed in recent months with several competitors pulling back from the auto market and your overall view in the competitive dynamics given that there has been quite a shift in who is involved and who is not involved in the market at this point?","Bill Demchak","Just in auto specifically?","Kevin Barker","Auto specifically.","Bill Demchak","Yes. We have \u2013 just to remind you, we are not in the lease business, we are not in the sub-prime business. I think our average FICO on that is at 740. So, our credit life hasn\u2019t changed, so we continue to see growth. So, we haven\u2019t pulled back. We just have never \u2013 we never stuck our toes over the edge of the cliff.","Rob Reilly","Yes. We are not playing in the space that you are obviously referencing. And just to add that even, our tenure \u2013 our average tenure is 71 months. So, it just gives you a sense of the quality of the book.","Bill Demchak","Versus a couple years ago, our growth as slowed, but we are still growing that book.","Rob Reilly","Yes.","Kevin Barker","Okay. And then in regards to the Check Ready product that you introduced, could you give us an update on the penetration of that?","Rob Reilly","On the auto.","Kevin Barker","Yes.","Rob Reilly","Well, yes, the Check Ready product is an important product that we have particularly on our direct auto portfolio, which is growing as well. So, it\u2019s\u2026.","Bill Demchak","Much higher percentage.","Rob Reilly","Yes and new volume included\u2026","Bill Demchak","But mobile Check Ready comes out, I mean, kind of now third quarter, which gets launched basically and you can effectively apply and accept on your mobile app as opposed to doing it through branch or online.","Kevin Barker","So, are you seeing an increased amount of percentage in that product in the penetration of it or is it still very early days before you can really see?","Bill Demchak","Well, it\u2019s growing at a much higher percentage off a smaller base.","Rob Reilly","Yes, it\u2019s a small book. So of our $12 billion in auto loans, $2 billions is direct, $10 billion is indirect.","Kevin Barker","Okay. And then shift gears on commercial deposits, you saw about a $1.1 billion decline in your non-interest bearing commercial deposits \u2013 in the commercial deposits roughly 10% on an annualized basis. Could you speak to the shift that you are seeing there, where the short end of the yield curve is now and what your expectations are for outflows in non-interest bearing deposits on the commercial side?","Rob Reilly","Yes. I think most of the decline that you are referring to is on an average basis and most of that seasonality, actually commercial deposits on a spot basis increased in the quarter. So, I talked most of that up to seasonality and then everything going forward relates really what Bill is talking about earlier on the beta question in terms of some of the movement there. So first and foremost, seasonality in the second quarter going forward is part of this beta discussion and sort of the hot money how that behaves versus the traditional relationship money.","Kevin Barker","Okay, thank you.","Rob Reilly","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","David Eads","Good morning. Yes, David Eads on for Saul. Maybe following up on the deposit, I think in the comment earlier, it sounds like maybe we are on the early stages of seeing a little bit of competition on the consumer side as well. But I just want to see if you had any \u2013 if you are seeing anything of people kind of competing for marginal depositors or any kind of seeing competitors start getting promotional, whether anything has shifted in your outlook for how the consumer betas might end up trajectorying from here?","Bill Demchak","We really haven\u2019t seen a shift either in our own strategy or from our competitors.","Rob Reilly","On the consumer side.","Bill Demchak","On the consumer side. There is obviously a small, but growing online presence of deposit gatherers who are paying well above what traditional bank pays, but it\u2019s a tiny percentage of total consumer deposits. I think we are a couple of moves away from the Fed before you start really seeing the positive beta shift on the consumer side.","David Eads","Okay, thanks. And then have you guys given any color on how much of the growth, you talk about the kind of broad-based growth and taking share on the commercial lending side, how much of that came from the new growth markets versus your legacy markets, I know you don\u2019t traditionally give any kind of breakout there, but I was just curious if you could give any sense there?","Rob Reilly","Yes, most of that would be more in the Southeast as you know with these other markets were new. Legacy growth is there, but the Southeast markets are going at a faster rate.","Bill Demchak","Yes, on a percentage basis.","Rob Reilly","On a percentage basis.","Bill Demchak","Sure. Balance wise, its spread across all our markets.","Rob Reilly","Yes that\u2019s right.","David Eads","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Rob Reilly","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Foran","Hey, guys. I was wondering if you could ask about capital maybe longer term. So, I\u2019d think and correct me if I am misstating this, but I think when you have kind of talked about the big picture for you guys on capital, it\u2019s been somewhere in the 8s as a CET1 target, but the challenging getting there has always been the CCAR, partly because of the process and partly because the tendency to outperform your budget or your capital plan, which we see with earnings as well. So I realize the treasury white paper is \u2013 it\u2019s not even really at proposal stage, just like a broad recommendation stage. But just conceptually if CCAR did change, if buybacks in balance sheet growth were less part of the process or not a part of the process at all, I mean, you really don\u2019t lose money even in this really adverse scenarios, so how would that change your thinking or the timing around your excess capital position?","Bill Demchak","That\u2019s an involved question. Yes, I guess in its simplest form and the industry has proposed this that CCAR got to a place where we could rely on our own models as opposed to necessarily Fed output. So we had more certainty on outcomes and what we actually believed was risk. We would be more aggressive in returning capital than we are today maybe that\u2019s a simplest answer. Now, all of that is hypothetical, because as you said while there is comments on that inside the treasury paper, they are just comments at this point and we will see what in fact happens with the CCAR process as we go forward.","Brian Foran","And maybe just speaking on the same theme, as you look through all the proposals or recommendations in that paper, are there any that stand out to you as most impactful for your business or your outlook?","Bill Demchak","I mean two in particular. I like the fact that they reference you should look at what a company actually does is to use arbitrary size thresholds in the way you set regulations. So we have the $50 billion and the $250 billion and wherever the G-SIFIs come in. We actually like the systemic risk indicated that they used to identify G-SIFIs as a measure to look at the riskiness of a firm. And were they to do that, we would fall well down from some of the people we are bucketed with today on LCR. And on LCR itself inside of treasury paper, they also talk about the fact that they should re-look at some of the assumptions broadly for the whole market as it relates to liquidity requirements and the impact that, that\u2019s having on loan growth.","Rob Reilly","So, those would be our two biggest and obviously they are related, regulation driven towards the complexity and the risk versus arbitrary size.","Brian Foran","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Rob Reilly","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please go ahead.","Brian Klock","Hey, good morning gentlemen.","Bill Demchak","Hi Brian.","Brian Klock","So it\u2019s actually not a follow-up. But I do have a couple of just items that you guys haven\u2019t addressed yet, Rob earlier you mentioned the equipment expense for the quarter included an asset impairment charge, do you have the amount of that asset impairment charge in the quarter?","Rob Reilly","We haven\u2019t disclosed that Brian, but what I can tell you is that\u2019s unpredictable and lumpy. It happened to show up in the second quarter here, so I would expect equipment expense to decline quarter-over-quarter.","Brian Klock","Okay. And so you think something that\u2019s more in line with the first quarter level, is first quarter\u2026?","Rob Reilly","Yes. More in line with the first quarter level, a little above that because there is the ECN as I mentioned in my comments there is the ECN component, but with that below second quarter levels.","Brian Klock","Okay. And then just quickly on the ECN, out of the $1 billion of leases that you guys acquired on the asset side, how much of that are actually operating versus finance leases\u2026?","Rob Reilly","Yes. Actually of the $1.1 billion portfolio, the majority are loans that are pulled through in terms of the industry classification. The leases within that are about $100 million and most of those are the split. So the answer to your question is its more loans than leases.","Brian Klock","Okay. So there is no depreciation expense or maintenance or anything like that that\u2019s coming from the portfolio, if you have anything here in equipment would be the\u2026?","Rob Reilly","That\u2019s right.","Brian Klock","Got it, okay. And I am just thinking about, I know you guys haven\u2019t been giving the updated purchase accounting accretion, I know at the end of the year you talked about expected\u2026?","Rob Reilly","Yes, great job.","Brian Klock","Right. I was sorry about that, but the margin has been good even with the headwinds where you guys have talked about $75 million expected drop, so I just wanted to \u2013 is it still on pace, is it what you guys have expected?","Rob Reilly","Yes. Exactly on pace, $75 million decline, we are right on track which you would expect because as we get to these smaller levels the predictability is easier because the recoveries which always added volatility to that number are much smaller by definition because of where we are in the aging.","Brian Klock","Got it, okay. So I think the 278 last year so are you in \u2013 first half of the year you are on 140 million it\u2019s about\u2026?","Rob Reilly","You got. It comes down \u2013 yes, it comes down over time, but 278 and down 75 for the year. We will hit that number.","Brian Klock","Got it. So it\u2019s probably closer to 100 for the first half of the year?","Rob Reilly","Yes, depending on how you add that, that\u2019s right. Full year decline, that\u2019s right.","Brian Klock","Got it, fair enough. Thanks for your time guys.","Rob Reilly","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby","Thank you. I wanted to ask you kind of bigger picture question when you talk about going in the markets, I mean the Southeast was a market where you did have an acquisition and some presence and now you are going in the markets where you don\u2019t have that, the competition or the competitive advantage that you bring to the table what are couple of things that gives you the confidence that you can go in and win business from folks that are have been sitting in those markets over time?","Bill Demchak","Well, a couple of things. First is the markets we are going into we have had presence just not on the retail side. So we have had corporate clients there from our national businesses for years and we have had people in the markets there. What gives us confidence is over time simply as we become a larger company and a better known company and bluntly a company that is known to execute well on the C&IB space, we have been able to attract outstanding employees from some of our competitors. And as we open a market, we basically posted and we have been able to find lots of our internal up and comers who want to move and grow their careers in the new market. So we go there with great people, with great products and services. We put product, people and credit people in the market so we are local. We go in with the regional presidents model so that we could get involved with the local community. We introduced Grow Up Great, our philanthropic effort for early childhood education. And then we are patient, the better clients that you want to target are already well banked, we understand that. You call on them for a couple of years with good ideas and you are patient about it, they will come to recognize that and you get business and we have just proven that over and over again, in particular in the markets that we entered in the Southeast and we think it\u2019s going to work in these other new markets.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. And then Rob when we look at the credit, the biggest question we still push back is we are far along in this recovery and long in the tooth, it\u2019s been 8 years, so the credit cycle has to turn?","Rob Reilly","Yes.","Marty Mosby","Our number show that when we will look at the monitor, the R Index, we are kind of slowly kind of navigating back to neutral, but there isn\u2019t really any pressure, you are showing that in your credit numbers non-performers continuing to improve, you are still providing less and you have a net charge-off, so what are the tenets right now that should also give us some confidence which we believe is there that credit should stay stable to historically low for the next 12 months to 18 months?","Rob Reilly","Well, I think we talked about here on this call in terms of from the credit perspective we feel good about all our portfolios. The consumer is in very good shape as you know and on the corporate side everything even in the categories that are talked about and have scrutiny in the public arena we feel good about that\u2019s the short-term. I will say though these are very low cost in terms of credit costs on a historical basis. So we will see some normalization, but\u2026","Bill Demchak","We said \u2013 we would have told you this time last year that a year from now we ought to be from what we were 20 basis points this quarter. We are going to get to 40 basis points and 50 basis points through time. You would think just go and put a timeline on that because it\u2019s not showing up as you said in any of the day-to-day on the models we run today.","Rob Reilly","And you can\u2019t really just migrate to the average, you kind of even though we are kind of neutralizing that neutralization is probably 10 basis points to 15 basis points, there maybe even 20 basis points, but not a real shock step up in the sense of credit costs or provisioning given that I think there has been constraints in the industry that have caused folks to be a little bit stronger.","Bill Demchak","I mean, look it will be a migration. I can\u2019t I mean I don\u2019t know what it is that would cause a shock, but credit costs for our provision or our model based on an improvement or deterioration of the overall portfolio through a period of time. And what we have seen while you would \u2013 we would expect that as we got longer in this cycle you would see some deterioration or at least less recovery and less strength, yes. It just hasn\u2019t shown up. And what it does, it will probably be at the margin and creep up and not jump to a much higher level.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. And Rob thanks for highlighting the short-term rates being higher, being the benefit for margin, a lot of misconception about what long end does here, but the short end is what\u2019s driving a lot of this results and that was good to see in your presentation.","Rob Reilly","Well and loan growth.","Marty Mosby","Yes. Thank you, all.","Bryan Gill","Carlos do we have any more questioners.","Operator","No sir, there are no further questions.","Bryan Gill","Alright. Well, thank everybody and we will see you next quarter.","Bill Demchak","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded Friday, January 12, 2018.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bryan Gill. Sir, please go ahead.","Bryan Gill","Well, thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today\u2019s conference call for The PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today\u2019s presentation contains forward-looking information. Our forward-looking statements regarding PNC performance assume a continuation of continuing current economic trends and do not take into account the impact of potential legal and regulatory contingencies.","Actual results and future events could differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in our statements and from historical performance due to a variety of risks and other factors. Information about such factors, as well as GAAP reconciliations and other information on non-GAAP financial measures we discuss is included in today\u2019s conference call, earnings release and related presentation materials and in our 10-K, 10-Qs in various other SEC filings and investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations.","Throughout this presentation we refer to adjusted fourth quarter income statement amounts, which reflect the impact of federal tax legislation and significant items and additional details provided in the earning release and appendix to our slides. Also we have not factored into our forward-looking guidance the impact of any changes in customer behavior due to the new enacted federal tax legislation. These statements speak only as of January 12, 2018 and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bill Demchak.","William Demchak","Thanks, Bryan and good morning, everybody. As you have seen today, we reported full-year 2017 results with net income of $5.4 billion or $10.36 per diluted common share. Clearly our results benefited from new federal tax legislation that was signed into law in December.","And the good news is that tax reform has produced both current and future benefits for our shareholders including a significant increase in tangible book value per share this quarter and higher ongoing cash flow. Tax reform has also given us the flexibility to invest more in our businesses, our communities, and our employees, which helps drive our Main Street banking model.","The bad news for this quarter, if you can call it that, is that \u2013 is it really noisy quarter for us and I am going to leave it to Rob to walk you through all the various adjustments there. Excluding the impacts of tax legislation and the other significant items, our full-year 2017 net income was $4.5 billion or $8.50 per diluted common share.","2017 was a successful year for PNC and I do want to thank all of our employees for their continued hard work, as well as our clients for their trust in us. We grew loans and deposits and added customers across our businesses.","Importantly, we grew consumer loan balances albeit somewhat modestly for the first time in four years. And this has been a key focus for us going into the year and I am pleased that we are making progress here. We generated record fee income for the year and in the fourth quarter and we continued our focus on expense management and this isn't going to change as we go into 2018.","We executed on our strategic priorities, including the expansion of our middle market franchise into new markets, made important progress on our technology agenda, which is also driving the ongoing reinvention of our retail bank. We were particularly proud this year to earn the number one ranking in J.D. Power\u2019s National Bank Satisfaction Survey.","After years of work to modernize and fortify our information infrastructure, we are now investing more in our customer-facing digital products and services and in turn those investments are enabling us to deliver a higher quality more convenient and more secure banking experience.","You will see that we announced several smaller, but strategic acquisitions with [ECN], Vendor Finance, Trout Investor Relations, and Fortis Advisors, all of this work of course is aimed at creating long-term value for our shareholders.","And in 2017 PNC returned $3.6 billion of capital to shareholders. 2018 is going to be an important year for us as we continue to execute on a number of initiatives, including the ongoing build out of our digital products and services, the home lending transformation and the further expansion of our middle market lending franchise.","And with that, I\u2019ll let [Rob run] through the results in more detail and share with you our guidance for 2018 and then we will be happy to take questions. Rob?","Robert Reilly","Good morning and thanks Bill. As Bill just mentioned, our full-year net income was $5.4 billion or $10.36 per diluted common share. And fourth quarter net income was $2.1 billion or $4.18 per diluted common share. Both periods benefited from the new tax legislation, partially offset by significant items that I'll talk about in a moment.","Our balance sheet information is on Slide 4 and it is presented on an average basis. Loans grew $1.9 billion or 1% to $221.1 billion in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter. Commercial lending balances increased $1.6 billion and growth was broad-based across our C&IB businesses.","Consumer lending balances were up $300 million, as growth in residential mortgage, auto and credit card, more than offset lower home equity and education loans. For the year-over-year quarter comparison, total loans grew $10.2 billion or 5%. Commercial lending increased by $9.9 billion or 7%, again broad-based, and consumer lending was up $300 million.","Investment securities decreased by $200 million to $74.2 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with the third quarter on an average basis, but increased by $1.1 billion or 2% on a spot basis. Average investment securities declined by $1.8 billion, compared to the same quarter a year-ago as we faced a challenging reinvestment environment throughout most of 2017.","Our average balances at the Federal Reserve were $25.3 billion for the fourth quarter, up $1.9 billion from the third quarter driven by an increase in liquidity from higher deposits and borrowings. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, Fed balances increased by $600 million.","On the liability side, total deposits increased $2.1 billion or 1% to $261.5 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with the third quarter due to seasonal growth in commercial deposits. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, total deposits increased by $4.4 billion or 2%, reflecting growth in both our consumer and commercial businesses.","Average common shareholders' equity increased by approximately $300 million linked quarter and by $600 million year-over-year, driven by strong earnings, even as we continue to return substantial capital to our shareholders.","For the full-year 2017, we returned $3.6 billion of capital to shareholders. This represented a 17% increase over the prior year and was comprised of $2.3 billion in share repurchases and $1.3 billion in common dividends. Period end common shares outstanding were $473 million down $12 million or 2% compared to year end 2016.","As of December 31, 2017, our pro forma Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was estimated to be 9.8% inclusive of the impact of tax legislation, and tangible book value was $72.28 per common share as of December 31 up 7% compared to the same date a year-ago.","As you can see on Slide 5, net income was $5.4 billion for the full-year and $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Clearly these results were impacted by tax legislation and significant items that occurred in the fourth quarter. However, our underlying business performance remains strong. On a reported basis, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $4.3 billion up $135 million or 3% compared to the third quarter. This was driven by higher non-interest income and stable net interest income.","Full-year revenue was $16.3 billion up $1.2 billion or 8%. Net interest income increased by $717 million or 9% primarily due to commercial loan growth and favorable loan yields. Total non-interest income grew by $450 million or 7% reflecting overall business growth. Expenses continue to be well managed and remain a focus for us. The fourth quarter and full-year 2017 reported numbers as shown on this slide include the impact of approximately $500 million related to the significant items in the fourth quarter.","Provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter was $125 million down $5 million linked-quarter. Full-year provision of $441 million increased by $8 million compared to 2016. And overall credit quality remained stable. Finally, as you can see our income tax line benefited from the recent tax legislation. ","Turning to Slide 6, highlighted here are the significant items that impacted the fourth quarter. As a result of the federal tax legislation, we recognized the $1.2 billion net income tax benefit primarily due to the revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities, the majority of which are related to our equity stake in BlackRock.","In addition, we had significant items that occurred in the fourth quarter and they are as follows. As previously announced, a $200 million contribution to the PNC Foundation, which supports our communities in early childhood education. This amount was funded through a contribution of shares of BlackRock stock. And second, $105 million expense related to benefits for our employees, which includes a $1500 credit to employee cash balance pension accounts and a $1000 cash payment to approximately 90% of our employees. ","Other significant items not previously announced, but reported today are a $254 million non-interest income from the flow through of BlackRock\u2019s tax legislation benefit as a result of our equity investment. A $197 million charge related to real estate dispositions and exits including our data center strategy. As a result of the completed 2017 build-out of new data centers, we are now less reliant on some of our legacy sites. In total, these real estate dispositions will reduce PNC\u2019s managed square footage by approximately 10%.","And lastly, $319 million for two negative fair value adjustments one of which is $248 million related to our Visa Class B derivative agreements. This is primarily due to an extension of the expected timing of litigation resolution, and the second $71 million for our residential mortgage servicing rights fair value assumption updates.","Slide 7 shows the financial impact of tax legislation and significant items on our fourth quarter and full-year financial results. We believe these adjusted results better represents our underlying business performance and will be used as the basis for our first quarter and full-year 2018 guidance. As you can see, our adjusted full-year net income was $4.5 billion or $8.50 per diluted common share. And for the fourth quarter, our adjusted net income was $1.2 billion or $2.29 per share.","Turning to Slide 8, full-year 2017 revenue was $16.3 billion. Reported net interest income for 2017 increased by $717 million or 9% compared with 2016 driven by higher interest rates and loan growth partially offset by higher borrowing and deposit costs. Our net interest margin increased in 2017 to 2.87%, up 14 basis points. The full-year improvement was primarily driven by higher loan yields partially offset by higher borrowing costs.","Compared to the third quarter, net interest income was stable and net interest margin decline by three basis points to 2.88%. These results included the impact of tax legislation related to leveraged leases, which reduced fourth quarter NII by $26 million and NIM by three basis points.","Full-year non-interest income was up $450 million or 7%. Fourth quarter non-interest income was up $135 million or 8%. Both periods included broad-based growth in the majority of our fee businesses.","Slide 9 provides more detail on our non-interest income. We continue to execute on our strategies to grow our fee businesses across our franchise, and those efforts help to drive record fee income in 2017, even excluding the impact of tax legislation and other significant items. On both the reported and adjusted basis, non-interest income represented 44% of our 2017 revenue.","For the full-year, asset management revenue increased by $421 million or 28%. This included the $254 million flow through of tax legislation benefit as a result of our equity investment in BlackRock. In addition, higher average equity markets and assets under management, which grew from $137 billion at year-end 2016 to $151 billion as of December 31, 2017 contributed to the increase on a full-year and quarterly basis.","Consumer services fees grew $27 million or 2% for the full-year driven by higher debit card activity, brokerage fees and credit card activity net of rewards. On a linked-quarter basis, consumer services fees increased by $9 million or 3%.","Corporate services fees increased by $117 million or 8% in 2017. On a linked-quarter basis corporate services fees increased $52 million or 14%, in both periods results reflect stronger merger and acquisition advisory fees as well as higher treasury management and loans syndications fees.","Residential mortgage non-interest income declined both on a full-year and linked-quarter basis and included a negative $71 million impact related to update fair value assumptions for residential mortgage servicing rights. Beyond that lower production and lower sale sales revenue contributed to the decline.","Service charges on deposits for the full-year increased by $28 million or 4% driven by client growth and activity. And lastly full-year other non-interest income increased by $74 million or 7%. On a linked-quarter basis other non-interest income was down $152 million and included a net $129 million negative impact related to significant items.","Turning to Slide 10, expense management continues to be a focus for us and we remain disciplined in our overall approach. As you know we had 2017 goal of $350 million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program and we successfully completed actions to achieve that goal. Our full-year 2017 expenses were $10.4 billion compared to $9.5 billion in 2016, reflecting approximately $500 million of significant items in the fourth quarter.","These include the contribution to the PNC Foundation, real estate disposition and exit charges, along with employee cash payments and pension account credit. Importantly on an adjust basis, our efficiency ratio was 61% in 2017.","Looking forward to 2018, we have targeted an additional $250 million in cost saving through CIP, which we again expect to partially fund our continuing business and technology investments.","Turning to Slide 11, overall credit quality remain stable in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Total non-performing loans were essentially flat linked-quarter and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans.","Total delinquencies were up $101 million or 7%, compared to the prior period, reflecting increases in residential mortgage auto and credit card in part due to seasonality and the residual impact of Hurricane.","Provision for credit losses of $125 million decreased by $5 million linked-quarter, the provision for the consumer lending portfolio increased due to loan growth, the auto and credit card delinquencies I just mentioned and the impact of the home equity loan reserve release in the third quarter. These increases were more than offset by lower provision for commercial lending reflecting stable credit quality and the reversal of hurricane related qualitative reserves. Net charge-offs were essentially flat compared to the third quarter results and the annualized net charge-off ratio was 22 basis points.","In summary, PNC reported a very successful 2017 and we are well positioned for 2018. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we expect continued steady growth in GDP and a corresponding increase in short-term interest rates, three additional times this year. In June, September and December with each increase being 25 basis points.","Based on these assumptions, our full-year 2018 guidance compared to adjusted 2017 results as outlined on Slide 7 is as follows. We expect mid single-digit loan growth. We expect mid single-digit revenue growth. We expect a low single-digit increase in expenses, and we expect PNC\u2019s effective tax rate to be approximately 17%. Based on this guidance, we believe we will deliver positive operating leverage in 2018.","Looking ahead at the first quarter of 2018 compared to adjusted fourth quarter 2017 results, we expect modest loan growth. We expect total net interest income to remain stable. We expect fee income to be down low mid single-digits due to typically lower first quarter client activity and elevated fourth quarter fees in certain categories.","We expect other non-interest income to be in the $250 million to $300 million range. We expect expenses to be down low single-digits and we expect provision to be between $100 million and $150 million.","And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.","William Demchak","Jennifer, could you please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","John Pancari","Good morning.","William Demchak","Good morning, John.","Robert Reilly","Hey John.","John Pancari","The 17% expected tax rate appears to assume that not much of that really gets competed away, but listening to some of the banks talk about the competitive environment, it seems like there is going to be a longer-term risk that some of that benefit does erode over time. So I was just wondering if you can comment on your expectation there or do you think that you see some of that benefit find its way out of the numbers? Thanks.","William Demchak","I think in Rob\u2019s \u2013 that the tax rate is a tax rate, whether or not that above the line numbers get reduced as a function of lowering spreads and\/or higher deposit costs I think remains to be seen. So it's not really in our tax rate. It's kind of in [heavy] competition. Yes, because our return on equity is going to \u2013 after-tax return on equity is going to increase and in theory and in practice, you'll see some of that through time given to customers.","Robert Reilly","John, this is Rob. Just to broaden that question a little bit, it's early, obviously, we would expect based on historical sort of activity that banks will compete some of that away, but it's too early to tell in terms of the extent of that.","William Demchak","Yes. The other thing that to keep in mind when you \u2013 and this kind of jumps into theory, but our cost of capital actually increases because of the lower value of the tax shield from our funding. So you can actually give it all away and then there's just pure risk return that you get on the loan book that is sort of independent of in some ways what the tax rate is. So there's mitigating factors to some notion that you could just drop it off to clients.","John Pancari","Right. Got it. Okay. And then on that note separately, I wanted to ask about loan growth at least on your outlook. I know loans at least for the quarter were somewhat sluggish on an end of period basis and it sounds like some of that may have been in the mortgage finance or anything. So I want a little bit more color there, but separately on the outlook, your mid single-digit outlook for 2018 I would have expected maybe would have been a little bit higher than the 2017 expectation, but it's in line, it's somewhat stable. So why not see a real strengthening in loan growth in 2018?","Robert Reilly","We didn\u2019t assume a change in loan demand in effect, right. So if your question kind of comes along the lines, do we expect as a function of tax change and economic pick up that there might be more borrowings. We don't have that built into that number per se. Interestingly in the fourth quarter number, you're right in that we had a warehouse mortgage line for multifamily sort of runoff mid quarter, which on a spot basis caused numbers to decline.","But what was interesting, our originations in the fourth quarter in C&I were really healthy, what changed versus the third quarter was the paydowns on loans that were kind of taken up by capital markets. And in the real estate market, real estate loans that were taken out by permanent finance in a pretty aggressive terms. So our ability to win deals and fund deals continues to pays healthy.","John Pancari","Okay, great. Thank you.","William Demchak","Thanks John.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Please proceed with your question.","R. Scott Siefers","Good morning, guys. I appreciate the color on the sort of adjusted numbers and everything like that. Rob, question on the tax rate, so the 17% effective rate? Can you walk through what you would anticipate that implying for an FTE tax rate? I think there's typically been maybe call 250 basis point gap between your effective and FTE tax rate, so how does that change?","Robert Reilly","Yes. Not a big swing there, Scott. You just would reduce that by the compression of the lower tax rate, so not a big number to start with and roughly what 30% off of that.","R. Scott Siefers","Yes. Okay. And then any impact on the \u2013 like should we expect any visible step down in the FTE margin as a result of tax changes or anything or is that\u2026","Robert Reilly","Yes. We gauge it around 3 basis points.","R. Scott Siefers","Okay, great. Thank you. And then maybe more broadly now that tax change is official, any thoughts on how if at all the new role changes your capital return targets or aspirations?","Robert Reilly","Well, so that's a popular question, obviously, the answer to that is what you're going to expect, which is premature. We haven't received the Fed scenarios for this year's stress test. So that's a key component in determining what the capital return will be, but all else being equal because we have a lower tax rate in theory, if everything else stays equal, we'll have more to return.","William Demchak","And our bias inside of that as we've talked about before would be on the dividend side, but we\u2019ll finish out this or do we have two quarters Rob on the remaining CCAR and then see what they have in store for us on the next set. We have higher cash flow and we\u2019ll be biasing that cash flow subject to our Board of Directors approval, but towards the dividend I think.","Robert Reilly","As far as the mix between dividend and share repurchases.","R. Scott Siefers","Yes. Okay. All right, terrific. Thank you guys very much.","William Demchak","Sure Scott.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning.","William Demchak","Hi, good morning.","Robert Reilly","Hi, good morning, Erika.","Erika Najarian","So in context of the progress on consumer loan growth, Bill one of your peers said at an earlier conference call this morning. Mentioned that underwriting standards still remain a bit tight for residential mortgage and clearly everybody's waiting for potential rule changes from the agencies.","And I'm wondering this is sort of a two part question. If you could give us an update on the home lending transformation in terms of the origination prospects for this year and also sort of the whether or not the expense base is now right sized, and also do you agree with the view that there is still some embedded conservatism in terms of underwriting standards for residential mortgage?","William Demchak","Just on the underwriting standards, yes, the margin I would say that everybody just given past history has been more conservative than you otherwise might be given broad-based litigation risk and [put-back] risk. I\u2019ll let Rob comment a bit on the home lending transformation, but lead off by saying that we are not where we will be on expenses as we're still kind of running the implementation program and in some places doing systems.","Robert Reilly","Yes, I can add to that Erika. We're on track in terms of what our plans are. We did move mortgage originations this quarter to our new platform. We have plans to follow that up with home equity and mortgage here in the spring and then some more work in the later part of 2018. So the expense savings portion of that will most likely be in 2019, but we feel good about executing on the plan, which as you know is a very complex work set.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And just as a follow-up, Bill and Rob. So there is two dueling bipartisan 50 bills, the House clearly doesn't have an asset threshold and the Senate version still has an asset threshold of $250 billion. Should a dollar asset threshold prevail and prevail at $250 billion in terms of the [indiscernible] definition, does that at all change how you're thinking about capital management or just strategy generally speaking from here?","William Demchak","Well, I mean that bill wouldn't change anything for us, so it doesn't change the way we're thinking. And as a practical matter, our binding constrains or in effect that the thing that we're most concerned about in terms of leveling playing field is the LCR, which is not mentioned in that bill with that $250 billion threshold. But it is mentioned in the [indiscernible] bill. So we'd like to see and we think we will through time either through regulatory relief because it doesn't have to be through change or law or through change in law, some less hard lined approach to the way you said LCR exposure, and we keep pushing on that, we'll see where it goes. But that is kind of the single thing that impacts us.","Robert Reilly","That may or may not be determined by the threshold.","William Demchak","Yes.","Erika Najarian","Got it. I'll follow-up offline for the potential benefits. Thank you.","Robert Reilly","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","John McDonald","Have a nice outlook Rob for operating leverage in 2018. I was wondering and when we look at the revenue drivers in the mid single-digit. If you could give us a broad sense of what you're thinking about for revenue drivers and whether it's kind of roughly driven equally by fees in NII that would be helpful? Thanks.","Robert Reilly","Yes, sure John. Yes so mid single-digits both NII and fees going up mid single-digits and NII maybe the higher end of mid single-digits and non-interest income or the fee income sort of in the middle there, so both mid single-digits a little more in NII than the fees in terms of growth percentage.","John McDonald","Okay. And where are you feeling good about the kind of the fee drivers as you in the size of the year?","Robert Reilly","Yes, so when we take a look at the year just to breakdown the components of the fees, we would say up mid single-digits overall in terms of the components asset management up high single-digits, consumer services up mid single-digits, corporate services up low single-digits, and the reason for that is just because of the elevated performance in the fourth quarter, corporate services fees were record as you can see. And then the mortgage and service charges on deposits low single-digits \u2013 up low single-digits. All into get you to mid single-digits for the whole fees.","John McDonald","Got it. Okay, very helpful. Thanks very much.","Robert Reilly","Yes, sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes. Hi, good morning. This is Rob for Matt. Just questions on your excess liquidity. I was just curious if we can get an update on your thinking now that loan rates have backed up some here?","William Demchak","Yes. Just quickly, I mean it's elevated this quarter because we accelerated a little bit some borrowings that we did. Obviously we've seen a back up in rates over the last handful of weeks with a 10-year push [indiscernible] I guess is crossing 2%. And you would just see that the margin start deploying more cash.","Having said that, you've got to remember that the carry even with the higher backend rates is now reduced because it curves flat, but it is likely you'll see us put that money to work. We'd like to put it to work in floating rate assets, but as a practical matter we remain short on duration and have an opportunity to redeploy into Level 1 securities if we choose to.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then just separately as it relates to your branch footprint, you continue to reduce branch count this quarter. First, I was curious give a target number for branch consolidation this year. And then second, I noticed that your universal branch count has been trending lower in the last couple of quarters. I was wondering if you could speak to that.","Robert Reilly","Yes, sure. So a couple of things there. We\u2019ve been running in terms of branch consolidations that you see in the last couple of years on or around 100 branches a year and we would expect to be somewhere in that neighborhood in 2018. In regard to the universal branches themselves, in some cases, we've actually closed some universal branches because even though they're universal, they're measured the same way as our other branches and if they're not performing to expectations, we'll close those.","I think the bigger conversation around universal branches though is universal branch has a set definition in terms of the configuration and the approach, but what we've learned is that the psychology and the method of interacting with our customers can be just as effective in our traditional branch format. So it's sort of an alternative format approach which can include our universal branches and also some of our legacy branches.","William Demchak","So in effect we change the role and mix of employees to have more people customer-facing and less tellers, but we don't spend a 50 to 100 grand to redo the branch.","Robert Reilly","That's right.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thanks.","William Demchak","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Terry McEvoy","Hi, thanks. Good morning. First question, CRE was flat to down a bit in 2017. Could you just talk about any pay down activity in the fourth quarter? And then just your overall appetite and opportunities for growth in 2019?","Robert Reilly","You mean 2018, right?","Terry McEvoy","2018, yes, sorry.","Robert Reilly","On the CRE in 2017 is much of what Bill is saying. The originations actually were pretty strong. It was more sort of the take outs that were elevated, particularly in the second half of the year. I think going into 2018, we still see some growth, but not at the rate that we've seen in the last couple of years.","Terry McEvoy","Thanks. Sorry about that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy. Please proceed with your question.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning, guys.","William Demchak","Hey Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","I have to jump over the call for a minute, so I apologize if you addressed this. On capital return, obviously your stock has done very well in the last 18 months. And with the new regulators, I know in the past there seem to be some hesitancy by the regulators to allow banks to do special dividends as part of their capital return. But Bill, what\u2019s your thinking if you kind of get the sign from the regulators that they would be supportive of that? How do you wrestle with that versus buying back your stock at elevated prices or amount of valuation basis relative to a special dividend?","William Demchak","Well, rather than talk about special or non-special, I think the simple answer is, given the price to book ratios for us in the industry at this point, our bias would be towards dividends versus buyback, but we still have a pretty healthy buyback. We did get the question, I sort of said the margin given the increased cash flow because of the lower tax rate, our bias would be to push that towards dividend as opposed to increase buyback. And all of that is kind of common sense, given where valuations are.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And I know over the years that you guys have been an asset-sensitive bank, of course. And if we assume that this tax reform leads to stronger economic growth in 2018 and 2019, which would probably imply higher interest rates, how are you guys thinking about the balance sheet? Are you keeping at the way it is or maybe making it more asset sensitive, less asset sensitive?","William Demchak","Well, look the theory isn't \u2013 and the theory is simple, the practice is hard, right. You get limit long in effect just prior to going into our recession and we\u2019ve been asset sensitive or very short as the economy has been recovering with the rates going up with the added fuel of the fiscal stimulus in effect coming from the tax program. You will see us leg in and close some of our negative duration over time.","One of the things I mentioned, it's \u2013 the windfall in carry terms as opposed to value terms from that is less than it once was simply because the yield curve is flattened. But we will close that gap as \u2013 beyond an earnings measure as a pure risk management measure once as we sort of approach the \u2013 I\u2019ll call it the maturity of this economic run.","Robert Reilly","We've done some of that already.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Thank you, guys.","Robert Reilly","Yes. Thanks Gerard.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Betsy Graseck","Hey, thanks so much. Bill just wanted to follow-up on your comments around the cost of equity moving up a bit because the tax shield is going down, could you just give a little color there and how you think about adjusting the cost of equity from what to what?","William Demchak","Well, I mean without putting numbers on it, it's a mathematical calculation, right, so our tax shield on our percentage of debt as a part of our mix funding bases is not less. By the way that\u2019s theory and practice often differs from theory. We look at it. The reason I bring it up is we measure our client relationships on our own performance as a function of total capital used to pursue a relationship and capital committed through credit and operating risk capital and so forth. So my only point in sort of bringing that whole thing up is there's offsetting costs and effect to simply saying that we could take the entire tax benefit and competed away without effective in business through our cost of capital.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. I wasn't sure if you were also suggesting that the credit risk that you're taking in your core business is also a little bit risky because there's less tax shield associated with that as well.","William Demchak","No I wasn't implying that, although, if you really wanted to get into the math, the actual economic capital and credit increases in a lower tax environment, but I won't bore you with what that is.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Maybe offline you can bore me, I'd be happy if you bore with that conversation. The second question was just on the CIP target. I know it's lower than last year, so should we be interpreting that as, hey there is where \u2013 as we do more there's less to harvest or is there also a implication there of \u2013 there isn't a ramp up in other areas of investment spend?","Robert Reilly","No, I think it's the former just by definition in each year we get more and more efficient by definition, there's less in total to get, but that's still a significant number, it\u2019s baked into our guidance in terms of total expense guidance and it's a tool we've used to keep expenses in check for what build last five years.","William Demchak","Yes, we don't mix that with our investment. We used to fund our investment, but that's sort of a number that we focus on internally in terms of costs we're just taking out. Part of what's happening is we've hit most of the easy things in the longer-term opportunity we have and we've talked about this is kind of through automation in our back offices and some of the work we're doing in the home lending transformation. There will be more work in retail and then all the work we're doing in AI and RPA. But that's sort of a longer-term opportunity that's going to probably play out over a number of years as opposed to something we could quantify this year.","Betsy Graseck","Right. Okay. And does the tax law change help you with ramping that investment spend up a little bit maybe?","William Demchak","Our guidance for 2018 is our guidance for 2018. In theory we could invest more, but as you've heard us say we haven't been shy about it \u2013 future of our company, and oftentimes our decision to invest and take on new opportunities is driven by as much by our ability to execute efficiently as it is. They have dollars to spend.","Robert Reilly","And some of the sequencing that's necessary for that.","William Demchak","Yes.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Kenneth Usdin","Thanks. Hey, good morning, guys. Also thanks again for that Slide 7, really helpful. Just a couple of clean up things just on the full-year outlook. Rob, if I presume that your total revenue is a non-FTE basis and it's all inclusive, can you help us understand are you baking in that 250 to 300 for other not just for the first quarter, but all the way through the year?","Robert Reilly","Yes, we are.","Kenneth Usdin","Okay. Got it.","Robert Reilly","We can provide that guidance in that line, but that guidance hasn\u2019t changed for quarter-to-quarter for a long time.","Kenneth Usdin","Even though last year it was largely above it for most of the year.","Robert Reilly","Yes. It was largely above it last year and most of that was as I had mentioned in previous calls, Ken, we've spoken about it, how it performs really in our private equity business.","Kenneth Usdin","Understood. Which could continue good markets.","Robert Reilly","Which could continue, but we normalize that a bit in our outlook.","Kenneth Usdin","Understood. Okay, got it. And then secondly just on credit, you're kind of keeping to this 150 \u2013 100 to 150, just wonder if you could just talk about just your outlook for credit within your outlook for the year, but also especially given that we might get some additional help on the tax stuff on corporate America and consumer America, just your overall views of credit quality and how you'd be thinking of that?","Robert Reilly","I think it's pretty stable as I mentioned in the opening comments there, Ken, so we feel good about the book on the consumer side. We're largely in the prime space and the consumer is pretty healthy. And then on the corporate space credit has been pretty good, as you can see particularly in this quarter and as you say with a lower tax rate is that results in these corporate even going up in credit quality that will be better, but that remains to be same.","Kenneth Usdin","Okay. Last little one, in the fees comment you mentioned high single-digits for asset management, does that also presume that double benefit you'll get from the BlackRock pulling through off of there expected higher gap income as well?","Robert Reilly","Yes, it does. Yes it does.","Kenneth Usdin","Okay, understood. All right, thanks guys. Appreciate it.","Robert Reilly","Yes, you bet Ken.","William Demchak","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin Barker","Thank you. Within your guidance you mentioned that you have three rate hikes for combined with a slightly flattening yield curve given the outlook? Could you just give us a little bit of color around assume that yield curve stays where it is? Where the [two tens] spread is just over 50 base points or you are saying further flattening from where we are right now?","Robert Reilly","In terms of our\u2026","William Demchak","I think it is a practical matter. I think the flattening trade at least as it relates to two tens is probably over the carry trade with the very front end with three rate increases as we have in our forecast is going to affect, drop the carry that I think will get from a typical investment portfolio. So we would see flattening trend from Fed funds to 10 years probably continue it.","Robert Reilly","By definition...","William Demchak","Well not by definition, but practically, yes.","Robert Reilly","Yes.","Kevin Barker","Right and given shorter duration of your balance sheet and the outside amount of liquidity compared to peers, we should benefit from the shorter and moving higher rate?","William Demchak","So the shorter and going higher increases yield on what is by majority floating rate loan book. Value ultimately we remain short on a duration basis, so we will invest in the fixed rate securities and swaps, the carry from that at least on initiation of the transaction will be less than what it once was is the curve flattens from our cost of funding to whatever maturity we put on the loan book.","Kevin Barker","Okay, and then a follow-up on your comment regarding the system implementations and acceleration of consumer loan growth. You mentioned as you got that the mortgage piece finalized on the new platform today and that the home equity and few other products will follow up in 2018? It seems these are couple quarters later than normal. Is that was there a little bit of delay in the implementation of that and would that a little bit of a headwind and your projections for consumer loan growth in 2018?","William Demchak","I mean it\u2019s a practical matter that the entirety of the project to redo home lending was harder than we thought longer than we thought cost more money that we thought. So yes, yes and yes having said that it's all in what we've given you as guidance and we remain pretty bullish on what we can do inside of the home lending platform, home equity and mortgage on the same originations system with the strong digital front end, which has been a lot of work to get there.","Robert Reilly","And the time place it\u2019s all built into our guidance from the timeframe at the end of 2018 as what we've been talking about for some time.","Kevin Barker","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Mayo","Hi, Bill.","William Demchak","Hi, Mike.","Mike Mayo","I would like to challenge you on one point that you made and that is that you would bore us with the cost of capital discussion.","William Demchak","Not the cost of capital that \u2013 we had a debate internally on what the lower tax rates actually do to the economic capital units that you prescribe to a given loan and the reason that the capital goes up is because you in effect in a fat-tail distribution lose the downside tax shield. That's the boring nature of it. If you take it offline, but in effect if I had 10 units of capital for 100 units of loan at yield tax rate, I have 10.5 or 11 today.","Mike Mayo","A conceptually kind of makes sense, again where it's not boring to \u2013 we're a bunch of bank analysts, its interesting Bill.","William Demchak","Right. Right.","Mike Mayo","But let's take that further as far as the impact of the lower taxes on corporate credit and it seems like you could be guiding for a faster loan growth than you are. Do you expect this change to increase corporate loan growth? Do you expect the CapEx cycle to change because of the tax change? Are you budgeting more people or resources for that demand? Or do you think it's going to be kind of beyond?","William Demchak","I don't know that we would need to budget more resources if that happens. That's terrific. I think at the margin, if you just play this out, if I\u2019m a corporate manager, I'm going to have more projects that meet my hurdle in terms of investments than I did before at the margin.","In practice, you need to fund those. Now they have more cash flow to fund those than they had before. But there's probably a willingness and a desire and a need to borrow as well. The other thing that we have that we don't really have our arms around yet is of course the cash repatriation coming back out of Europe.","Now as a practical matter most of those people aren't the people who have been borrowing anyway. So I don't know that that has a material impact on dampening credit. So I guess long-winded answer, all else equal, stronger economy, tax code, change audit, increased loan demand. We haven't built that into our guidance. I think at the same time we see sort of record type in active corporate bond markets, which would be some of an offset to what we see on the loan side.","Robert Reilly","And that\u2019s just what we know today.","William Demchak","Yes. Look if that happens, I mean you know how we do this, if that happens as terrific, but that isn\u2019t in our guidance.","Mike Mayo","And you alluded to this before. Do you think credit gets better than you thought it would be otherwise without the tax cut?","William Demchak","There's more cash flow, so all else equal. If people don't lever up as a function of it, there's trade offs, but all else equal, notwithstanding the fact that we're kind of at all time high leverage for particularly investment-grade corporate America. This is going to generate cash flow that the margin ought to help them.","Mike Mayo","And then last question just on the boring part, what is your cost to capital? What do you think about it and how has that changed over the past few years?","William Demchak","I'm not going to get into that. We measure it \u2013 as a practical matter. We look at it every quarter out for a number of different things. I don't actually know what it is this quarter.","Robert Reilly","We can get to you on that Mike. We haven\u2019t calculated it down.","Mike Mayo","It sounds good. All right, thanks a lot.","William Demchak","Yes.","End of Q&A","Operator","And we\u2019re showing no further questions on the audio lines at this time.","William Demchak","Okay. Well listen, thank you, everybody. Look forward to talking to you again in the first quarter and for a strong 2018.","Robert Reilly","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

My name is Nelson, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The PNC Financial Services Group Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bryan Gill. Please go ahead, sir.","Bryan Gill","Yeah. Thank you, Nelson, and good morning. Welcome to today\u2019s conference call for The PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on the call are PNC\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today\u2019s presentation contains forward-looking information. Our forward-looking statements regarding PNC performance assume a continuation of the current economic trends and do not take into account the impact of potential, legal and regulatory contingencies. Actual results and future events could differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in our statements and from historical performance due to a variety of risks and other factors.","Information about such factors, as well as GAAP reconciliations and other information on non-GAAP financial measures we discuss, is included in today\u2019s conference call, earnings release and related presentation materials and in our 10-K, 10-Qs and various other SEC filings and investor materials. Well, these are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of January 13, 2017, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bill Demchak.","Bill Demchak","Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everybody. As you have seen today we reported full year 2016 results with net income of $4 billion or $7.30 per diluted common share. You should have also seen our tangible book value at year end was $67.41 per common share. All-in, \u201916 was a pretty solid year for PNC, we grew net interest and fee income, we kept expenses essentially flat and we were -- returned more than $3 billion in capital to shareholders, and importantly, we grew our customer franchise.","Now, all that said, our net income finished slightly below 2015, in part due to our disciplined risk management efforts throughout the year to best position PNC in the current credit and interest rate environment. As we have learned over and over again through time, our business offers very attractive returns and growth opportunities by effectively managing through the cycles that are inherent to the banking industry.","In our view for the most part of \u201916 neither the credit, and certainly, not the rate markets offered us an attractive risk or reward opportunity. So we maintained higher than usual cash balances and our loan growth trailed peers.","Now as I discussed in depth at a number of investor conferences in the last few months, we continue to invest and make important progress against our strategic priorities. We are particularly pleased with the progress that we have made on modernizing our core technology infrastructure and building a leading banking franchise in the Southeast.","As we look ahead, our current indicators suggest improving confidence amongst consumers and business leaders about the direction of economy, which could bode well for our industry. There is also growing sentiment that we are entering a period of rising rate -- rising interest rates. In addition, we've all heard that the new administration of Washington supports tax reform, regulatory relief and other pro-growth policies.","But so far, our moving interest rates is the only thing that is actually happened with the apparent likelihood of more of this to come this year, but should some or all of these things come to pass, it would certainly benefit us and the industry as a whole.","Now as always, though we remain focused on the things that are actually in our power to control and I am confident that the actions that we took in \u201816 position us for further growth and to continue to create long-term value for our shareholders. But 2017 is an important year for us as we execute on a number of initiatives including the home lending transformation, the ongoing digitization of the retail capabilities, stronger growth in consumer lending, international expansion of our middle market lending franchise.","And with that, I am going to hand it over to Rob who will run you through the numbers and share with you some guidance for [2017] and then we would be happy to take your questions. Rob?","Rob Reilly","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Overall, our full year and fourth quarter results were largely consistent with our expectations. As Bill just mentioned, our full year net income was $4 billion or $7.30 per diluted common share and fourth quarter net income was a $1 billion or $1.97 per diluted common share.","Our balance sheet information is on slide four and it's presented on an average basis. Total loans grew by $2 billion or 1% linked-quarter. Commercial lending was up $1.7 billion or 1% from the third quarter, primarily in our corporate banking and real estate businesses. Consumer lending increased approximately $300 million compared to the third quarter and by approximately $800 million excluding our consumer runoff portfolios. Our consumer loan growth was in auto, residential mortgage and credit card.","For the full year-over-year quarter, we had total loan growth of $4.9 billion or 2%. Commercial lending increased by $6.1 billion or 5% from growth in large corporate and commercial real estate loans and consumer lending was down $1.2 billion or 2% year-over-year, primarily due to the continued decline in our consumer runoff portfolios.","Investment securities were up $4.4 billion or 6% linked-quarter, primarily in U.S. Treasuries and increased $8.2 billion or 12% compared to the same quarter a year ago, as we continue to grow balances in conjunction with higher rates.","On a spot basis, investment securities decreased $2.6 billion or 3% compared to September 30th. Our securities purchased in the fourth quarter were more than offset by repayments and negative valuation adjustments due to rising rates. Importantly, about half of the securities purchased in the fourth quarter were forward settling and will be reflected in the first quarter of 2017.","On a liability side, total deposits increased by $4.5 billion or 2% when compared to the third quarter, primarily driven by seasonally higher commercial deposits and continued growth in consumer savings products. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, total deposits increased by $10.1 billion or 4% as we continue to see strong growth in demand and savings deposits.","Average common shareholders\u2019 equity decreased by approximately $100 million linked-quarter, primarily due to a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of a change in the value of our available-for-sale securities book from the rising rate environment. At December 31, 2016, AOCI was down $837 million, compared to September 30, 2016.","Compared to the same quarter a year ago, average common shareholders\u2019 equity increased $700 million, even after continued capital return to shareholders and the impact of AOCI. For full year 2016, our capital return totaled $3.1 billion, comprised of $2 billion in share repurchases and $1.1 billion in common dividends. This resulted in a payout ratio of approximately 85%.","Period-end common shares outstanding were $485 million, down $19 million or 4% compared to the year end 2015. As of December 31, 2016, our pro forma Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio fully phased-in and using the standardized approach was estimated to be 10%, a decline of 20 basis points from September 30, 2016, primarily due to the decline in AOCI.","Our tangible book value was $67.41 per common share as of December 31st and although this declined on a linked-quarter basis reflecting the impact of AOCI, it was up 6% compared to the same date a year ago and our return on average assets for the fourth quarter was 1.13%.","As I\u2019ve already mentioned and as you can see on slide five, net income was $4 billion for the full year and a $1 billion for the fourth quarter. Highlights include the following, fourth quarter revenue was up $45 million or 1% compared to the third quarter. This was driven by higher net interest income, which increased $35 million or 2%, primarily due to higher average securities and loan balances, as well as higher loan yields. Non-interest income was up $10 million or 1%, as lower fee income was offset by higher other income.","Full year revenue was stable, as higher net interest income was offset by lower non-interest income, principally due to the decline in net Visa activity. Of note, we do not sell any Visa shares in the second half of 2016.","Expenses continue to be well-managed in the fourth quarter. Non-interest expense was up $47 million or 2% compared to the third quarter and included a $55 million contribution to the PNC Foundation. For full year 2016, expenses were stable compared with 2015.","Provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter was $67 million, down $20 million linked-quarter as overall credit quality remained stable. Fully year provision of $433 million increased by $178 million compared to 2015, largely reflecting the impact of energy-related loans, primarily during the first half of the year.","Finally, our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 23.4% and our full year effective tax rate was 24.1%, both periods were impacted by the tax favorability of the contribution to the PNC Foundation. Looking ahead, we expect our 2017 effective tax rate to be approximately 25% to 26%, which doesn\u2019t take into account any tax reform. Now, I will discuss the key drivers of our performance in more detail.","Turning to slide six, full year 2016 net interest income increased by $113 million or 1% compared to 2015, reflecting higher core NII. Core net interest income grew by $254 million or 3% in 2016, primarily driven by increased loan and securities balances, and higher loan yields. Core NII increased to $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter, which was the highest quarterly level we generated in three years.","In 2016, purchase accounting accretion decreased to $141 million. In 2017, we expect PAA will be down by $75 million compared to 2016. Net interest margin stabilized in 2016 and NIM improved slightly in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter due to higher loan yields.","As you can see on slide seven, we have successfully grown fee income in each of the past five years and our diversified businesses continue to produce substantial fee income throughout 2016. Three of our business activities, asset management, corporate and consumer services each generate well in excess of a $1 billion annually and we continue to execute on our strategies to grow these fee businesses across our franchise.","For the full year, asset management fees, which include our equity investment in BlackRock declined $46 million or 3% as net new business activity was more than offset by a $30 million trust settlement in 2015, and the impact of volatile equity markets in the first quarter of 2016. On a linked-quarter basis, asset management fees declined slightly as the impact of higher equity markets was offset by lower fixed income markets and lower net new business activity.","Consumer services fees grew $53 million or 4% for the full year as a result of higher and increasingly broad customer activity, with growth in credit and debit card, as well as increased brokerage fees. On a linked-quarter basis, consumer services fees increased modestly reflecting slightly higher credit card activity.","Corporate services fees increased by $13 million or 1% in 2016 and included higher treasury management fees partially offset by lower merger and acquisition advisory fees. Treasury management is one of our largest corporate services fees components and we see long-term growth opportunities as we continue to develop innovative solutions in the corporate payment space.","On a linked-quarter basis, corporate services fees were relatively flat as lower merger and acquisition advisory fees offset a higher benefit from commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation.","Residential mortgage noninterest income was stable for the full year 2016 as, I\u2019m sorry, was stable for the full year as 2016 originations slightly exceeded 2015 levels. On a linked-quarter basis, residential mortgage fees were down $18 million or 11% as loan sales revenue declined due to higher rates and seasonally lower loan application and origination volumes in the fourth quarter.","Service charges on deposits for the full year increased by $16 million or 2% driven by higher customer activity. On a linked-quarter basis, service charges on deposits declined seasonally by 1%.","Lastly, full year other noninterest income decreased by $213 million or 16%, primarily due to lower asset sales compared to 2015. The largest component was net Visa sales activity, which declined by $134 million year-over-year.","On a linked-quarter basis, other noninterest income increased by $36 million or 14%, primarily driven by higher gains on asset dispositions and higher revenue from private equity and other investments. In 2017, we expect the quarterly run rate for other noninterest income to be in the range of $250 million to $275 million, excluding net securities gains and net Visa activity.","Turning to slide eight, as you know, expense management has been a particular focus area for us for several years. Since 2012, we have successfully reduced annual expenses by more than a $1 billion, even as we made significant investments in our technology infrastructure and our retail bank transformation. These results were due in part to our continuous improvement program or CIP.","During 2016, we completed actions that achieved our full year goal of $400 million in cost savings. Looking forward to 2017, we have targeted an additional $350 million in cost saving through CIP, which we again expect to fund a significant portion of our business and technology investments.","Turning to slide nine, overall credit quality remained stable in the fourth quarter. Total nonperforming loans were essentially flat linked-quarter, as improvements in commercial NPLs were mostly offset by increases on the consumer side. Total delinquencies increased by $120 million or 8%, primarily in the 30-day to 59-day period, which was due to some seasonal factors that had since then resolved.","Provision for credit losses of $67 million decreased by $20 million linked-quarter, the provision with slightly lower than our expectations, due in part to a reserve release related to better than expected performance of home equity lines of credit that are reaching their draw period end date. As many of you are aware and as we have expected for some time, the home equity end of draws will peak in 2017.","Net charge-offs declined $48 million to $106 million in the fourth quarter, as our energy-related net charge-offs decreased. In the fourth quarter, the annualized net charge-off ratio was 20 basis points, down 9 basis points linked-quarter.","In summary, PNC reported fourth quarter and full year earnings consistent with our expectations. Turning to 2017, we expect continued steady growth in GDP and a corresponding increase in short-term interest rates twice this year, in June and December, with each increase being 25 basis points.","Based on these assumptions, our full year 2017 guidance compared to 2016 results is as follows. We expect mid single-digit loan growth, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits and we expect the low single-digit increase in expenses. Based on this guidance, we believe we will deliver positive operating leverage in 2017 and believe we can do so absent our expectations for short-term interest rate increases.","Looking ahead at the first quarter of 2017, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 reported results, we expect modest loan growth, we expect total net interest income to remain stable, we expect fee income to be down mid-single digits due to seasonality and typically lower first quarter client activity, we expect expenses to be down low single digits and we expect provision to be between $75 million and a $125 million.","And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.","Bryan Gill","Operator, could you please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Please proceed.","Scott Siefers","Good morning, guys.","Bill Demchak","Hi, Scott.","Scott Siefers","With the -- either Bill or Rob, something you could just sort of address the idea of the pace at which you would anticipate deploying liquidity favor the course of the year can be, I guess, I can get a directional sense for what you\u2019ve been doing in the earning asset base, but just curious kind of philosophically how are you thinking about legging into higher interest rates as we look throughout 2017?","Bill Demchak","I mean, look, there is no magical answer to that. Through the course of the last bunch of years even with rates largely flat inside of kind of up and down cycles. We invest opportunistically small bets, we remain very short today, so we have a big opportunity, but we are not going to bet on red all-in sort of one rate move. So you will see us through the course of the year if rates continue their path and what we expect to deploy liquidity and reduce our asset sensitivity, but there is no perfect answer to that, it certainly isn\u2019t programmatic.","Scott Siefers","Okay. And then maybe skipping over to the sort of the volume side of the NII equitation, the -- I think the first quarter guidance is still for more modest growth than you got the stronger growth outlook for the full year on overall loan growth. Just curious how you see things building as it relates to overall loan growth in some of the actual favorable impact of some of these new initiatives on both equity, consumer and commercial sides?","Rob Reilly","Yeah. Well, this, as it relates to the first quarter issue on NII, I mean, that\u2019s largely a day count issue, where we had two days.","Bill Demchak","On the NII, yeah, they are stable\u2026","Rob Reilly","Yeah. Yeah.","Bill Demchak","\u2026so loans are...","Rob Reilly","So, back that out, I mean, loans just in terms of our guidance, we kind of assume flat across the year. But I would tell you inside of that we have kind of continued fourth quarter pace for C&I and we have kind of continued fourth quarter pace for what we had in consumer. Inside of consumers, we\u2019ve got a number of initiatives that ought to allow us to accelerate that through time, not changing our credit back so much, it\u2019s just improving our process.","And inside of C&I, a couple of sound bites. December was the highest sales month ever for our corporate bank. The fourth quarter inside of middle markets, the first quarter and multiple quarters where we actually had growth in plain vanilla middle market loans.","Scott Siefers","Okay.","Rob Reilly","And so, maybe we\u2019re doing a great job, but maybe some of the sentiment you\u2019re hearing and feeling coming out of corporate America actually plays out and what we have in our forecast didn\u2019t really build in that impact. So, there\u2019s probably upside to that and the consumer piece, there is upside to too, but that plays out over the course of years, frankly, as we change technology, operations and some of the way we go about approving things.","Bill Demchak","And that consumer lift probably being more, just to the spirit of your question, more on the back half of 2017 than in the first quarter.","Rob Reilly","Yeah. Yeah.","Scott Siefers","Yeah. It makes sense. Okay. Perfect. Thanks guys very much.","Bill Demchak","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. Good morning.","Rob Reilly","Hi, Betsy.","Bill Demchak","Good morning.","Betsy Graseck","Couple of questions, one on expenses, I see the 350 CIP target. Can you just talk about whether or not there is an opportunity to dropping that to the bottomline, I mean, I saw the guidance for next year with expenses -- expense expectation in the low single digits, but wondered if that includes the CIP and so the result is that you\u2019re not dropping into the bottomline or am I misunderstanding something?","Rob Reilly","No, no. I think you\u2019re -- hi, Betsy, this Rob. You\u2019re doing it correctly. Our full year guidance were up a bit on expenses incorporates the 350 CIP. And what we\u2019re looking to do in 2017 is what we\u2019ve been doing these last couple of years. A specific list of cost saves that in effect will fund the investments that we intend to continue to make. On top of that, with some growth that we have on some variable expenses around growth and fee businesses would be part of that as well.","Bill Demchak","Yeah. The other thing is that, \u201817 takes the full impact of the FDIC rolling charge. So, some of it is sort of just carry forward from what we were taking through 2016 and there is a little bit of imbalance in there, as it relates to some of our longer term initiatives. For example, the savings will get out of home lending and the savings will get out of decommissioning data centers, which will start to show up in \u201817, but carry forward into later years.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. That makes sense.","Bill Demchak","Yeah. So it\u2019s all embedded in the expense guidance but...","Rob Reilly","Yeah.","Bill Demchak","... I think my point is a simple one which is we haven\u2019t nor we\u2019ll ever lose site of the goal of holding expenses as tightly controlled as we can.","Rob Reilly","And in check.","Bill Demchak","Yeah.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. But what I\u2019m also hearing is a little bit of backend improvement expected?","Bill Demchak","That depends -- it depends what happens to volumes and the comp side of that.","Rob Reilly","Yeah. I mean, I think, the best way to think of that, I think, that\u2019s partially true. I mean, as you know, our goal is positive operating leverage. We\u2019re definitively in a position where we feel we\u2019ll deliver that and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to manage to.","Betsy Graseck","And then just secondly on the tax question, there\u2019s obviously been a lot of chatter around potentially having a lower tax rate. I know there is a tremendous amount of puts and takes until we get to the end state. But could you just speak broadly to whether or not changes in tax policy would impact how you\u2019re thinking about the stake you have in BlackRock?","Rob Reilly","Well, look, so we\u2019ll go back and restate what we said 25 times, which is we\u2019re rationale stewards of your capital as it relates to our holding in BlackRock, obviously, a lower tax burden on disposition changes the economics on that, without knowing tax rate...","Bill Demchak","Right.","Rob Reilly","... or any other things that may play through it\u2019s hard to predict how that plays out. But look it changes the economics and we\u2019re conscious of that and we\u2019ll take that into account if and when we get to something that\u2019s actually made...","Bill Demchak","On that variable.","Rob Reilly","Yeah.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Got it. Thanks.","Rob Reilly","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Erika Najarian","Hi. Good morning.","Bill Demchak","Good morning.","Erika Najarian","Just as I take a step back, clearly, a lot of change since we\u2019ve talked to you last. Can you give us a sense of how much regulatory costs have increased over the past few years for PNC and what you think the natural trajectory is of those regulatory costs and how the trajectory could potentially change if we do have some regulatory relief?","Bill Demchak","You can start.","Rob Reilly","Sure. I can start. Erika, this is Rob. I don\u2019t have a definitive number to throw out at you in terms of what the regulatory costs are. I know there are lot. But we gave up a few years ago, just because counting it because it became so ingrained in everything that we did. To answer your question in terms of, if that were to change, would we be able to reduce expenses, I suppose, although there are a lot of things that we\u2019re doing that are sensible that we would continue to do.","My mind -- when you asked that question my mind just jumps sort of the opportunity cost if at all. The regulatory work that we do is very time-consuming in terms of management\u2019s time, calories, et cetera, that in theory could be applied to other endeavors. Bill, do you have anything to add to that?","Bill Demchak","No. The only other thing I\u2019d say is that, that the regulatory burden as it relates to, if you\u2019re thinking CCAR or heightened expectations or three lines of defense, they are certainly a lot of that, much of which by the way, we would keep and go through the exercise anyway. But there\u2019s also a lot of regulatory costs that probably were missing from the industry historically. I\u2019m thinking about to build an AML costs as we put bodies in operations and investment technologies as it relates to AML. I\u2019m thinking about general compliance with consumer laws, independent of where and what happens to the CFPB, it\u2019s clear that that we all had work to do on that. We are done investing in that by and large, but I don\u2019t think those costs go away, no matter nor should they, no matter what really happens to the regulation.","Rob Reilly","[Ph] In a material way (27:55)","Bill Demchak","Yeah.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And just a follow-up to clarify the guidance on revenues, the up mid-single digit, what is the backdrop from a rate perspective Rob that you are assuming?","Rob Reilly","So, yeah, so on the revenue side, up mid-single digits, again around the loan growth that we have there. The rate backdrop, as I\u2019ve mentioned, we have built into our plans two rate increases in 2017, one in June and one in December both 25 basis points.","Bill Demchak","That\u2019s clearly the one in June is the only one that matters.","Rob Reilly","Right.","Bill Demchak","But what also matters is we are assuming sort of a rational forward curve off of\u2026","Rob Reilly","Yes.","Bill Demchak","\u2026 rates today in the sense that our reinvestment of our securities book assumes continued higher five-year through seven-year part of the curve, where that\u2019s a flat and substantially then it wouldn\u2019t -- the impact wouldn\u2019t be as great.","Rob Reilly","Yeah. That\u2019s right. And of course, both rate increases matters but June matters more to 2017.","Bill Demchak","Yes.","Erika Najarian","Great. Thanks so much. I appreciate it.","Rob Reilly","Yeah. Sure.","Bill Demchak","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please proceed.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning, guys.","Rob Reilly","Hey, Gerard.","Bill Demchak","Good morning.","Gerard Cassidy","Rob, coming back to your comments about the technology infrastructure spending that you\u2019ve been doing for a number years now?","Rob Reilly","Yeah.","Gerard Cassidy","Is there a period, where you think that extra spending, if there is extra spending going on that ends and you start to see that kind of flat now, maybe even come down in total technology spending?","Bill Demchak","Yes. We\u2019re looking at each other here. So the infrastructure spend most definitely falls off substantially and I would see a technology plan given to me that would suggest total tech cost would fall. Having said that, my expectation is that it\u2019s not true, instead what happen is you\u2019ll see a mix shift, such that we\u2019re spending much more on the frontend towards consumers and applications and ease of doing business and automation and real-time payments, and less worrying about the infrastructure.","The infrastructure we build supports our capability to do the second order effect, but I think, banking both on the corporate and retail side is increasingly becoming a technology-related business, and I just don\u2019t know that you\u2019re going to see that drop-off a few and tend to remain competitive with what customers expect today.","Rob Reilly","Yeah. Hey, Gerard. This is Rob. I\u2019ll answer that. That\u2019s the key point. It\u2019s a shift from the build out on the infrastructure to actually using the infrastructure and we have a lot of investments planned around various customer applications.","Gerard Cassidy","I see. And is the infrastructure spend, does that finish up end of this year into next year or any timetable?","Bill Demchak","No. It\u2019s pretty much done this year. We\u2019ll have some trailing effects and we\u2019ll obviously continuously be investing in cyber and then we\u2019ll have a roll forward of the take down of the old data centers, which actually take some period of time, as you sort of decommission and clean old servers, so some of the expense that rolls into \u201918.","Rob Reilly","Right.","Bill Demchak","But the infrastructure side, absent cyber, which will be continuous, is largely behind us now.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then, Bill, maybe -- can you give us any color on where we stand on [ph] Zell (31:41) being rolled out this quarter? What your expectations are for this year and how business could or the PDP spending could help your consumer business?","Bill Demchak","So, I\u2019m cognizant of not wanting to front run public analysis...","Gerard Cassidy","Okay.","Bill Demchak","... from Zell themselves, but assume that sometime early in 2017, right. The collective of banks that have signed up early on, which include the ownership structure, as well as a number of other large banks and many other banks through third-party service providers will be online with Zell. It will be ubiquitous, you\u2019ll be able to use it on PNC\u2019s mobile app or BofA\u2019s or Citigroup\u2019s or Morgan\u2019s or anybody else\u2019s.","And I think, it does a couple of things, one is, it puts our consumers back in our hands, right. The whole idea behind is, we don\u2019t want our customers using third-party application, particularly in what potentially is insecure -- in unsecure fashion. So, solves that issues and then, it gives us mindshare. It\u2019s not a revenue opportunity out of the gate as it relates to the product specifically. But I think it is another part of the customer relationship that makes it more sticky.","And I think through time, the concept of real-time payments, whether P2P or business-to-consumer or on the corporate side, it\u2019s where we\u2019re rolling out real-time payments through the clearing houses is alternative to ACH.","I think it becomes stable stakes. I think there is revenue opportunities against it. I think the U.S. is behind and I think it\u2019s a trend you\u2019re going to continue to see build and on the back of it, you will see, I know we have many product applications that we are developing on the\u2026","Gerard Cassidy","Yeah.","Bill Demchak","\u2026 back of that basic capability, which will be revenue driven.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Appreciate all the color.","Rob Reilly","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Rob Reilly","Hi, John.","Bill Demchak","Hi, John.","John Pancari","Just on the BlackRock stake, just given the potential corporate tax reform, one of the, see if you can give us your updated thoughts on how you\u2019re thinking about the stake and if you could look at a potential sale here, and if so, if you could just talk about the capital deployment opportunities, how you would view that? Thanks.","Bill Demchak","Yeah. Well, the rude answer would be -- has been answered, but I\u2019ll answer it again quickly. The -- our thoughts on BlackRock remain the same, which is we\u2019ll be an intelligent owner of valuable position of the company that we\u2019ve done very well through time and it\u2019s been a good partner.","We look for ways, if there are ways to monetize that stake, we recognized the concentration of it, we would do so. A lower tax rate changes the economics of a potential sale, but there\u2019s nothing on a sheet of paper, no law, no new rate, that allows us to run any numbers that suggest what we would or\u2026","Rob Reilly","Yeah.","Bill Demchak","\u2026 wouldn\u2019t do other than we\u2019ll be rationale actors in the right environment.","John Pancari","Okay. Thank you. Yes. Sorry, I just realized, Betsy, had asked that. And then, on that -- in terms of the -- your thoughts on M&A as you look at things. I know you\u2019ve been reserved in terms of your outlook there, are you feeling any different here as you look into next year or this year? Thanks.","Bill Demchak","Not on the bank side, for the all reasons mentioned before that, we don\u2019t want to buy yesterday\u2019s sort of bank model and we don\u2019t have a need for scale. Having said that, we continue to look at I\u2019ll call them portfolio purchases, but asset generators that would make sense inside of our franchise and would add another product or service to an existing client base, we look at those all the time, we haven\u2019t hit on it, but it wouldn\u2019t shock me if we did.","John Pancari","Okay. And if I could throw one more in there\u2026","Bill Demchak","Yeah.","John Pancari","On the HELOC loans coming in better than expected in terms of their performance, is that something that you expect to continue through the year?","Rob Reilly","Premature, John, I mean, that\u2019s going to be an issue for us in 2017, premature to conclude that. This is something, as I mentioned in the opening comments, we pointed to for sometime 2017 was the peak year. So, we\u2019ll obviously keep a close eye on it, but premature to conclude anything yet.","John Pancari","All right, Rob. All right. Thank you.","Rob Reilly","Sure.","Bill Demchak","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, guys. This is [ph] Rob (36:47) from Matt\u2019s team. Just to follow-up on your full year revenue growth guidance in the mid-single-digits, asked another way, any sense of what that would look like ex any rate increases through the year and then looking at the components of that, any sense of growth expectations for fee revenues and then net interest income for the year?","Rob Reilly","Rob, it\u2019s Rob. Yeah, I mean, I think, the simplest way to answer that Rob would be sort of what\u2019s the value in terms of our revenue guidance of effectively the June rate increase that we built into our plan. There is the December too, but as we just mentioned that won\u2019t have as big of an impact.","And all else being equal, which not all else will be equal, but just for math purposes, we value that around $170 million to $200 million of revenue. So, if you wanted to put that into your model or back that out, that sort of answers your fundamental question.","In terms of just sort of mid single-digit growth, I think, you just take a look in terms of what we would reasonably expect in terms of securities balances, the loans that we talked about and continued fee growth and they all sort of converge at that mid single-digit level.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thanks so much.","Rob Reilly","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed.","KenUsdin","Thanks a lot. Good morning. Hey, Rob, can I just ask one more on the cost side?","Rob Reilly","Yeah. Sure.","Ken Usdin","You mentioned that inside the 350 CIP for the year, you\u2019re now contemplating some of these -- the multiple ongoing initiatives you guys got. So, is it fair to say that as we do roll forward that whether it\u2019s the data center stuff or the tech rationalization, branches, your home equity, that\u2019s all contemplated in your annual CIP as we now forward, at one point in the conference\u2026","Rob Reilly","Yeah.","Ken Usdin","\u2026 you laid up a lot of individual pieces, but I just wanted to make sure that...","Rob Reilly","Yeah. That\u2019s right.","Ken Usdin","... I understand it?","Rob Reilly","No, no, no. Yeah, yeah. No, that\u2019s right, Ken. So, the 350 captures everything that we planned to do in 2017. Bill mentioned, there could be upside, it\u2019s in the back half of the year. I think it\u2019s an important point though on the consumer lending transformation that we talked about, which is really a multi-year process. So, most of the savings that we talked about and pointed out there kick in post 2017 but we\u2019re working on it now.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Great. Thank you for that.","Rob Reilly","Yeah.","Ken Usdin","And then just on the fee side, if you\u2019re in that mid single-digit zone, in your kind of outlook for fees. I\u2019m wondering just what, if you could parse out, what do you think is going to lead that this year, your last year was a bit of a mixed year with asset management having the charge....","Rob Reilly","Yeah, yeah, yeah.","Ken Usdin","....and then the resi mortgage, so what do you think steps back up this year?","Rob Reilly","Well, I think, it\u2019s largely -- it\u2019s largely the same trends. If you just go through the opponents, I would still say asset management in the mid to high-single digits, consumer services mid to high-single digits, corporate service mid-single digits and residential mortgage probably lower than that. And that\u2019s how I -- don\u2019t add all that up, so that doesn\u2019t add up, but that\u2019s generally the trend that we\u2019ve been on and that\u2019s why that I point to mid-single digits.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And just one quick one, did you -- can you quantify just how much forward purchases of the securities you did that will settle in 1Q?","Bill Demchak","I don\u2019t know the answer, Rob, certainly\u2026","Rob Reilly","I think its $3\u2026","Bill Demchak","$3, yeah\u2026","Rob Reilly","Yeah, $3 -- just over $3 billion.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Bill Demchak","Yeah. Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.","Matt Burnell","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe a question -- a couple of related questions for you, Rob. First of all and I apologize if I missed any comment you may have said this -- said about this early on. But any change to your thinking about managing the AOCI risk as rates rise, now that it at least appears at this point that we could get a little bit greater of a rate increase than we\u2019ve seen in the past few years?","And then just on a related question in terms of any change in your thinking about deposit beta? I noticed in the fourth quarter, there was a little in -- there was a 1 basis point increase in your overall deposit costs\u2026","Rob Reilly","Yeah.","Matt Burnell","\u2026 which was actually last fourth quarter, when we have the 25 basis points hike, there was a 1 basis point decline.","Rob Reilly","Right.","Matt Burnell","So I just curious if there is any changes you\u2019re thinking about deposit beta?","Bill Demchak","You answer.","Rob Reilly","Okay. So what I\u2019ll do is the deposit beta one first. And I\u2019m not sure, I understand the AOCI question\u2026","Bill Demchak","Actually.","Rob Reilly","\u2026 but on the deposit data, obviously, we keep a close eye on it. We\u2019ve -- we break it down between the commercial and the consumer. On the consumer side, we\u2019ve made some moves in 2016. We backed off promos a little bit. So I don\u2019t expect a beta move on the consumer side soon.","Commercials are a little bit more fluid. You can see, we\u2019re still trending below what the average is, so we may see some movement in \u201817 on the commercial. But I would definitely expect to see sequence-wise commercial before consumer not sure.","Bill Demchak","Yeah. Commercial has been running maybe 45% and part of that is driven by the dynamics inside the changing rules and the money for the industry where...","Rob Reilly","Right.","Matt Burnell","Sure.","Bill Demchak","The yields we\u2019re offering are still attractive relative to a treasury-only fund. On the consumer side, there is some noise in there, because what happened was, as we get ready for LCR in \u201816, we had sort of promo rates, which were a large portion of our production, and obviously, higher than straight head-funds rates.","Matt Burnell","Okay.","Bill Demchak","And we basically have weaned ourselves off of that today and we go with our base savings account.","Matt Burnell","Okay.","Bill Demchak","So, what you saw in terms of that basis point drop was getting out of promo and into something else and then...","Rob Reilly","That\u2019s right.","Bill Demchak","... it\u2019s probably random noise\u2026","Matt Burnell","Okay.","Bill Demchak","\u2026 that you see a basis point increase because we haven\u2019t changed and effectively haven\u2019t passed through on the consumer side\u2026","Rob Reilly","Which is why it\u2019s\u2026","Bill Demchak","\u2026 which is why it\u2019s changing rates, yeah.","Rob Reilly","Yeah.","Bill Demchak","On the AOCI it\u2019s just real quickly, we\u2019ve used...","Matt Burnell","Yeah.","Bill Demchak","...and you\u2019ll see it, our held-to-maturity account appropriately, this quarter I think total AOCI as a function that hit the capitals, maybe a quarter of a point, we stress it inside of our own internally run stress, as we don\u2019t think that\u2019s a constraint on us as we go forward. I would tell you that, the move that we\u2019ve had -- think about the move we\u2019ve had in the back just a 10-year part of the curve through the fourth quarter is largely 80 basis points, which effectively is extended any mortgages or mortgage-backed securities you had in that book as far as you\u2019re going to go.","So, the negative convexity in terms of the size of the move of the markets you are going to have, my guess for us and everybody else is probably highest this quarter than what you\u2019re going to see going forward.","Rob Reilly","Yeah. And I would just add to that, that\u2019s right 20 basis points, so capital ratio went from 10.2 to 10\u2026","Bill Demchak","Yeah.","Rob Reilly","\u2026 on that hit.","Matt Burnell","Okay. Guys, thanks for the color. I appreciate it.","Rob Reilly","Yeah. Sure.","Bill Demchak","Thank you, Matt.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Please proceed.","Bill Demchak","Terry, are you there.","Operator","I do believe the line has disconnected. We shall proceed with the next question. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rose with Raymond James. Please proceed.","Michael Rose","Hey, everyone. Most of my questions have been answered. Just wanted to ask a question on energy. It look like the oil and gas loans were up a little bit. I just want to get sense for, is that draws on existing lines or you actually starting to see opportunities to grow that portfolio, I know it\u2019s small. And then as a follow-up, you kind of sided throughout the year that oil and gas was driver of the provision, how much was the contribution to energy this year from provision and how is that relates to your outlook for 2017? Thanks.","Bill Demchak","Okay. Well, I can take that down a little bit there. The energy loans did actually rise a little bit. We\u2019re still in terms of outstandings in that, $2.5 -- $2.4 billion, $2.5 billion range. And to answer your question, it was more -- the growth was more just good solid deal, so not anything in terms of draw. I don\u2019t have handy the exact breakout. We did that in the slides last quarter for you in terms of the total provision that was energy related.","Rob Reilly","But part of the issue, but you think that\u2026","Bill Demchak","Right.","Rob Reilly","\u2026 on provision this year and even some of our charge-offs, a lot of it was not direct energy but rather industry is impacted by...","Bill Demchak","That\u2019s right. Yeah. That\u2019s right. Yeah.","Rob Reilly","So some of the charge-offs we\u2019ve had in our asset base book and our services book were not directly energy, but basically companies have lost demand because of it. The issue we have is, we get forward provision guidance and we\u2019re going to say this every time, somebody asks us is, provisions have been low, particularly when you back up the spike that we saw in energy or energy-related early in the year and at some point, they\u2019re going to normalize, whether we run a 20 basis points of charge-offs this quarter, it ought to be through the cycle 50 and so, we kind of always tell you, watch for the 50, even though I don\u2019t necessarily expect it next quarter and you\u2019ll ask me again next quarter and we\u2019ll see what we think about the second...","Bill Demchak","That\u2019s been the issue for the last couple of years, but bulk of the increase in the provision was energy related. We can get to that I think...","Rob Reilly","Yeah. I\u2019ll get to that Michael.","Bill Demchak","Yeah.","Michael Rose","Okay. Thanks a lot. I appreciate the color.","Bill Demchak","Sure. Next question please, okay.","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. We do have Terry McEvoy connected from Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Terry McEvoy","Hi. Thank you. Sorry about that. I guess the question for Bill. At this point in the credit cycle, PNC\u2019s loan growth would lag the industry and if you talk about that for a while now, but if we think about accelerating economic growth, are you willing to take more credit risk to show loan growth, so is this a different playbook given the backdrop that\u2019s emerged since the elections?","Bill Demchak","Well, I think, it\u2019s a different opportunity book. So, our loan growth if you think, if you track all the categories through time, we had reasonable growth in asset-based lending, equipment finance, a large growth in real estate. We\u2019ve seen, particularly in real estate that trend continued to drop as we\u2019ve seen the heat that\u2019s kind of hit multi-family and some other things, other people continue to accelerate and continue to grow that book at high rates, we\u2019ve basically backed off that, I don\u2019t know that that changes.","What the bullishness in the economy, infrastructure spend if corporates get back to capital, what that causes is growth in middle market and continued activity. We\u2019ve also had growth in large corporate, mostly on the back of M&A related activity. But those two things probably accelerate if the buzz in the air becomes real, right. If people -- if we really do get infrastructure spend at the state and local level, if we really do get companies feeling confident about their ability to invest in core durables in a profitable way. We don\u2019t have that in any of our guidance. But the bullish side, I mean, suggest that that opportunity sits out there.","Terry McEvoy","Great. And then just a follow-up question for Rob. The seasonal increase in commercial deposits in the fourth quarter, has that left the balance sheet by the end of the year or do you expect\u2026","Rob Reilly","Yeah.","Terry McEvoy","\u2026some seasonality to decline in the first quarter?","Rob Reilly","Yeah. No it did. So, you can see on the spot commercial deposits were down.","Terry McEvoy","Perfect. Thanks so much.","Rob Reilly","Yeah.","Bill Demchak","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Kevin Barker","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to follow-up on the question that was just asked about loan growth and you\u2019re saying that C&I loan growth is going to accelerate given the backdrop that we\u2019re seeing right now, but at the same time we have corporate leverage which is very high compared to what we saw...","Rob Reilly","Yeah.","Kevin Barker","...post crisis and we have interest rates moving higher. How do you think about the balance between corporate leverage being high and rates moving higher, while also seeing growth in company\u2019s spending?","Rob Reilly","So, you\u2019ve got to remember, who our core clients are which bulk investment grade corporate leverage, I think, is it an all time high and will on a coverage ratio basis get worse as rates rises, something they\u2019re not 100% hedged, which I think is a safe assumption.","They still have debt capacity. So, the way we kind of think about it is, it wouldn\u2019t be unlikely that you would see at least in our internal ratings downgrades in provision, but it wouldn\u2019t stop us from lending into an economically profitable relationship, albeit at a higher spread and hopefully more cross-sell associated with it.","So, there is loan demand out there coming from the BB+, BBB kind of sweet spot client for us, we\u2019ll lend into that. But the issue in middle market for the last two years or three years, as they just haven\u2019t borrowed. The borrowings you\u2019ve seen have been largely large corporate and that\u2019s been M&A related and\/or share price, share repurchase which is driven leverage. I think there is a big opportunity for this country for kind of middle to small large size corporate to start investing in themselves and to grow.","And like I said, we saw -- we had a record sales month in the corporate bank in December and we saw growth in middle market balances for the first time in a lot of quarters in the fourth quarter. We had a record quarter, on our Southeast markets particularly in Chicago. So there is a lot of good momentum out there.","What I\u2019m cautious about is nothing has actually happened yet, other than there has been a move in rates, right, and it changes sentiment. And I think we need to start seeing some of confirmations get through. We need to see real progress on tax reform. We need to see real progress on infrastructure, spending bills of state and local, and then all of a sudden, this thing takes flight, but right now, it\u2019s just people talking about it.","Kevin Barker","Okay. And then on to another topic, I noticed that you marked up your MSR by about 43% this quarter. It appears that the gain was entirely offset by hedging. Could you help us understand how that changed this quarter and how it flowed to the income statement?","Bill Demchak","Well, I mean, that the markup, I\u2019ll accept your percentage, I haven\u2019t looked at it. But just the rise in rates, the MSR is a big IO strip. So the value of that goes up.","Kevin Barker","Okay.","Bill Demchak","We hedge it as effectively as we can. Our hedges outperformed the valuation move and the MSR. So we had a net gain in MSR hedging. I don\u2019t know, Rob, what the net was this quarter, $30 million.","Rob Reilly","$30 million on residential and $20 million on commercial, yes.","Bill Demchak","Yeah.","Kevin Barker","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Bill Demchak","But there is no -- there is nothing inherently magical about this quarter other than the rate move itself. Again, if you go from Sep 30 to December 30 and you\u2019ve got 80 basis points plus in the tenure, that causes a big swing in the value of that asset.","Kevin Barker","All right. Was there a change in accounting regarding the MSR, was that just a drop, I\u2019m not sure...","Bill Demchak","No. It\u2019s effectively at a mark-to-market asset as a function of rates in prepay and all bunch of other assumptions, but none of that -- what changed was the inputs, not anything with the model or the accounting, that\u2019s it.","Kevin Barker","Okay. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please proceed.","Brian Klock","Thank you and good morning. Bill, I had a follow-up question again, I guess, on the commercial loan side. You talked about how strong December was, I wanted to, I guess, follow-up and think about. If we\u2019re looking at the linked-quarter, it does look like loan growth was down a little bit from the linked-quarter and actually it was little softer in the retail, wholesale and manufacturing side of things. Overall, on a year-over-year basis, it\u2019s only up 2.8%. So, I guess, are you seeing more extensions of lines of credit, maybe the utilization rates have gone down and is there any...","Bill Demchak","Utilization hasn\u2019t changed, I\u2019m not sure, I mean, if I think of our mix and I\u2019m not exactly sure what table you\u2019re looking at. But if I think of our mix, we\u2019ve seen real estate slowdown. We\u2019ve seen large corporate continue at a decent pace. We saw middle markets finally turn positive. We\u2019ve seen continued slow runoff in our smaller commercial book largely related to just running off old acquired books as opposed to new activity. We\u2019ve seen growth in utilities as we\u2019ve sort of begun kind of an aggressive cross-sell campaign against that book of business. We\u2019ve seen stabilization finally in our asset base finance business. We did a lot of work there around LCR a year ago and we saw big quarter in equipment finance, largely just on the back of good cross-sell of that product into our traditional corporate clients.","So, I don\u2019t -- I -- the momentum feels right, probably, the one thing that has changed, through the course of 2016 is slowed down in the balances of our asset base lending book. As refis continue to kind of head towards cash flow lending on some of that and some of the utilization on that book, particularly related to energy-related credits is in fact declined. But core middle market that -- to me the broader economy, what\u2019s driving our GDP, I get excited about when I see sort of core middle market businesses, manufacturers start to borrow and they did that in the fourth quarter.","Rob Reilly","And that\u2019s our biggest customers there.","Bill Demchak","Yeah.","Brian Klock","Got you. And I guess, thinking about that way, your commercial loan growth, you continue to have the sort of runoff in the non-strategic and some of those consumer books, which weigh down the overall consumer.","Bill Demchak","Yeah.","Brian Klock","So you think the 5%, I guess, would it be a 5% plus growth you would get from commercial or maybe the consumer would be a positive this quarter or maybe just less of a negative\u2026","Bill Demchak","Well, consumer was\u2026","Brian Klock","\u2026 that can shift to overall mid-single.","Bill Demchak","Well, consumer was positive this quarter. We have planned it to be so into \u201917, and I guess if you trend line what we had in C&I and now that might be a mix shift...","Rob Reilly","Mix shift. That\u2019s right\u2026","Bill Demchak","\u2026 it will be little bit higher, yeah.","Rob Reilly","But if -- the point is will we see some more momentum around consumer, the answer is, yes. We are expecting that.","Bill Demchak","Yeah.","Brian Klock","All right. Thanks for your time.","Bill Demchak","Yeah.","Rob Reilly","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions.","Bill Demchak","Thank you very much for joining the call and we look forward to working with you.","Rob Reilly","Thanks, everybody.","Bryan Gill","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Callihan","Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call is PNC's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Demchak and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Our forward-looking statements regarding PNC's performance assume a continuation of the current economic trends and do not take into account the impact of potential legal and regulatory contingencies. Actual results and future events could differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in our statements and from historical performance due to a variety of risks and other factors.","Information about such factors, as well as GAAP reconciliations and other information on non-GAAP financial measures we discuss is included in today's conference call, earnings release, and related presentation materials and in our 10-K, 10-Q and various other SEC filings and investor materials.","These are all available on the corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of October 15, 2014, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bill Demchak.","William S. Demchak","Thanks Bill and good morning everybody. As you have seen this morning we reported net income of $1 billion, $1.79 per diluted common share for the quarter with a return on average assets of 1.25%. These results are very much in keeping with our expectations and our guidance. And you saw that we grew revenue in the quarter on the back of 4% increase in fee income which overcame a slight decline in net interest income. Loans were up slightly on an average basis but they are actually down quarter-to-quarter on a spot basis. We continue to win new customers across our lines of business in the quarter and increasingly we are focusing on deepening relationships with existing customers through cross sell. ","Additionally we continue to manage expenses well and completed the actions to achieve our 2014 continuous improvement target ahead of schedule. Credit quality continues to improve and we improved our capital position. So as I said a couple of months ago, I am pleased with how we are executing against our strategic priorities and controlling the things that we can control and what is proving to be a challenging revenue environment. Our third quarter results, another quarter with a billion dollars or more of net income speak to the consistency of our approach. ","Now having said that, I spent quite a bit of time with a lot of you over the last couple of months and I know that many of you are turning your attention to 2015. And while we\u2019re in the early days of our budgeting process and I am not going to give you specific guidance here, but just looking at the economic and industry trends, there are a few comments I\u2019ll make about our outlook for the remainder of this year and for 2015 before I turn it over to Rob. ","You know when we look into next year we believe that we are going to be able to continue to execute against our plans to grow free income and control expenses. While it is likely that our credit provision will rise from the historically low levels of this year, we believe credit charges will be well contained also. You know the wild card is obviously net interest income. The issue is if, when, and how much the Fed will raise rates next year and I\u2019ll tell you we currently forecast and are planning against a midyear rate cut, rate hike with funds getting to 1% by the end of the year. ","Now this is somewhat less aggressive then the Feds own rate plots but particularly after this morning it\u2019s much more aggressive than what\u2019s currently priced in the market. I think at one point this morning futures actually had the Fed completely out of the market next year and we come back from that but we are obviously in a pretty volatile period of time for rates. And rates are going to be the thing that largely drives our net interest income performance next year.","Now as in the past we\u2019ll look to give you more specific guidance at yearend but our early look ahead anticipates the revenue environment is going to remain difficult for the industry until rates rise, and that our opportunity lie in our ability to execute against our long term strategic priorities. Now with that I will turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our third quarter results and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Rob?","Robert Q. Reilly","Thanks Bill and good morning everyone. Overall our third quarter results were largely in line with our expectations and demonstrate our ability to execute on our strategic growth priorities. As you know, the sustained low interest rate environment continues to affect our net interest income as it has for some time and for the reasons that Bill just mentioned. However we saw solid fee income growth this quarter that exceeded our expectations and more than offset the decline in net interest income resulting in revenue growth on a linked quarter basis. Expenses remain well controlled and credit quality was favorable. Our B3 common capital ratios improved even after $670 million in share buybacks and dividends in the third quarter. ","Turning to our average balance sheet on slide 4, total assets increased by $7 billion or 2% on a linked quarter basis. This increase was driven by higher deposits held with the Federal Reserve and to a lesser extent higher average loan balances. Average commercial loans during the third quarter were up $913 million or 1% from the second quarter. And average consumer lending was down by $318 million linked quarter as lower home equity, residential mortgage, and education loans more than offset increases on automobile lending. ","Our third quarter spot loan balances were essentially flat reflecting a higher level of loan activity late in the second quarter. As well as overall slowing loan condition -- slowing loan growth conditions in the third quarter. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, average loans increased by $9 billion or 5%. Importantly we achieve this growth despite $1.5 billion in run off of loans from our non-strategic assets portfolio during the same period. ","Average investment securities decreased $1.9 billion or 3% in the third quarter as net payments and maturities exceeded our reinvestment activity. For the reasons Bill outlined this is consistent with our view of the low opportunity cost of holding relatively lower balances in the current interest rate environment. And lastly our average interest earning deposits with banks primarily with the Federal Reserve were $22 billion as of September 30th, in large part due to satisfying the requirements of the liquidity coverage rules. I\u2019ll have more to say on that in a moment. ","On the liability side total average deposits increased by $3.9 billion or 2% when compared to June 30th, driven mostly by increases on the commercial side. Compared to the same quarter a year ago total average deposits increased by $12 billion or 6%. In both periods we saw growth in demand and money market transaction deposits partially offset by lower retail CDs.","On an average basis, total equity increased by $546 million or 1% in the third quarter primarily due to growth in retained earnings. This helped drive our capital ratios higher. Our pro forma Basel III common equity Tier I ratio fully phased in and using the standardized approach was estimated to be 10.1% as of September 30th, a 10 basis points increase from the end of the second quarter. As I mentioned our balance sheet reflects our efforts to comply with the liquidity coverage standards and support loan growth. For example our average interest earning deposits with banks in the third quarter which are primarily with the Federal Reserve, increased by $7.5 billion or 51% and by $17.5 billion or more than 375% compared to the same time a year ago. ","Further on the liability side we increased average total borrowings by $2.2 billion or 5% linked quarter. As you know on September 3rd the Federal Reserve issued the final rules on the liquidity coverage ratio and PNC is subject to the full LCR approach. Based on preliminary estimates we expect to be well above the 80% requirement using the month-end reporting methodology when it goes into effect on January 1, 2015. ","Under our existing common stock repurchase authorization we purchased 4.2 million common shares for approximately $360 million during the third quarter. Since the beginning of our current program which as you know began in the second quarter of 2014, we have repurchased 6.8 million common shares representing approximately 40% of our approved total capital plan, an amount of 1.5 billion. Finally our tangible book value reached $59.24 per common share at September 30th, a 2% increase linked quarter and a 14% increase compared to the same time a year ago. ","Turning to our income statement on slide 5, net income was $1 billion or $1.79 per diluted common share and our return on average assets was 1.25%. Our third quarter performance for net interest income and expenses was largely as we expected while we exceeded expectations on fee income and provision. As a result of our strong fee performance total revenue increased by $31 million or 1% linked quarter. ","Let me highlight a few items in our income statement. Net interest income declined by $25 million or 1% compared to the second quarter primarily attributable to lower earning asset yields and investment security balances as well as the impacts of our higher liquidity position. Purchase accounting accretion was essentially flat in the third quarter which was better than we expected due to higher than anticipated cash recoveries. ","Non-interest income increased by $56 million or 3% linked quarter. This performance is better than expected due to growth in asset management, corporate services, and service charges on deposits. Non-interest expense increased by $29 million or 1% in the third quarter at the lower end of our guidance as expenses continued to be well managed. Importantly during the third quarter we exceeded the full year target of our continuous improvement program, more on that later. Finally provision in the third quarter declined to $55 million due to continued overall positive credit trends. ","Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to net interest income on slide 6, total net interest income decreased by $25 million or 1% for the reasons I just highlighted. As I mentioned, purchase accounting accretion of $147 million was flat on a linked quarter basis as cash recoveries were better than expected. Core net interest income declined by $25 million due to lower earning asset yields and security balances. ","Regarding purchase accounting we were forecasting it to be down $300 million for the full year 2014 compared to 2013. With the higher than anticipated cash recoveries we experienced in the third quarter we now expect it will be down for the full year approximately $275 million. And while we are on the subject, for 2015 we continue to expect purchase accounting accretion to be down approximately $225 million for the full year compared to 2014. ","Net interest margin declined 14 basis points linked quarter. Of that amount approximately 8 basis points was the result of our increased balances with the Federal Reserve resulting from an increase in customer deposits and lower security balances. Approximately 4 basis points of the decline was due to spread compression and the remaining 2 basis points was due to specific LCR related actions. ","In terms of our interest rate sensitivity, our balance sheet remains asset sensitive. We recognize this will likely constrain our NII growth in the short-term and as mentioned earlier we believe the opportunity cost of this position in the current interest rate environment is low. ","Turning to non-interest income on slide 7, we saw strong fee income growth this quarter reflecting progress we continue to make against our strategic priorities. Total non-interest income increased by $56 million or 3% linked quarter primarily driven by solid performance in our diversified businesses. Asset management fees increased $49 million or 14% on a linked quarter basis. As you know the asset management fee category reflects the combination of fees generated by our asset management business along with the earnings attributable to our interest in BlackRock. While our asset management business performed well in the third quarter, the linked quarter fee increases related to the strong performance from Blackrock. ","Compared to the same quarter of last year overall asset management fees were up $81 million or 25% due to increases in equity markets and sales production. Consumer services fees were relatively flat in third quarter, down $3 million or 1% as customer activity equaled second quarter levels. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, consumer service fees were up $4 million or 1% primarily due to higher credit and debit card activity. Corporate service fees were up $31 million or 9% linked quarter primarily due to higher merger and acquisition advisory fees and corporate finance fees for loans indications. And year-over-year growth excluding the impact of a fee reclassification in the second quarter of 2014, corporate service fees increased by $36 million or 12%.","Harris Williams, our M&A advisory services firm is on pace to have a record year. Residential mortgage banking noninterest income declined by $42 million linked quarter primarily due to lower loan sales revenues. As you will recall these were elevated in the second quarter to $61 million related to portfolio loans. Origination volume was $2.6 billion up $52 million or 2% from second quarter levels. However originations were down from $3.7 billion in the same quarter a year ago. ","Purchase originations production of 1.3 billion in the third quarter represented 50% of our total originations reflecting our strategic focus in this area. The gain on sale margin was 380 basis points in the third quarter primarily due to favorable mark to market adjustments on our loan. We continue to expect our margin to trend closer to 300 basis points in the fourth quarter and in 2015. ","Service charges on deposits increased by $23 million or 15% in both the linked quarter and prior year quarter. Both periods benefitted primarily from changes in product offerings along with higher customer related activity. Other categories of noninterest income and the aggregate were essentially flat linked quarter. Of note we did have a pretax gain of $57 million on the sale of 1 million Visa Class B common shares that compared with a $54 million gain on Visa shares that took place in the second quarter.","Noninterest income to total revenue was 45% in the third quarter, up one percentage points from the second quarter levels and up two points from the same quarter a year ago. While acknowledging this ratio improves by the decline we are seeing in NII, it nonetheless reflects our substantially diversified business mix and the strategic progress we are making to increase overall fee income on both an absolute and relative basis.","Turning to expenses on slide 8, third quarter levels increased by $29 million or 1%, the increase was due to higher personnel cost as a result of increased variable compensation cost from business activity as well as equipment cost primarily related to technology and business investments. Year-to-date expenses declined by $218 million or 3%. This improvement reflects the benefits from our continuous improvement program and overall expense management. In fact through nine months we have completed actions to achieve our full 2014 goal of the $500 million in cost savings. As you know these savings are funding the significant investments we are making in our infrastructure and in our retail transformation. ","As you can see on slide 9 overall credit quality continued to improve in the third quarter. Nonperforming loans were down $189 million or 7% compared to the second quarter as we continue to see broad improvements across our commercial and consumer portfolios. Total past due loans decreased by $92 million or 4% linked quarter, with the greatest declines in the over 90 day category. ","Net charge off at $82 million declined by $63 million or 43% linked quarter and with 16 basis points of average loans on an annualized basis down 13 basis points linked quarter. Our provision of $55 million declined by $17 million or 24% on a linked quarter basis. And finally the allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans is 1.7% as of September 30th. While we were pleased with this performance and as we have acknowledged for some time, we continue to believe credit trends may not remain at these levels. ","In summary PNC posted a successful third quarter largely consistent with our expectations. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter we expect many of the trends we saw in the third quarter to continue through year end. We expect modest growth in loans primarily in our commercial portfolio. We expect net interest income to be down modestly due to this continued decline in purchase accounting accretion and further spread compression. We expect fee income to remain stable as we anticipate seasonal growth and higher business activity in the fourth quarter to effectively equal the elevated M&A advisory fees we generated in the third quarter. ","We expect noninterest expense to be up by low single digits on a percentage basis as we typically incur seasonally higher expenses in the fourth quarter and as we continue to invest in our business and infrastructure. Importantly we expect to partially offset this increase with expected cost savings from our continuous improvement program. And assuming a continuation of current credit trends, we expect the provision for credit losses to be between $25 million and $75 million. And with that Bill and I are ready to take your questions. ","William H. Callihan","Operator if you could give our participants the instructions please. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Certainly, thank you. (Operator Instructions). Please hold while we compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with the Bank of America. Please go ahead. ","William S. Demchak","Hi, Erika.","Robert Q. Reilly","Good morning.","William S. Demchak","Good morning. Hello.","Operator","Your line is open. ","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Yes, hi, can you hear me. ","William S. Demchak","Yes. ","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Hello, great. You know Bill, you said at the top of the call that you are in the middle of budgeting for 2015 and clearly the results this year have shown that you are executing on the things that you can control specifically on the year-over-year progress and expenses. As we look forward to 2015, let's just say that the market was at this point right this morning and let's take the prospect of rising short rates out of the way, could we expect the efficiency ratio to improve from the 61% that you have been posting next year?","William S. Demchak","I don\u2019t see how. I think we are going to be able to -- we will control expenses but at the end of the day and you have heard me say this before, real improvement in the efficiency ratio got to come from the revenue side and we are driving that on fee income, but it's got to come out of NII and we are so underleveraged as a firm right now that the opportunity for us if and when rates rise is what is going to drive a material change in that ratio. So we are going to focus on expenses and doing good job on it but moving wherever you want even if we manage to drop them a couple of hundred million and I am not saying we are going to, it doesn\u2019t really move the needle here. ","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Okay, got it. And just as my follow-up question, Rob given your comments on the LCR, it sounds like most of the LCR driven liquidity action should be fully in the run rate at this point, so there shouldn\u2019t be further incremental hits from LCR related balance sheet optimization at this point?","Robert Q. Reilly","Yeah, good morning. I would say the bulk of the work is behind us. There may be some incremental work on the margin but the vast majority is behind us. ","William S. Demchak","The other thing, I will just add to that, I mean when you look at the drop in the NIM in the quarter just because it sort of spike in largely corporate deposits, you know, it is neutral to income, it is not necessarily LCR related, it just kind of flows that are coming in the form of deposit and largely being held at the Fed at this point. So it is affecting them but it is not costing us anything. ","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Got it. Thank you so much.","William H. Callihan","Next question please. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Hi, how are you?","William S. Demchak","Good morning, good. ","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Hey, couple of questions. One was just on the LCR because you did get that final rule set recently and I wanted to understand how it impacts you because I know it was a wide range going into that final rule?","Robert Q. Reilly","Sure, this is Rob. But generally speaking the final rules were announced, PNC was viewed and is categorized as being under the full approach. There was an open issue whether that was going to happen or not but we are in the full approach. Largely in terms of the final rules compared to a conservative rate of the proposed rules it was a net better move for us in terms of how far we had to go. But you can tell by the Fed balances that we have built through the year, we have moved considerably in terms of our liquidity position and very comfortable that we can meet the levels as they are phased in. ","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Right, it was better because more operational deposits then what you could have potentially had?","William S. Demchak","It was a whole bunch of little singles from the way you would look through to you know securitization. Of course for receivables it was operating deposits, it was some impact on municipals and VRDN (ph). So bunch of little stuff at the margin where in our previous planning we\u2019d kind of assume when we just you know as is our nature we assume the worse.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Got it, okay and then two questions; one, on you said possibly let's take the other side of the question that Erika had let\u2019s say the global growth is not as bad as people think and rates start to go back up. You know the Fed put out this comment back in September saying that the RP would be capped at 300 billion, so do you end up raising rates through increasing IOER or does your interest rate sensitivity stay the same because the question is does IOER going up impact your asset yields since most of that\u2019s based off of Fed fund part of the curve?","William S. Demchak","Sorry IOER meaning the excess reserve balances.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Right.","William S. Demchak","If they raise short rates through whatever mechanism either you know rates on excess balances or the reverse speed ball facility for money funds on the four side of the equation, we make money. We make money if short rates go up and that will be their impact. Now if they do that, we\u2019ll see what the impact is on longer rates. Our base assumption, you heard me talk about it in planning isn\u2019t really heroic. We are kind of saying that they move in Julyish and they go -- they get funds or short rates to 1 % by the end of the year. If they go more than that, we obviously have more leverage you know and greater upside than what we are currently planning as we think about the future. I don\u2019t, you know, just as in a side, the economy right now we go and talk to our clients but actually feels a lot better than the sentiment. So I am personally a bit confused after we get the news out of Europe which is clearly struggling. The U.S. economy feels very strong and resilient. And personally I think this is a bit of an overreaction, particularly on the rate side. We\u2019ve had an equity correction here that\u2019s down and I don\u2019t know what it is right now 7% or 8% from the highs. But we rallied rates down to basically zero again and I am taking the Fed off the table for all of 15, at least as the market saying. That doesn\u2019t feel right to me.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay and the technical part of the question I was asking was that if you are not able to lift Vibor (ph) or prime because Fed fund isn\u2019t moving, then I get the point that you totally get a better -- you\u2019re asset sensitive with excess reserves and so your earnings go up but if your loan balances are not able to react if Fed Funds stays where it is then do you pass anything on to the depositors or does it make you less asset sensitive then usually?","William S. Demchak","I haven\u2019t focused on that. I see where you are going. If the Fed is unable to make that connection in short rates. Look at the end of the day if somehow they manage to increase excess reserve rates and Vibor doesn\u2019t move which I don\u2019t think is a likely outcome. Then the other rates we are going to be paying on deposits would suffer. ","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay and then just on loan growth because I know it was little bit lighter Q-on-Q but second quarter was very strong, I just want to understand what you are thinking will be driving that, you know C&I over the next couple of quarters?","William S. Demchak","I think the third quarter was perhaps a bit anomalous. You know we ended up kind of flat a little bit up in C&I, some gives and takes in different books. The general theme continues to be growth on our specialty businesses, asset based real estate, lease finance. We\u2019ve seen growth in large corporate as we seen the M&A activity continue to set records and a lot of borrowing to do, dividends and share repurchase. So I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s necessarily going to change. I think in Robs comments he kind of suggested.","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes I said, we did see a spike up there at the end of the second quarter, which was higher jumping off point and there was growth conditions in the third quarter albeit slowing growth. So that combination put us in a\u2026","William S. Demchak","We are saying low single digit growth."," ","Robert Q. Reilly","But our guidance for the fourth quarter calls for continuation of modest loan growth, principally on commercial side. ","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Great and driven by more planned equipment investing?","William S. Demchak","No haven\u2019t -- it really hasn\u2019t taken off. We are seeing loans, I wish there was a way to pass through it, but my best guess is the bulk of the balance growth we see beyond real estate, in a project based real estate in the C&I space is largely due to kind of M&A and leverage, share buyback, excess dividend, and so forth. You still see the planned equipment investment, it is still well below where it ought to be running given where the economy is so that's kind of an upside if and when it happens. ","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Alright, hey thanks a lot. ","William S. Demchak","Yeah sure. ","William H. Callihan","Next question please. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Hey guys. ","William S. Demchak","Good morning Matt. ","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Seeing some good momentum in the capital markets advisory areas and I think you announced an acquisition there recently, so maybe if you can talk a little bit about both the current trends that you are seeing and then just kind of longer-term strategy and how meaningful this could be to PNC overall?","William S. Demchak","Yes, so Harris Williams is on pace in fact they might have already had their record year after three quarters. You know they had their gaining share in what is a very hot M&A market. We have owned them now for 10 years plus or minus and beyond what they contribute to the bottom line for us they basically help our dialogue with our corporate customers. It is kind of another arrow on the quiver when we go out and want to have a meaningful relationship with the middle market company having the leading advisory firm helps. ","Solebury, who we announced in the quarter we purchased as an advisory firm that basically helps people through the IPO process. They don\u2019t take a principal position and they don\u2019t take a management position in effect in the IPO but rather they advice people on who to choose and how to go about it. And they help people with investor relations. We did that as a sort of a complimentary product to the Harris Williams product in the sense that when Harris Williams goes and pitches for a sale out of a private equity shop more often than not they are not only pitching against another advisory they are pitching against an IPO. And we want it as a firm to have a full service solution set to those clients and that's what Solebury does. ","Bottom line, both of them add to our bottom line but as much as anything else they add to our broader relationship with middle market companies which is the key point we are trying to drive. ","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay, so don\u2019t just focus on the fee revenues it kicks off but is kind of broader relationship that has been\u2026?","William S. Demchak","In its simplest form if you think of a private middle market company and you say would you like to take a meeting with the leading firm who has done a bunch of deals in your industry, both on the advisory and the IPO side, you get a meeting with the CEO, they want to hear about it. They all want to hear what their company is worth and what their competitors are doing and what the future holds for them. Yes, it is a great calling card. ","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay, and then just separately within the credit, obviously very strongest quarter, I noticed you had higher recoveries both in commercial and residential and I am just wondering if we get into the point of residential where it might be kind of higher or longer on the recovery side?","Robert Q. Reilly","Well you know we have been saying that for some time Matt that these levels we do believe are unsustainably lower over a long period of time. But each quarter, the things seem to stay pretty good. ","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Actually sorry, I meant on the recovery side against the charge offs, you had a pickup in both commercial and residential real estate and I didn\u2019t know if there was just kind of a reevaluation or something?","Robert Q. Reilly","Nothing specially, it is just we are working off of a relatively low level there so it is nothing particularly departing from the current themes. ","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay, and actually then lastly if I can sneak in on the interest rates here, I think you and some other banks talked about not reinvesting sort of the proceeds as much in the third quarter and I think that's one of the reasons why rates are coming down so much that lot of folks were trying to stay shorter on the duration and now you are having to squeeze, I guess it was just like what do you do now, why you kind of waited out to kind of the securities folks shrink a little bit more?","William S. Demchak","Couple of things, we are actually notwithstanding the drop in securities balances spot and average, second or third quarter. We are actually through TBAs and forward starting slots and some other banks probably held that position largely flat. So, we didn\u2019t get shorter on a duration basis per say through the third quarter. Given where rates have gone here, so you are going to now have a period of time where you are going to see prepayments on anything that can prepay and we think if we didn\u2019t like them before we really don\u2019t like them now so if anything else we might look at opportunity to monetize here. But we are certainly not going to invest into it more heavily at this level. The opportunity cost is just sitting on the sidelines is low enough that you stay on the sidelines. ","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay yes, I would agree. Thank you.","William H. Callihan","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital, please go ahead.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital","Thank you very much. My question goes back to and I think you made a comment and I am not sure if I heard it correctly, it goes back to the core NII and the total NII. You talk about higher liquidity positions is driving that lower and lower asset yields but did you mention some of the reinvestment opportunities, in other words are you making a decision to pull back a little bit until you get, so you can redeploy with better yields maybe down the road since you do think the Fed at some point is going to raise rates?","William S. Demchak","No, looking at simplest form you are connecting a lot of dots here but in the simplest form we are under invested fixed rates and have been for a long period of time to take advantage when rates go up. You can see that visibly in the balance sheet somewhat by the securities balances declining but also just through the balances that are growing at the Federal Reserve which are obviously floating rate balances. Right, in its simplest form if we wanted to you could take the Fed balances and the LCR neutral by investing them in treasuries. If you look the yield on the two year treasury right now, that in 29 basis points which is 4 basis points more than I get leaving a floating at the Feds. So I\u2019ll leave them there. But we do have a lot of dry powder, we\u2019ve been that way for a while. We\u2019ve been wrong for a while right, I wish I had a perfect crystal ball and we could have invested and then sell everything today but we didn\u2019t. And we are not in the business of kind of making those dramatic bets with our balance sheet.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital","And on the same token with growing your loan book, I know lot of people saying there is still a lot of price competition, is that the same thing keep me a powder dry for an opportunity to wind commercial yields to go up, you can take advantage of it?","William S. Demchak","Look we are -- if you go tracked your time notwithstanding the third quarter in C&I which I said was kind of anomalous, I think we are growing C&I to pace faster than all of our peers largely through winning new clients. A big part of that coming from the Southeast where we are new entrants beginning share. Spreads have declined in C&I lending and in real estate lending but they\u2019re still appreciably higher than they were in the tight periods in 2006-2007 and all that means is to get an adequate return for shareholders. We need to make sure that we are getting our fare share of cross sell with the clients that we are lending money to. And by the way we are doing that, you see it in corporate service fee line and other fee category lines where focus on growing customers across the full relationship not just lending.","Robert Q. Reilly","Which is now our strategy as you know for some time.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital","Okay, hey guys, thank you very much.","William H. Callihan","Thank you, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities, please go ahead.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Thanks, good morning. Bill you\u2019ve talked about deposit beaters likely being higher in the next rate cycle but given uncertainty around the timing of when those rate hikes will come, I was hoping you could separate new Fed rate moves from the impact of QE coming to an end? So X when your Fed rates moves do you think the end of QE will translate into a slowdown in overall industry deposit growth not necessarily deposits growth will turn negative but just a slowing of the growth, in kind of a post QE environment?","William S. Demchak","Yes, I think so. I think part of the issue and I am a little stale on this, I saw there is an article published or research piece published a couple of days ago and I didn\u2019t get through it. But I guess the notion of doing less of the (inaudible) facility would in fact cause the rundown of the Fed balance sheet to take a longer period of time than it otherwise might so the impact on deposit outflow in effect as QE goes away is slower than it might be. But that\u2019s all true right, then the need to chase deposits and have higher betas is somewhat muted. Now I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true. My fear and our worry is the Fed liquidity leaves the system and people compete for those deposits to comply with LCR, particularly the retail deposits that in other ways see higher deposit betas than you might have in past cycles. ","So we will see how that plays out. But you are right to assume that the roll off of QE and how the Fed balance sheet shrinks will have a different effect on deposit flows than just if and when the Fed rates is raised. ","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","And as a follow up to that, overall industry growth has been pretty decent and particularly in the commercial side, can you talk about how you guys are positioned for an environment where that deposit growth does slow and maybe the industry as a whole kind of the implications for that slowing of deposit growth but the continuation of the loan growth that we are seeing?","William S. Demchak","Yes, that is why we have been, I mean we planned different scenarios that you could have an environment where you have the utilization line increase on C&I loan. This is planned equipment expenditures finally come to life. So, very robust loan growth exactly at the time when the excess liquidity largely from large corporate kind of drains out of the system. You know and we plan I guess, that is one of the reasons we have on our own forecast and we did this at the last conference presentation we went through, we talk about the fact that for base planning our betas are a lot higher cause there is a possibility and you have this weird anomaly and this cycle where because of LCR certain deposits are worth more than others which is new. So, I don\u2019t know how that plays out. I just know we are supposed to focus on and run different scenarios against it which we do. ","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Great, that is really helpful. Thank you and if I can squeeze just one last one in, can you update us on what you are seeing in terms of any pockets within the commercial lending space where you find yourself just walking away because of the unattractive economics and then maybe the same question to the extent that anything stands out on the consumer side?","William S. Demchak","You know in the C&I space rather than industry what has been in the headlines and it is true as leverage lending continues to be at a place where we would view it as tough to make money is in a sight we don\u2019t plan the space. So it doesn\u2019t really matter to us so much. But that is kind of where the headlines are in C&I. We have also talked about this before, in small business, particularly small business that has a difficult ability to offer you fee streams. You know the increased tenor and tightened spreads in small business generically define if made somewhat less attractive than it once was. Most of the other stuff, you know, we have kept our credit box the same for since I have been at the company and we will compete with price inside of that credit box particularly for clients where we have a broad based relationship. We have large fee streams where to keep that client we will drop the spread on the loan to where we need to go. But those are still good loans. Bad loans, it doesn\u2019t matter what the price is, they are still bad loans. ","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Understood, thank you. ","William H. Callihan","Next question please. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Ken Usdin with Jefferies Group. Please go ahead. ","Ken Usdin - Jefferies Group","Thanks, good morning. ","William S. Demchak","Good morning Ken. ","Ken Usdin - Jefferies Group","Rob, I was wondering if I could just ask a couple of questions on expenses. First of all just this quarter your sequential growth was 1% in line I guess with the low single digit increase but I am just wondering did all those things you guys have talked about a quarter ago with regards to the CCAR spending and then the incremental spend come through this quarter and then when you think about fourth quarter, do you expect the same kind of growth rate, what kind of got flushed out in this quarter or didn\u2019t I guess is my first question?","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes, I understand Ken. Essentially in terms of the third quarter most of what we said and we expected did play out with one exception, that you recall I have mentioned the employee benefits. We had implemented a new high deductible plan in the beginning of the year that in effect back end of the corporate expense piece of that. We were expecting that through our projections arrive in the third quarter and that didn\u2019t. Not a big piece but that didn\u2019t but it does play into fourth quarter guidance where we do expect to see some increase in that category. But generally everything else occurred as we thought. Maybe a little lower than our guidance as I mentioned in my comments because you know with the acceleration of the continuous improvement program gains. ","Ken Usdin - Jefferies Group","Got it and then when you think ahead can you help us understand how that -- those investment spending and the incremental depreciation and amortization that is starting to get thrown off of it, how does that play against your ability to find incremental continuous improvement on top of what you\u2019ve already secured not just for this year, but as you also start to think about the years ahead?","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes sure, so again we won\u2019t get into 2015 guidance we\u2019ll do that as we usually do in our call in January. But generally speaking and you\u2019re familiar with it. So the continuous improvement program that we had in place for a number of years it works for us. It is a disciplined exercise where we identify expenses that we go after every year with the idea that in total they can fund our investments. So we would expect to be able to continue that in 2015, the program works well for us. It\u2019s not great for the outside world because it\u2019s hard to as you know take those numbers right through the income statement but it is a very useful tool that allows us to keep expense discipline in place particularly during time of revenue challenges. ","Ken Usdin - Jefferies Group","Okay and then just last piece on that then just the DNA piece, can you just help us understand how that does or does not cascade?","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes sure. Overtime depreciation will increase in our equipment line but as you know a lot of that is going to generate, a lot of those solutions overtime are going to generate efficiencies that we should be able to pick up in other areas.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies Group","Right, okay, got it. Thanks a lot.","William H. Callihan","Okay, next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Hi, good morning. Hi guys, Rob just wondering the fee income was very strong this quarter so the ability to stay flat sequentially seems like a nice positive. Could you give us some color on some of the foots and takes that you mentioned for the next quarter, you mentioned some seasonal items and how you stay you are thinking you might stay flattish.","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes, what I am really saying there is the elevated gains that we had from the M&A, the Harris William record performance, we don\u2019t necessarily expected those same levels. So the underlying growth in asset management, consumer services, and the corporate services I see in terms of the higher business activity that we\u2019re expecting to basically offset that. And that\u2019s where I get to stable.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, in the last two quarters you had 50 million or so other Visa gains, you expect to kind of keep harvesting those on a regular basis?","Robert Q. Reilly","Well we don\u2019t give specific guidance in terms of anything that we are going to do in the short term. We have been on the record saying that it is our intent to monetize the Visa. After the sale here in the third quarter we now have 7.4 million shares of the Class B, valued at 650 million on our books for 90 million. So unrealized gains of 560 million. ","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay and can you give us any color on what you are assuming in the provision outlook. Your reserves still look high relative to peers at the 1.7 you mentioned, are you assuming some reserve release continues but at a fading amount going forward and in charge of kind of stabilize?","Robert Q. Reilly","Assuming everything stays constant in terms of the environment that we are in, I would expect that we would have further releases although not necessarily at the levels that you know we\u2019ve had this year.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay and then the final thing from me, just some buybacks, what factors will drive your utilization or the remaining authorization you have for the two quarters left in the CCAR period?","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes, so we are half way through the program and we are about 40% in terms of our repurchases under the program rules. That amount that you didn\u2019t utilize in that particular given quarter can be carried into the future quarter. So we are committed to our buyback program, we\u2019ll continue with the program that we have and we would expect to repurchase more shares over the remaining two quarters of the program. ","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, just to be clear, are you saying you\u2019ll definitely use the whole thing for this year or is it kind of market and price dependent and other factors as well?","William S. Demchak","We are value buyers. Look at the 40% of the total promotion we did in the first half of the year. We have 60% left to go, our share price is 10 bucks lower, figure it out.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Alright, thanks guys.","William S. Demchak","That was Bill by the way.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","I get that. Thank you.","William H. Callihan","Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA, please go ahead.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Hi, how much more in savings do you have from the continuous improvement project?","Robert Q. Reilly","I am not sure I heard all that Mike, in terms of the continuous improvement program we had a target for 500 million through the year. We achieved that through the three quarters. So in that particular program we are in excess. We still have ideas that we will continue manage and continue to pursue and those that we can complete in the fourth quarter we will do and those that we can't will be part of our 2015 program. ","Mike Mayo - CLSA","So will the 2015 program have a new name or is this just going to be business as usual or what?","William S. Demchak","We are done with names. Basically we do it every year. You compile a list of opportunities that we track and hope people too and the savings from those Mike are basically what has allowed us to make these investments into our technology agenda and retail transformation. And actually at the same time is cutting expenses outright. So, it is just part of our annual budgeting and operating process.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Okay, and then as it relates to your financial targets, in the past you had targets for efficiency and ROE, do you have any targets currently or what kind of numbers do you want to achieve?","William S. Demchak","We don\u2019t have visible targets out there. I would tell you, you know the question on efficiency, you heard me say it is going to be driven by revenue increases, largely rate dependent. And many on the call have heard me say before we run cases here without efficiency ratio gets to impossibly low levels in the 40s in the right rate environment. In the side I don\u2019t think we can necessarily get there. I don\u2019t believe that financial projections but that's where the leverage is and that's -- therefore I don\u2019t want to set a target out when it is largely driven by a variable I don\u2019t control which is rates. We do know that we have the opportunity to be more efficient with the dollars we are spending and as you have seen we are intently focused on getting the most efficiency we can out of those. Generally focused on growing fee income which is within our control, which we are doing and we will play the environment out here. ","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Did I hear you right, so you think you can get to the efficiency in the 40s in the right rate environment?","William S. Demchak","No, so I am just saying we have run the cases right, so take it for what it is worth. It is a gigantic financial projection that basically says in this rate environment with the following deposit betas there is enough revenue leverage inside of our NII while remaining disciplined on expenses that you drive that ratio very low. And yes I have seen cases in the 40s. I have also for the public record I have told you that I do not believe those cases. But it is just materially better than where it is today, driven off of revenue and in particular off of NII. ","Robert Q. Reilly","Or in other words a major step down in efficiency ratio, we are going to need to rely on a different rate environment. ","William S. Demchak","Yes. ","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Okay, just one more follow up, do you think that we collectively should be expecting financial targets from companies such as yours. For example without an increase in interest rates, where the metrics should fall out, I mean PNC has performed better than the industry and Bill you have a good track record. So I think there is a certain degree of added trust. But having said that what should we as investors hold PNC accountable to in terms of financial results in the next one year or three years?","William S. Demchak","Look it is a fair question Mike, and it is something that I trouble myself with. The challenge we have, if you ought to hold us accountable to the things that we can control. Right, so it is market share, it is fees, it is transformation. It is getting the technology side right, it is controlling credit, it is being disciplined on expenses. I shouldn\u2019t be rewarded or at the extreme penalized on where rates go. We are inherently a cyclical business, right. And I could tell you which is why in my comments in a slide when I said for our planning cycle next year we assumed a rate rise in July and Fed funds at the end of the year at 1%. That's how we are going to measure ourselves. So, if that doesn\u2019t play out there is nothing I did or didn\u2019t do or the team did or didn\u2019t do, you know, against that success factor. ","So I get the need and the desire to want to have outright metrics. But people tend to forget and for the life of me I can't understand why that banking is a cyclical industry. ","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Alright, thanks a lot. ","William H. Callihan","Yes, next question please. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Terry McEvoy with Stern Agee. Please go ahead. ","Terry McEvoy - Stern Agee","Thanks, good morning. Bill do you remain as upbeat about the organic growth prospects in the Southeast for PNC and then as I look at the service charge line last quarter we had more customer transactions, you made some changes in the product offering, was that specific to the Southeast and what you are doing there or was that more broad based around your footprint?","William S. Demchak","Good questions. We continue to be really pleased with what we are seeing in the Southeast continued growth across all products and client types well in access of our legacy markets. That\u2019s a real and long-term organic growth opportunity for us, it is one of our core strategic priorities. Just in terms of the service charges, you may or may not remember that we were one of the last of the large banks to eliminate free check in and so a lot of that in the product line up is simply change in the product continuum and how people choose to pay for our retail banking product. So it\u2019s not an overdraft phase. I think even sequentially year-on-year fees are down and its coming in other forms. But by the way that\u2019s across the whole footprint. We have minor variations in some markets but generically it is across the whole footprint.","Terry McEvoy - Stern Agee","And then just as a follow-up, if I look at your commercial portfolio loans to manufacturing borrowers they are up the strongest year-over-year but flat quarter-over-quarter and was that just some quarter end volatility or was there a noticeable change that happened last year?","William S. Demchak","That\u2019s my guess. And my guess is that it is anomalous. We had some pay downs in our asset base lending group. You know things can be lumpy so we don\u2019t see a real change in where demand is coming from and the type of business we are winning. You know we picked at certain period of time and market-to-market at the end of the third quarter and it was flat rather than up a little bit.","Terry McEvoy - Stern Agee","Thank you very much.","William H. Callihan","Okay, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Two questions, first of all on loan growth, we had a lot of questions on commercial loan growth. I guess I am curious given some of the regulatory data that\u2019s come out over the quarter that seem to show a broadening of loan growth across consumer as well as more and more banks becoming a bit more willing to lend to the consumer that for your loan balances that look like it was a similar story this quarter versus the prior quarters of automobile continuing to grow but not much growth, in fact negative trends in most of the other consumer lines. Can you give us a sense as to sort of where you are seeing demand or in fact if PNC doesn\u2019t really die into most of the industry data in terms of consumer lending?","Robert Q. Reilly","That\u2019s right, I can answer some of that. Just if you break down the components of our consumer loans, the home equity product both align the credit and then term loans have been somewhat flattish for a while and we expect reasonably stay in that area. We have seen some growth in credit card. Bill mentioned that in terms of the year-over-year activity. We are relatively small player but expanded client base and expanded product aspects have that growing and we would expect that to continue to grow. You mentioned automobile, actually in automobile that growth in true consumer loan has been slowing. It is still growth, slowing and that\u2019s an example of maybe where we are backing off a little bit because of credit quality. It jumped in the quarter and that\u2019s largely a categorical anomaly. Its most of the jumps relates actually to a commercial customer with the underlying collateral is our consumer assets, a captive credit arm of a large domestic manufacturer. So, if you take that out the auto growth has been in the 1% range for the third quarter in direct and we would expect to sort of remain in that area.","William S. Demchak","The one thing I would add to that is, you got to remember we have some built runoff in our nonstrategic book which is what a billion and half bucks year-on-year. And we also have probably a comparatively larger student loan book that is in runoff mode given the change in educational lending. So we are kind of running inside the retail space, running to stay even. The other comment I\u2019d make is, a lot of that growth my suspicion has come on the back of balance sheeting residential mortgages which we do some of but again my best suspicion is materially less in some of our peers.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, that\u2019s helpful and then I\u2019m going to ask you a question in terms of expenses and I guess specifically you\u2019ve made a number of references to investing in the retail business, and I guess with some of the headlines related to cyber crime which haven\u2019t really -- haven\u2019t just focused on the biggest banks but have also referenced some of the regional banks, can you give us some metrics or some color as to how you are thinking about investment on that side of the equation specifically?","William S. Demchak","Yeah, sure. It is -- by the way we have been accessed for a while and it is part of our technology agenda which we have been pretty public about. Given some of the dialogue over the last week or so from some of the conferences, we actually kind of dug in to say how much inside of our technology agenda could be pointed to cyber and it is somewhat of a scary number. Just in terms of the size of the group we are focused on the investments we have and applications that helped both screen for bad traffic, knock out that traffic, and other things. And then added to that, a big part of our technology agenda is in the data center strategy where we just -- you know we are building more core resiliency which is another form of protection against cyber. The good news for you is that this is -- we had planned for this, we have been self funding it, it is a lot of money but it is nothing new for us. We kind of had assumed we needed to get better at this and throw a lot of resources at it at the better part of the year ago or more and had been on track to do so. ","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, that is helpful. Thank you very much. ","William H. Callihan","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Unidentified Analyst ","Hi everyone, this is actually Steve diving in for Gerard. Thanks for taking our call. Just two questions, first question is just on your capital planning, you are north of 10% common rate now, and last CCAR cycle you guys asked for 65% pay and received it, do you think you can get that to close to like 80% or 90% this time around?","William S. Demchak","We don\u2019t know. You know a couple of things, one is our -- the base case CCAR that we put into the process typically has a lower net income number than what we end up producing, whether it is because provisions are lower or we reduced the sales or any number of things. So, the payout ratio that we ask for inside of our base case is higher than the 60% and we end up making more money. So, our actual ends up lower. We clearly are in a situation where absent building our payout you know upwards towards a 100% we are generating capital at a pace that is beyond our ability to intelligently deploy it with our customers which weren\u2019t the case but it is. We got to figure out a way to return more to shareholders. So that will be a topic of discussion inside of this company and many others I suspect as we go into CCAR this year but without guidance from Fed as yet, nothing we can say about it formally.","Unidentified Analyst ","Fair enough, thank you. And last question, your mobile banking channel, do you have the percentage of customers that are using your mobile to banking channel and where do you expect that number to go hopefully by the end of 2015?","William S. Demchak","So we are making disclosure on all the digital, all the non-predominantly. 47% of our customers are predominantly non-branched clients so we have 1 percentage -- 36% of our deposits are now non-teller, so either the ATM or the mobile phone. And that number has grown leaps and bounds but I would tell you it is below what some of our peers do today. So, I would expect that we could get upwards of 50%. We were little bit slower than some of the very large banks in the roll out of image ATMs. So we are playing a little bit of catch up against some of the leaders in that space even while we are far ahead of some of our smaller competitors. ","Unidentified Analyst ","Great. ","Robert Q. Reilly","Okay continue please.","Unidentified Analyst ","You are 36%, you are 36% right now for non-teller and you said that some of your competitors do you know or you have got a sense of how high they are at for the non-teller, is it 50%?","William S. Demchak","Yes, I remember seeing a 50. I will do my own research on that before you trust my number, but I remember seeing a 50% of somebody.","Unidentified Analyst ","Great, thanks very much for taking our call. ","Robert Q. Reilly","Yeah, sure. ","William H. Callihan","With that, that wrap up the Q&A. Bill do you have any closing comments before we sign off.","William S. Demchak","No again, appreciate everybody's time this morning. We feel pretty good about the quarter executing on kind of what we set out to do, notwithstanding the revenue environment. I look forward to a quarter when we can actually announce on a day when the market doesn\u2019t open up down 300 points. But so be it and we look forward to talking to you guys at the end of the year. Thank you. ","William H. Callihan","With that operator we are going to conclude the call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bill Callihan. Sir, please go ahead.","William H. Callihan","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Demchak, and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Our forward-looking statements regarding PNC performance assume a continuation of the current economic trends and do not take into account the impact of potential legal and regulatory contingencies. Actual results and future events could differ possibly materially from those anticipated in our statements and from our historical performance due to a variety of risks and other factors.","Information about such factors, as well as GAAP reconciliation and other information on non-GAAP financial measures we discuss, is included in today's conference call, earnings release and related presentation materials, and in our 10-K, 10-Q, and various other SEC filings and investor materials. These are all available on our corporate Web-site, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of October 14, 2015 and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Demchak.","William S. Demchak","Thanks, Bill, and good morning everybody. I just have a few brief comments this morning before I turn it over to Rob. You will have seen today that we reported net income of $1.1 billion or $1.90 per diluted common share for the third quarter, which compares to $1 billion or $1.88 per diluted common share for the second quarter of 2015 and a $1 billion or $1.79 per diluted common share for the third quarter of 2014.","Importantly, the $1.90 this quarter included $65 million of a net tax reserve release which added about $0.12 to our reported results. Beyond this line item, it was kind of just an okay quarter for us. I was pleased to see both core and reported NII up this quarter but was disappointed at the Fed's decision to leave rates unchanged at the end of September. This delay and the subsequent dubious statements from various Fed governors will at best delay our ability to grow NII materially in the future.","Importantly, we were able to keep core NIM fairly stable this quarter as loan and security yields held constant. You will have seen that we gave up a couple of basis points on continued liquidity build, but this is largely behind us at this point. Loan growth was flat, which is reflective of the competitive market, but also the fact that we exited over $1 billion of non-LCR friendly assets during the quarter, and this runoff was largely offset by continued growth in our specialty segments.","You will also notice that our investment securities increased by $6.7 billion this quarter, largely funded by the deposit growth of $5.3 billion. It's worth pointing out that despite this increase, our duration of equity actually became even more negative given the lower rate environment.","You will have seen that fee income was softer than we expected this quarter, partly due to the markets and a strong second quarter comparison. However, they are up 3% year to date versus the same period of 2014 and we believe that we'll be able to continue to grow fee income over time through the ongoing execution of our strategic priorities.","Importantly, expenses were down slightly linked quarter, even with the extra day of business, and I would be remiss if I didn't say how pleased I am to see our employees across the organization respond so well to our efficiency imperative. We continue to maintain strong capital and liquidity positions and returned capital to shareholders through repurchases of 6.2 million common shares during the third quarter.","Now this is our 10th consecutive quarter of $1 billion or more net income and I'm proud that we've been able to deliver such consistent performance through time with virtually no wind at our backs. Now I know at this point in the year, you are all looking towards 2016, and while we haven't completed our budget process, I can tell you broadly that we expect our strategic priorities will continue to drive growth in fee income, and as I mentioned before net interest income growth is going to be challenging until rates begin to move up.","Because of that, we'll continue to focus aggressively on managing expenses. We expect credit costs will gradually return to normal levels. With all of this, despite the challenges that we and the rest of the industry continue to face in the current environment, I do like how PNC is positioned. I continue to believe we have the right model, capabilities, culture and people to continue to manage what is in our power to control and to deliver for the customer, shareholders and communities that we serve.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our third quarter results, and then we'll take your questions. Rob?","Robert Q. Reilly","Thanks, Bill, and good morning everyone. Overall, our third quarter results played out largely consistent with our expectations. Third quarter net income was $1.1 billion or $1.90 per diluted common share, with $0.13 of that related to tax reserve activity. These results also were driven by core growth in net interest income, continued increases in deposits and well-controlled expenses. Importantly, during the quarter, we maintained strong capital levels while delivering significant shareholder capital return.","Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. As you can see, total assets increased by $5.9 billion or 2% compared to the second quarter. Total loans were down slightly linked quarter for reasons I will highlight. However, compared to the same quarter a year ago, total loans increased approximately $5 billion or 3%, primarily due to growth in commercial loans and in particular large corporate and commercial real estate lending.","During the third quarter, commercial lending was up approximately $100 million as new production, again primarily in commercial real estate, was partially offset by the impact of ongoing capital and liquidity management activities. Consumer lending decreased approximately $650 million and about two-thirds of that was due to the runoff in the non-strategic consumer loan portfolio. Offsetting this decline somewhat in the quarter was growth in credit card and indirect auto loans.","Investment securities were up $2.6 billion or 4% linked quarter. On a spot basis, investment securities increased $6.7 billion or 11% compared to June 30 as we purchased securities near quarter end. These were primarily agency, residential, mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities, substantially funded by the deposit growth we experienced in the quarter.","Our interest-earning deposits primarily with the Federal Reserve were $37.3 billion, an increase of $15.2 billion or 69% compared to the same time a year ago, in part to comply with the liquidity coverage standards but also reflecting strong deposit growth. As of September 30, our estimated short term liquidity coverage ratio exceeded 100% for both the Bank and the Bank holding company under the month-end calculation methodology.","On the liability side, total deposits increased by $5.6 billion or 2% when compared to the second quarter. During the third quarter, we saw continued growth in deposits from consumers. However, most of the increase was driven by growth in commercial balances. Compared to the third quarter of last year, total deposits increased by $19.6 billion or 9%.","Turning to capital, as of September 30, 2015, our pro forma Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, fully phased in and using the standardized approach, was estimated to be 10.1%, up 10 basis points linked-quarter primarily due to retained earnings.","During the third quarter, we repurchased 6.2 million common shares for approximately $600 million. We are on track to meet our repurchase authorization of up to $2.875 billion for the five quarter period which began April 1, 2015. Period-end common shares outstanding were 510 million, down 18 million compared to the same time a year ago. Finally, our tangible book value reached $63.37 per common share as of September 30, a 7% increase compared to the same period a year ago.","Turning to our income statement on Slide 5, and again net income was $1.1 billion and our return on average assets was 1.19%. Let me highlight a few key components in our third quarter income statement. Core net interest income increased by $31 million, driven by increased securities balances and an additional day in the quarter, partially offset by lower purchase accounting accretion. As a result, total net interest income increased $10 million compared to the second quarter.","Core net interest margin was essentially flat linked-quarter at 2.57%. Total NIM was 2.67% in the third quarter, a decline of 6 basis points from second quarter, primarily due to lower purchase accounting. Regarding purchase accounting accretion, our estimate for the fourth quarter is approximately $75 million of net interest income, and if that plays out, we expect full-year PAA to be down approximately $180 million to $200 million compared to 2014.","Total noninterest income decreased by $101 million or 6% compared to the second quarter, primarily due to higher second quarter gains on asset sales including Visa shares and loans and securities. Total fee income declined $41 million or 3% as growth in most categories was more than offset by lower fee revenue in asset management and residential mortgage.","Asset management fees decreased by $40 million or 10% on a linked-quarter basis following an elevated second quarter due to a $30 million trust settlement. In addition, third quarter equity market decline contributed to the overall decrease. As a result, assets under administration were $256 billion as of September 30, down $3 billion compared to the same period a year ago. However, net client flows were up both linked-quarter and compared to the same quarter a year ago.","Reflecting our strategy of growing share of wallet in retail, consumer services fees were up $7 million or 2% linked-quarter with all categories posting quarterly increases. Service charges on deposits grew by $16 million or 10% linked quarter due in part to seasonally higher customer activity. Corporate services fees increased by $15 million or 4% linked quarter, primarily due to elevated merger and acquisition advisory fees, higher corporate finance fees and increased treasury management activities.","Residential Mortgage noninterest income declined by $39 million or 24% linked quarter as a result of lower net hedging gains on mortgage servicing rights and lower fair value marks. However, originations compared to the same quarter a year ago were up 5%. Other noninterest income decreased $43 million, primarily related to lower gains on the sale of Visa Class B common shares in the third quarter compared to the second quarter.","Noninterest expense declined $14 million or 1% linked quarter and was down $5 million compared to the same quarter a year ago. Both periods reflected our continued focus on expense management. On a linked quarter basis, the decrease was primarily the result of lower expenses related to third-party services.","As you know, the goal of our 2015 Continuous Improvement Program is to reduce costs to fund the investments we are making primarily in technology infrastructure and retail transformation. During the second quarter, we increased our annual CIP target to $500 million. We're now nine months into the year and we have completed actions related to capturing 75% of our annual goal, and as a result we remain confident we will achieve our full year objectives. Provision in the third quarter was $81 million for reasons I'll review when we discuss credit.","Finally, our third quarter effective tax rate was 20%, down from 28.2% in the second quarter. Our third quarter tax expense reflected tax benefits and addition to reserves, the largest components of which were a benefit of $75 million attributable to effectively settling acquired entity tax contingencies, offset by additions to reserves of $10 million for various tax matters. Looking ahead, we expect our fourth quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 26%.","Turning to Slide 6, overall credit quality remained relatively stable in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. Nonperforming loans were down $75 million or 3% compared with the second quarter, driven by improvements in the consumer lending portfolio. Total past-due loans increased by $22 million or 1% linked quarter as we saw small uptick in some categories.","Net charge-offs at $96 million increased by $29 million primarily due to elevated recoveries we experienced in the second quarter. Gross charge-off levels remained consistent with prior quarters. In the third quarter, the net charge-off ratio was 19 basis points of average loans, up from 13 basis points in the prior quarter.","Our provision of $81 million was within the expectations we had provided for the quarter and reflect higher reserve requirements including oil and gas. Looking ahead, we expect our provision for the fourth quarter to remain in the $50 million to $100 million range. The allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans is 1.58% as of September 30. This compares to 1.59% linked quarter and 1.7% at the same time a year ago.","As disclosed in our second quarter 10-Q filing, in anticipation of the end of the life of our purchase impaired pooled consumer loans, we are evaluating our de-recognition policies. These loans now total less than $4 billion with reserves of approximately $750 million at September 30.","In the fourth quarter, we expect to remove from our pools loans that have been paid off, sold, foreclosed or have nominal value. We estimate this policy change will reduce fourth quarter 2015 total loan balances and associated allowance for loan losses each by approximately $475 million. As all loans to be removed from these loan pools have been fully reserved for, there will be no impact to EPS, the net carrying value of the pools or accretion accounting, nor will this change result in an additional provision for credit losses.","Lastly, a quick update on our oil and gas exposure. We have a total of $2.6 billion in outstandings, which was down modestly quarter over quarter. This represents approximately 2% of our total commercial loan book. Within the oil services portfolio, which totals approximately $900 million of the $2.6 billion, approximately $225 million of that is not asset-based or investment grade and this is the portion of the portfolio that we are most concerned about.","We did experience some performance deterioration in the quarter and as a result incurred some elevated charge-offs. During the third quarter, we increased our reserves to reflect the incremental impact of lower oil and gas prices, and going forward we continue to actively monitor the portfolio for additional changes.","In summary, PNC posted third quarter earnings consistent with our expectations. We continue to believe the domestic economy will expand at a steady pace this year driven by strong consumer confidence and improvements in the U.S. economy and job market. Obviously, the Federal Reserve did not raise short-term interest rates in September as we expected. Our plans now assume an increase in December. However, we acknowledge that a rate rise in 2015 is a close call.","Given this background, we expect full year revenues in 2015 to continue to be under pressure and we expect total expenses to be down approximately 1% compared to full year 2014. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter and when compared to third quarter reported results, we expect modest loan growth, we expect net interest income to remain stable, we expect fee income to be stable as we anticipate continued growth in business activity in the fourth quarter to be somewhat offset by the elevated merger and acquisition advisory fees we have recorded in the third quarter, we expect expenses to be stable and we expect provision to be between $50 million and $100 million.","And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.","William S. Demchak","So, operator, if you could give our participants the instructions please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Betsy Graseck","I just wanted to follow-up on your comments around expecting the Fed is going to raise rates potentially in December and then maybe you could talk about what you've got baked in for next year's outlook and give us some indication as to what the plans are in the event that they don't come through as you are currently budgeting for?","Robert Q. Reilly","This is Rob, and I should say this straight up for the call, we're going to refrain from 2016 guidance, but I can give you a general sense. As I mentioned in the prepared comments, we do have built into our plans the rate rise in December. Admittedly that's a close call. The revenue impact of what happens in 2015 or doesn't happen in 2015 is pretty insubstantial. In 2016 it does become substantial as you know, and if in fact rates don't rise, it will just make growing revenues that much tougher in 2016 than it would be if rates did in fact rise.","Betsy Graseck","I guess I was just wondering, because I know you do have some investment spend going on and in particular in some of the IT that's coming to fruition in the middle of next year, I'm just wondering how you think about dropping any of that to the bottom line versus what you've done this year. I know you've spent most of your cost saves reinvesting in the business. Is that how you're thinking about next year as well or is there any room for dropping some of the expense saves that you've been generating along the way to the bottom line when they happen?","Robert Q. Reilly","I'll let you know just in terms of the expense discussion, it's been \u2013 expense management has been a focus point for us and we've been doing pretty well. Our philosophy has been these last couple of years to in effect take the expense savings that we're generating to fund the investments that we are making in technology and the retail bank transformation. We expect those investments to continue into 2016. We will have a continuous improvement program in 2016. We are not there yet in terms of numbers because we haven't done our budgeting, but the philosophy will be the same.","William S. Demchak","I think the notion of would we drop \u2013 if what you're asking is, would we forego tech spend and slow down our investments because of the near-term environment, the answer is no. At the margin, we stretch things out a little bit in certain places but to make a change in strategic direction in technology as a function of near-term rate outlook doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.","Betsy Graseck","I get that. I just thought that some of the tech spend will come to fruition over the next 12 to 18 months, is that right, that you've got\u2026","William S. Demchak","In the sense that it will be behind us or\u2026?","Betsy Graseck","In the sense that some of the big projects that you've got will be completed.","William S. Demchak","Yes, but what happens on the expense line, so we will \u2013 as we are completing the work, the capital expenditure is turning into ongoing expense through depreciation. So even though we might be done with the actual work, you're not going to see a drop in our tech spend line because it's going to roll through time in the depreciation line.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, I got it.","William S. Demchak","But what you will see is a continuation of kind of occupancy down, tech up and people down, the compensation costs as we kind of go through that transformation.","Betsy Graseck","All right, that's great, thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Please proceed.","Scott Siefers","If you could spend a second talking or kind of expanding upon your comments on the rate situation, if indeed we are going to be lower for potentially a lot longer, does that change the way you've been thinking about managing the balance sheet? For example, capital hit could be less of an issue if rates are going to stay low, so does that change your thoughts on the securities portfolio, could you sort of extend that with swaps, stuff like that?","William S. Demchak","So there is no immediate thought to change anything. Obviously if rates were to stay at these levels forever, then we could invest the excess balances both in Level 1 and some capacity we have in Level 2 securities. We don't think that's going to be the case. We do think it's going to be delayed.","With respect to the issue in a rising rate environment, the capital hit we have taken in AOCI, we stress for that anyway inside of the CCAR exam and have plenty of capital to absorb that. So that doesn't really drive our decision as to how much we invest or not, it's more a function of kind of long term value I guess where we expect rates will be through time.","Scott Siefers","Okay, all right, that's helpful. And then maybe just a quick question on the fee side, just as you look at things, fee momentum has been such an important offset to the tougher NII environment. If you look at sort of the weaker than expected trends this quarter, to what extent you can say they are kind of transitory versus to what extent do you think that they are sort of controllable such that you can regain the kind of momentum you've had in the past several quarters?","William S. Demchak","A bunch of it was transitory in the sense against the second quarter comparison we had that big trust fee in wealth management which made the comparison tough. We also just at the end of the quarter with some volatility in rates dropped some of the valuation benefit we would have had in mortgage. So that will go away. I mean the one issue that we don't control is the beta that shows up through not only our wealth management segment but also the BlackRock income that we record and obviously that hurt our results this quarter, just the drop in equity values. Beyond that, the core fee momentum that we're seeing in consumer and corporate services, which are the biggest drivers, remains really strong and we think that will continue.","Scott Siefers","Okay, all right, that sounds great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Matt O\u2019Connor","If I were to follow up on the balance sheet question, honing in both on the liquidity but also just broadening it out, you've got a lot of liquidity, a lot of deposits, a lot of capital, not as many loans relative to your balance sheet as peers, and I get that you don't want to add $34 billion of securities all at once or even kind of over the next several quarters, but what are you thinking about on the loan book what you can do there maybe strategically a little different to deploy some of that liquidity and boost the revenues over time?","William S. Demchak","It's a fair question. As I mentioned, inside of what looked like a flat quarter on loan growth, we have been trimming certain exposures that are LCR and capital unfriendly. That slows through time and growth will take back over. I would tell you that we have looked strategically at some of the loan heavy businesses that have recently been sold. Unfortunately we haven't been able to execute on any of those, but the right business with the right risk profile that would be synergistic to what we already do, we would take a look at, we just haven't been able to do that at a price that makes sense to us.","Beyond that, again carrying the extra capital and the extra liquidity to the extent that it's not burning a hole in our pocket and causing us to do something stupid with it, doesn't have a lot of \u2013 doesn't cause a lot of long-term value deterioration, it is there as an option as things change going forward.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Yes, I think it was that optionality that I was really kind of trying to get at. And if you had to rank in terms of like why loan growth isn't more, is it weak demand, bad pricing, concern on the terms, I'm sure it's a combination of all three, but like what would the pecking order be?","William S. Demchak","Interestingly, spreads have kind of stabilized inside the core middle-market commercial space. We continue to see growth in the specialty segments. We see growth that's M&A related. Part of what we're seeing I think in loan demand was the general slowdown in sentiment in the third quarter on corporate kind of coming on the back of both the volatility coming out of China and in the markets and then Jerry Allen statements on kind of the economy. So I think some of the last quarter's performance was just reflective of the environment in the third quarter versus the second and that can change through time.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, all right, thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR & Co. Please proceed.","Paul J. Miller","We're just wondering, I know you guys have less than 2% energy exposure, but in some of these markets that you're seeing, is there any distress in the overall economics of some of these towns that you are in because of the lower commodity prices?","William S. Demchak","Nothing that's hit. So I get where you're going. We've seen lower energy prices hit energy companies directly following through to energy suppliers. We're not heavy \u2013 I imagine that's the case probably down in parts of Texas. I don't know that we're seeing that in any of the markets that are a core part of our footprint.","Robert Q. Reilly","And I would just add that our [economists points out] [ph] that the lower gas prices are a net benefit to PNC in most of the markets on the consumer side.","Paul J. Miller","On the consumer side. I'm just worried about some of the derivatives. I know parts of Pennsylvania have been really good with resellers, and I'm just wondering if this is reverse of some of those areas' economics.","William S. Demchak","Interestingly it hasn't really. I think partly because a lot of the cuts we saw in capital hit traditional oil as opposed to necessarily what's going on in the natural gas markets, so that while it hasn't increased, they haven't really pulled back so much locally. As you said Pittsburgh for example continues to increase its employment role and capital spend in our region despite what's going on in energy.","Paul J. Miller","And then can you talk a little bit about the RBC acquisition? I know that's been for a couple of years now, I know it still probably doesn't move the needle, but is it still in the double-digit growth phase and what type of experience you have seen down there?","Robert Q. Reilly","This is Rob. Continued strong performance, very consistent with say the trajectory that we've been on, we're pleased we're up and running in each of those markets with our full model, our brand awareness in those markets is approaching our brand awareness in our legacy markets, and just about in every category and in every business the growth rates are accretive to our legacy businesses, in some cases just by the nature that it's a relatively small base but also consistent with what we intended to do there.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please proceed.","Gerard Cassidy","A bigger picture question for you, Bill. Obviously your return on asset number is pretty good in this environment around 119 basis points, the return on equity number is less than 10%. Can you give us a view of what you're thinking with the return of excess capital? None of the banks have been willing to ask for more than earnings in the CCAR process. Maybe the excess capital could be used for acquisitions once you feel comfortable that when you read what MNC went through and what the Fed said about the application process, what you guys need to \u2013 you as an industry not just PNC, but what everybody needs to be at in terms of getting a big deal done internally in system CRA, CCAR, et cetera, so could you give us the picture if this environment doesn't change much where you guys are real good on credit, you're not going to overextend yourself on the growth, you don't get much benefit from interest rates, how do you take it to the next level with the capital picture, acquisitions and return of capital?","William S. Demchak","So in simple form your question is, what do you do with the capital trap that exists in a business or an industry that in effect can generate capital at a pace that at least in my view we can intelligently deploy it in the core franchise?","Gerard Cassidy","Correct.","William S. Demchak","So our bias look has been and will continue to be and we'll continue to push on the limit to which you can return capital through the CCAR process. You've heard me say before that in some ways we are restricted because our base case submission typically has lower total income than we earn because it doesn't count some of the line items that show up in our reported earnings. But we're going to push on that and I would tell you that there is no explicit, you can't go beyond a 100, they've been very clear with us on that, and for various reasons people have chosen not to push it.","Outside of that, you heard me in one of the prior questions, if we could find asset generating business within our risk profile that are synergistic to the rest of our business, we'd pursue those. I don't know that those are necessarily in the traditional retail bank acquisition space but some of the things you've seen come to the market out of one big seller in the headlines recently were appealing to us. So we think about that a lot, and you're absolutely right, we're generating capital and have capital beyond a place that we need today to run the Company.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. And the follow-up, Rob, maybe you can share with us, you touched on your oil portfolio and we recognize that's only 2% of the commercial loan book, have you guys done any stress testing? Yesterday J.P. Morgan suggested they stress-tested their portfolio down to $30 a barrel and the results were not that bad relative to the size of their book. Have you guys done anything like that?","Robert Q. Reilly","We've done a little bit, Gerard, not to the same extent that J.P. has. I saw and heard those same comments. Again, less than 2% of our total commercial loan book, less than 1.5% of our total loan book, so relatively small dollar amount. So we have done some stress testing at various price levels and nothing major in terms of outside relative to the enterprise.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.","John Pancari","Just back to the loan growth question again, I know in the past you've alluded to the focus on some of the loan only relationships you've had and accordingly you were a little bit more cautious in growing your pure midmarket type of relationships if you couldn't secure the fees. So can you just update us, is that conservative posture or that approach at all still impacting your loan growth at all in the commercial bucket?","William S. Demchak","Sure it is. By the way I don't know that that's conservative, I think that's rational. I mean what we're effectively saying is extend credit on a relationship basis that covers your cost of capital. So in an environment today where inside the C&I space our net charge-offs are effectively zero and have been for the last couple of years, you could make any loan and it looks good, it drops to the bottom line, but we don't expect today's charge-off levels and reserve ratios to hold through time, and once you normalize back to whatever that's supposed to be, 40 or 50 basis points, these marginal loans don't look so good if you're not getting the related fee income that come with them. By the way, that's nothing different. We've done that since the first day I got here 13 years ago. That's the model we pursue.","John Pancari","Okay, all right. And then separately, on the expense side, just want to get a little bit of an update on your expectation around the efficiency ratio. I mean we're at 62% here. How should we think about where that can trend through 2016 given the expense areas that you're still focusing on?","Robert Q. Reilly","As you know we don't have an explicit target in terms of the efficiency ratio. We do have a disciplined expense management effort in place which is in terms of our guidance going to work our year-over-year expenses down a bit. So I think generally efficiency ratio, we are in the neighborhood that we are now and are likely to be there, a substantial step-down in that we are going to need some help from rates.","John Pancari","Okay, and then how would you \u2013 [indiscernible] but how would you quantify substantial step-down?","William S. Demchak","I mean give us a rate environment. The efficiency ratio runs well into the 50s in the normalized rate curve, so unfortunately we just don't see that happening in the near-term.","John Pancari","Right, so if we get a one and done or just a modest hike and then it slows, could you see [indiscernible]?","William S. Demchak","[Indiscernible], I mean those all help. If you think about it, we're running at 62 this quarter, we managed to hold core NIM flat, we're going to [heat on] [ph] purchase accounting in 2016, I don't know if we've put a number on it.","Robert Q. Reilly","[Indiscernible] but less than 200.","William S. Demchak","It's 200 this year, it will be less next year, so that's a drop in revenue, we'll fight that with fees, try to hold expenses flat. I mean it's not \u2013 until rates move, our ability to materially grow the Company and therefore improve our efficiency ratio is a struggle. We do it through expense management, we do it through fee growth and the things that we can control and focus on, and that's what we're doing.","John Pancari","Got it, okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Erika Najarian","My questions have been asked and answered.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Ken Usdin","Just a couple of quick cleanups if you don't mind. So again staying away from the next year full-year but just coming back to Bill your comments about with that rates kind of tough to grow NII, assuming you're talking about kind of an on basis, Rob, do you just have kind of even to help us out understand the expected PAA decline next year after the 180 to 200 that you are expecting for this year?","Robert Q. Reilly","Ken, just what we just said there on the last question, we don't have a 2016 number for you but by definition it will be less than the decline we experienced this year which is the 180 to 200.","Ken Usdin","So if we just start, I guess if we just started ending at 70 and I ran it across 280 versus from that 300\u2026?","Robert Q. Reilly","That's a good approach. The delta is around the recoveries as you know which can be plus or minus 15 million or so.","Ken Usdin","Okay, that's what I wanted to clarify. Okay, mortgage gain on sale was \u2013 you have that bigger number just the way you calculated it, it's back down to 2.8% now. Has it found a new level here or any trends to discern in terms of do we have stability around that upper 2s gain on sale margin?","Robert Q. Reilly","I don't think so, Ken. I think we guide to 300 which I think is the number that is the best number going forward. We see a lot of volatility in terms of those basis points because they are relatively small numbers, but the prior quarter at 3.20-ish down to 2.80-ish was all a result of the combination of that delta between the fair value marks and the RMSR hedge gains that Bill referenced. Loan production and servicing were actually pretty flat.","Ken Usdin","Right, okay. And then the last one just you mentioned that corporate services was helped by some pretty big M&A fees in the third quarter and I think you kind of alluded to that being down in the fourth, but isn't Harris Williams typically strong at the end of the year and I'm just wondering can you give us kind of a little bit of an update on what's happening within the pieces of those major businesses within corporate services and has something changed that you wouldn't see that typical year-end strengthen in Harris Williams?","Robert Q. Reilly","It's a good question. We did see the rise in the third quarter level of Harris Williams which was a great increase. Some of the fee back there was some of the deals got pulled in that typically would have otherwise been in the fourth quarter got pulled into the third quarter for timing reasons on the client side. So it just has a little bit in terms of our projections is more sort of in that stable overall because that if in fact that was what would otherwise have been fourth quarter, we don't make up for it.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And then last one, I know we'll get some of this in the Q, but inside Asset Management, obviously the second to third was affected by that 30 million trust recovery that you mentioned. Can you just kind of help us understand core PNC Asset Management versus the BlackRock?","Robert Q. Reilly","Flat to down-ish a bit. So setting the trust settlement aside, down a couple of million dollars.","Ken Usdin","On the core PNC?","Robert Q. Reilly","On the core, yes.","Ken Usdin","Okay, all right, understood. Thanks guys.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.","Matthew H. Burnell","First of all, Rob, maybe a question for you, a question on loan commitments appear to be growing a little bit faster than loans, I'm curious if there is any specific areas where those are growing faster. You mentioned commercial real estate being an area where you are making some good momentum in terms of loan growth, but just curious if I'm right suggesting that commercial real estate is an area where you are growing commitments. And I guess to Bill's earlier comment about generating fee revenue off that, how successful have you been with those new relationships in terms of driving fee income?","Robert Q. Reilly","I think generally speaking in answer to your first question around just sort of where commitments are rising, it is generally still mentioned that our specialty businesses within corporate banking. In answering your second question in terms of how is it going in terms of building out those relationships, we think it's going well. A big part of that obviously is for the growth in the fee income that you see in the corporate services line, so not just Harris Williams but obviously treasury management and corporate finance fees were good in the quarter, and that's where you see most of those sort of ancillary services sold into those relationships.","Matthew H. Burnell","Rob, and then my follow-up really is on the interest bearing costs, those are up a couple of basis points quarter over quarter. Is there anything you're doing on the deposit side in terms of targeting specific areas or certain products that is pushing that cost of interest bearing liabilities up?","William S. Demchak","A couple of things. First on the deposit gathering side, we have been in many of our markets at the high end of rate paid in order to get ahead of LCR and liquidity needs, particularly if and when rates start to go up, so some of that shows up there. The other thing that's happened is that the change in Moody's methodology as it relates to how they rate banks has caused us to have to increase our wholesale funding in bank notes at the bank level and the whole industry has done that and you've seen spreads gap out pretty aggressively for wholesale funding of banks. So I'm sure that that is playing into that number. So I think it's up 2 basis points quarter on quarter. I don't know that you'll see that \u2013 as I said before, we're pretty far along and done on what we need to do on the liquidity side, so hopefully that's behind us.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please proceed.","Bill Carcache","Some of the banks that have reported so far are showing loan growth, paced deposit growth and more broadly we have recently also started seeing that dynamic in the [HA] [ph] data. However, you guys continue to generate very healthy deposit growth in excess of your loan growth. Do you have any thoughts on what may be driving that?","William S. Demchak","Our deposit growth is purposeful, it's largely retail-based, although even our C&I deposits are growing pretty aggressively, and we're doing it to get ahead of \u2013 as Rob mentioned, we are over the 100% threshold on holding company and bank for LCR, which is ahead of the compliance period. I don't know if our peers are in fact there yet. We thought it's important to get in front of that. So almost independent of what we do on loans, deposit growth was purposeful and accomplished.","On the loan side, we have a bit of a mix shift. As I mentioned, on the C&I side, we are exiting some things that are LCR unfriendly and things that are lending on the relationships with tight spreads. We continue to grow the specialty segments and have been even this quarter offset pretty aggressive runoff on the non-LCR side. I think we dropped 1.2 billion in LCR unfriendly and we managed to have a net positive C&I growth. So if you did the math on that, you'd annualize that to about a 4% growth rate in C&I.","Retail, it's a struggle because we're running off educational loans, the discontinued segment, kind of trading water and home equity with some growth coming through in credit card and auto.","Robert Q. Reilly","And then down in education.","William S. Demchak","And down in education as the government loans run down. So I don't \u2013 purposefully changing our C&I or retail growth trajectory at this point beyond what you're seeing, absent the runoffs, I think would change our risk bucket and I don't think that's the right thing to do.","By the way, one of the things you'd see through time, if you went and you target our loan growth through time against peers, you would see that during the crisis and just after the crisis, we grew loans much more aggressively than everybody else, kind of the best time to make loans is when nobody else is making them, at the highest spreads and what we've been focused on as spreads have contracted and competition has got more aggressive is retaining relationships and cross-selling relationships, that's just why you're seeing the acceleration in our fee income.","So it doesn't mean we're not going to grow loans, it doesn't mean we're not going to pursue new relationships, but dollars to the bottom line in terms of degree of difficulty, it's easier today to grow fees than it is to pursue economically attractive loans.","Bill Carcache","Thanks Bill. If I could follow up along these lines, you mentioned last quarter that you wouldn't be surprised if you guys were picking up some of the non-operating deposits that some of the larger banks were deemphasizing. Can you give us an update on where you think some of those non-operating deposits are going and perhaps why you might see value in accepting them?","William S. Demchak","I mean I'm sure some of the growth we've seen in our C&I deposits reflect that. We have room inside of our leverage ratio to be able to accept those deposits and we accept them and pay a rate on them where we earn a margin even against the excess balances at the Fed. So maybe it drops our ROA at the margin and NIM at the margin but it's riskless dollars to the bottom line and it doesn't affect \u2013 like I said, we had room inside of our leverage ratio, so it's fine.","Robert Q. Reilly","And it's often in the context of a relationship that we have.","Bill Carcache","Understood. And then finally if I can, a related longer-term question, Bill, on competition for deposits, some believe that the industry's core loan to deposit ratio is higher than what it would appear to be on a reported basis once you factor in deposit outflow risk under LCR, and with that [recent age] [ph] data dynamic that we talked about showing loan growth now, pacing deposit growth across the large banks, do you think there's a chance that we could actually start to see competition for deposit intensify a bit independent of the Fed raising rates?","William S. Demchak","I do. It's one of the reasons we got out ahead of it. So we are in the camp that when people start to figure out what LCR is and the compliance period, it comes into play that retail deposits are going to matter and there's going to be a tough fight for it.","Bill Carcache","Great, that's really helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please proceed.","Mike Mayo","If interest rates stay lower for longer, you made it clear that you will not take extra risk, you will not cut tech spending and you will not cut strategic spending, so what are your levers to better control expenses if revenues wind up weaker than expected?","William S. Demchak","First just the tech spending and the strategic spending are self funded and in fact cause savings on the other side. So if you think about the spending we are doing like inside of the branch rebuild, we are effectively dropping people. So people cost, occupancy cost as we drop branches has been replaced by technology cost, right. I think it's better for customers long-term, it has a better long-term growth trend and it's expense neutral. So if I cut the technology cost, I'm left back with my people cost, if you follow me.","The same thing, a lot of the tech spend that we are spending in automating systems and applications and core processes that are in many cases manual today on the back of new regulation, so again we are sort of investing into long-term efficiency without a lot of near term paying. We've been able to self-fund it as we go forward.","Rob's comment on it is there much to do outright on the expense side, is that going to be a driver of longer-term bottom line change, and the answer is no. We'll stay really focused on it. We can stretch tech spend out, we can delay, we can do some stuff at the margin, but the real driver ultimately has to come from quality loan growth, cross-selling fee income and hopefully a move in rates.","And by the way, just to go back to your original assumption, if basically we are going to be in this low rate environment for a long period of time and we come to that conclusion and that's what's being foreshadowed by the Fed, then we'll invest into it, right. I mean at this point we have half the Fed governors telling us they're going in December, or more than half, and half saying no, so if they all said no, you'd probably have a bit of a rally in the backend but we have $34 billion of cash sitting at the Fed at 25 basis point. So there's a lever there that I don't think we should use or need to use but it's available.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed.","William S. Demchak","Operator, I mean do we want to poll again for any other questions that are out there?","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Mr. Wasserstrom, your line is open. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Wasserstrom","My questions have been addressed. Thank you.","William S. Demchak","One last question.","Operator","And we do have a question from Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please proceed.","Nancy Bush","Bill, you've been the only CEO thus far who has said, we are disappointed with the Fed's failure to raise rates. I think you said the same thing as I recall in Boston about three years ago. You've been one of the more forthright I think in not necessarily criticizing but certainly calling it to everyone's attention. We know what it's doing to the banking industry but could you just give us your perspective on what ZIRP is doing to the rest of the economy?","William S. Demchak","Sorry, on what is doing?","Nancy Bush","ZIRP, zero interest rate policy.","William S. Demchak","Okay, that's what I need, a new buzzword. Look away from what's happening inside of bank, I think a couple of things. There is not a single CFO, CEO person that I've met anywhere inside of this country who has suggested they're going to change their investment decisions or purchasing behavior as a function of 25 basis point change in interest rates. I personally believe that the practical impact on the economy of raising rates back to a more normalized level, figure out what that is, is a lot less than what people are assuming it is because I think they were pushing on a string when they dropped rates from the 1% level down to zero.","I think that in effect the destruction of retirement income for retirees, we have trained people their whole lives that once they retire and they are supposed to change their 401(k) and put it into kind of a less risky fixed rate investment portfolio, today they can't do it, they can't live on it. So we are stretching out the need for people to work, we are destroying their ability to retire with the savings they have today and we are basically in the extreme bailing out the younger generation and putting it on the backs of retirees with this interest rate policy and I continue to think it's wrong, I've been critical of it, I'm biased because it hurts the banking industry, but I just think that zero on rates is a different starting point than when rates were at 3% and thinking that they are supposed to tighten from 3%, and for some reason that seems to be lost.","Nancy Bush","So when they do decide to move and let's assume it's 25 basis points which seems to be the consensus, does it make any difference?","William S. Demchak","That's right, I don't think it does, I mean at the margin it helps us. For no other reason they're going to do it through the interest paid on excess reserves and we sit with 35 whatever billion dollars sitting there, but no, I just don't think it has a direct impact on the economy. People come back and they say it's going to move the dollar more than it has and in turn hurt exports. Perhaps, but is that on a 25 basis point move, is it on a 50 basis point move, is it on a 1.5% move, it's just not obvious to me. And I think the fact, I think there was something to this general notion that by choosing not to move rates they were signaling a real lack of confidence in the economy, which is playing out now in the sentiment you are seeing from surveys with consumers and corporations, and confidence matters.","Nancy Bush","All right, thank you.","William S. Demchak","We are approaching the hour, so at this point we're going to conclude our call. We thank all of you for participating in today's call and look forward to talking to you later on.

Callihan","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call our PNC's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Demchak and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Our forward-looking statements regarding PNC's performance assume a continuation of the current economic trends and do not take into account the impact of potential legal and regulatory contingencies. Actual results and future events could differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in our statements and from the historical performance due to a variety of risks and other factors.","Information about such factors, as well as GAAP reconciliations and other information on non-GAAP financial measures we discuss is included in today's conference call, earnings release, and related presentation materials and in our 10-K, 10-Q and various other SEC filings and investor materials.","These are all available on the corporate website, pnc.com, under the Investor Relations section. These statements speak only as of January 16, 2015, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bill Demchak.","William S. Demchak","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everybody. As you've seen today, we reported net income of $4.2 billion or $7.30 per diluted common share for the full year, now, that compares with 2013 net income of $4.2 billion or $7.36 per diluted common share. Our return on average assets for the full year was 1.28%.","2014 was a successful year for PNC, despite what proved to be a pretty challenging revenue environment with low rates and elevated competition. We grew loans 4% and deposits 6%. Fee income was up 4% and represented a higher percentage of our total revenue mix in 2014 than in 2013.","We strengthened our capital position even as we continued to return capital to shareholders through repurchases and higher dividends. We controlled expenses well and like the rest of the industry, benefited from continued outstanding credit quality. And importantly, we've made significant progress against our strategic priorities in 2014.","You know, we're almost 3 years now into the RBC acquisition, and we continue to grow in the southeast faster than in our legacy markets. Brand awareness there is up to about 65% from 50% a year ago.","We're thrilled with the team we have on the ground. And importantly, there are no material incremental investment costs to come in the southeast, really just incremental revenue as we continue to develop relationships, win business, and gain share.","We know it's going to take time for us to build a leading banking franchise in the southeast, but we are exceeding our expectations. We're extremely excited about the potential in the region.","Inside of our Asset Management Group, we continued to grow assets in 2014 or assets under administration, driven by increases in the equity markets, new sales production, and cross sell referrals from other lines of business.","Our transformation of the retail banking experience continues to gain momentum. We are well on our way to completing about 300 branch conversions by the end of the first quarter, which is increasingly important as the number of customers who prefer non-branch channels for their routine banking transactions approaches 50%.","These new, more efficient branches offer more technology and more opportunities for a meaningful sales and service conversation with those customers who do walk through the door, resulting in our best chance to truly understand our customer's needs and build deeper, more profitable relationships with them.","With regard to mortgage, Rob will talk with you in a few minutes about the financial results and there is no denying that it remains a challenging time for this segment of the industry.","Strategically, we've made a lot of progress in cleaning up the mortgage business we acquired as part of the National City deal and increasingly making it a core part of our consumer product offering. We have and will continue to improve the home buying experience for those of our customers who come to us with their mortgage needs.","Lastly, looking at technology, we made a great deal of progress over the last year, particularly with regard to improving our cyber defenses and our data center strategy. We have a lot of ground still to cover as we execute our multi-year technology plan, but we are right where we aim to be in this effort to improve long-term efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability. So we are executing well with regard to the things that we can control.","As I turn back to the fourth-quarter results, you're going to see that revenues were elevated by gains on asset dispositions and expenses were elevated due to a contribution to the PNC Foundation as well as higher legal and compliance costs. While there are a number of elevated items in both revenues and expenses, they all basically net to roughly zero. So you can view our reported pre-tax pre-provision earnings as largely representing our core pretax, pre-prevision earnings.","However, below the line we did have one specific item that drove a lower than normal effective tax rate, and Rob will take you through some more details on this.","One thing you'll notice on our balance sheet is that our security balances remained flat quarter-to-quarter, versus the declines we had posted in the second and third quarter. In fact, during the course of the fourth quarter, we tactically added swaps, securities, and some forward starting positions to the balance sheet.","We remain very asset sensitive; but inside of this core position, you'll occasionally see us tactically move the portfolio composition and related duration, as we did in the fourth quarter.","I like how we are positioned for 2015 and beyond. The coming year looks a lot like 2014 at the moment, which means revenue growth will remain a challenge, particularly until we get a rise in rates.","In addition, while we and the rest of the industry continue to benefit from abnormally low credit costs, this will eventually reverse itself. These two factors, interest rates and credit costs, will play off against each other as we move into 2015 and beyond.","Notwithstanding these headwinds, we are a year further into the execution of our strategic priorities and we continue to make important progress across the board. We enjoy a stronger capital position as we enter 2015. We have a more liquid balance sheet that is now compliant with LCR requirements.","We also have a terrific team of employees across our franchise, committed to delivering a superior banking experience for every customer and focused on creating long-term value for our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at the fourth quarter and full year results, and then we'll take your questions.","Robert Q. Reilly","Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill just mentioned, 2014 was a very good year for PNC. Our net income exceeded $4 billion again this year, as we successfully executed our strategic objectives within what continues to be a challenging revenue environment.","Importantly, the year played out largely as we expected and consistent with our guidance. Our fourth quarter results contributed to those outcomes and reflected themes we saw throughout the year.","Turning to our average balance sheet on slide 4, average total assets increased by $10 billion or 3% on a linked quarter basis. Average total assets increased by $25.6 billion or 8% over the fourth quarter of last year. In both periods, the increase was driven by higher deposits held with the Federal Reserve and higher average loan balances.","Average commercial loans during the fourth quarter were up $3.3 billion or 3% from the third quarter. Average consumer lending declined slightly linked quarter, as growth in credit card and automobile loans was more than offset by the runoff of non-strategic home equity and education loans.","On a spot basis, fourth quarter loan balances increased by $3.9 billion or 2% linked quarter. All of this increase came from commercial lending, which was up $4.3 billion or 3% due to increases in nearly every category.","Compared to the fourth quarter last year, total average loans increased by $8.3 billion or 4%, as total commercial lending grew $10.2 billion or 9%, primarily driven by growth in specialty lending.","These increases were partially offset by declines in consumer and residential mortgage loans, most of which were non-strategic. For the full year, total non-strategic loans declined by more than $1.5 billion.","Average investment securities were flat linked quarter as reinvestment activity offset net payments and maturities. As Bill mentioned, prior to the market rally, we added securities that will settle in the first quarter. Compared to the prior year fourth quarter, investment securities were down $3.1 billion or 5%.","And lastly, our average interest earning deposits with banks, primarily with the Federal Reserve, were $27.7 billion for the fourth quarter, largely related to addressing the requirements of the liquidity coverage rules that went into effect January 1st, 2015. I'll have more to say on that in a moment.","On the liability side, total average deposits increased by $5.6 billion or 2% when compared to the third quarter, driven mostly by higher money market and demand deposits. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, total average deposits increased by $12.4 billion or 6%, as growth in demand, money market, and savings deposits was partially offset by lower retail CDs.","On an average basis, total equity remained stable in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, primarily due to increased stock buybacks. Compared to the fourth quarter last year, total equity increased by $2.9 billion or 7%.","As I mentioned, our balance sheet reflects our efforts to comply with the liquidity coverage standards and support loan growth. For example, our average interest earning deposits with banks, primarily with the Federal Reserve, increased by $5.6 billion or 25% linked quarter, and by $17.2 billion or 165% compared to the same time a year ago.","Further, on the liability side, we increased average total borrowings by $3 billion or 6% linked quarter, and by $9.3 billion or 22% compared to December 31st, 2013.","The Federal Reserve short term liquidity coverage ratio went into effect on January 1st. PNC is an advanced approaches bank, and we are subject to the full LCR approach. Using the month end reporting methodology, the minimum phase-in requirement as of January 1st, 2015, is 80%. As of December 31st, 2014, our estimated pro forma ratio exceeded 95% and 100% for the bank and bank holding company respectively.","Turning to capital, we maintained strong capital levels throughout the year while at the same time delivering significant capital return to our shareholders. During the fourth quarter, we purchased 6.1 million common shares for approximately $500 million. Since the beginning of our current program, which began in the second quarter of 2014, we've purchased 12.9 million common shares for $1.1 billion and are on target to meet our approved total capital plan of $1.5 billion for the four CCAR quarters ending March 31st, 2015.","Our Standardized Approach risk-weighted assets increased by $3.7 billion on a linked quarter basis as a result of higher commercial loan balances.","As of December 31st, 2014, our pro forma Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, fully phased-in and using the standardized approach, was estimated to be 10%, a 10 basis point decrease from the end of the third quarter due essentially to capital return and to a lesser extent, higher risk-weighted assets. For the full year, our estimated ratio has increased by 60 basis points.","Finally, our tangible book value reached $59.88 per common share as of December 31st, a 1% increase linked quarter and a 10% increase compared to a year ago.","Turning to our income statement on slide 6, net income was $1.1 billion or $1.84 per diluted common share, and our return on average assets was 1.23%. Our fourth quarter performance was marked by elevated noninterest income and expenses compared to the third quarter, stable credit quality, and disciplined expense management.","Let me highlight a few items in our income statement. Net interest income declined slightly by $7 million compared to the third quarter, as lower purchase accounting accretion was partially offset by higher core net interest income.","Noninterest income was $1.9 billion, an increase of $113 million or 7% linked quarter. This was higher than expected, driven by $130 million of gains on asset dispositions, including the sale of PNC's Washington, DC, regional headquarters and Visa stock.","Noninterest expense increased by $182 million or 8% compared to the third quarter. Of this increase, $128 million reflected several elevated items, of which the largest was our contribution to the PNC Foundation, as well as higher legal and residential mortgage compliance costs and higher fixed asset write-offs.","Setting those aside, fourth quarter expenses were in line with our expectations and continued to be well managed, due in part to the success of our continuous improvement program. Importantly, we expect expenses in the first quarter of 2015 to decline and likely approximate the levels in the third quarter of 2014.","As a result of the tax favorability of our contribution to the PNC Foundation and to a lesser extent some tax credits, our effective tax rate was 22.1% in the fourth quarter, down from 27.4% in the third quarter. For the full year, our effective tax rate was 25.1%, which was in line with our guidance. We expect our 2015 effective tax rate to be between 25% and 26%.","Finally, provision in the fourth quarter declined to $52 million, as overall credit quality remained stable. For the full year, net income was $4.2 billion or $7.30 per diluted common share and our return on average assets was 1.28%.","Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to net interest income on slide 7, total net interest income decreased by $7 million for the reasons I just highlighted. Average interest earning assets grew by $9 billion or 3% linked quarter, and the full year increase was $22.7 billion or 9%.","As I mentioned, purchase accounting accretion of $126 million declined by $21 million linked quarter. Core net interest income increased by $14 million, due to higher commercial loan growth and securities yields.","For the full year 2014, purchase accounting accretion was down $260 million compared to 2013, in line with our expectations. For 2015, we continue to expect purchase accounting to be down approximately $225 million compared to 2014.","Net interest margin declined 9 basis points linked quarter, of that amount, 3 basis points was attributable to purchase accounting and the remaining 6 basis points was due to liquidity related actions. Spread compression was entirely offset by volume increases in commercial lending.","In terms of our interest rate sensitivity, our duration of equity has naturally increased as rates declined, but we did take some tactical actions in the fourth quarter. Specifically, we purchased agency residential mortgage-backed securities that will settle in the first quarter. As you know, our balance sheet remains asset sensitive, reflecting our view of the interest rate environment. And as we have said for some time, we recognize this will likely constrain our NII growth in the short term.","Turning to noninterest income on slide 8, our diverse businesses drove relatively stable fee income this quarter. As you recall, we expected this due to elevated third quarter levels. Full-year fee income grew by $189 million or 4% as increases in corporate services and asset management fees, along with service charges on deposits were partially offset by lower residential mortgage income. Excluding residential mortgage, fee income increased by $442 million or 10%.","Total noninterest income increased by $113 million or 7% linked quarter and was essentially flat compared to 2013. Notably, the increase in the core fee component of noninterest income reflects our success in growing higher quality, more sustainable revenue streams in 2014.","Asset management fees declined $35 million or 9% on a linked quarter basis, entirely due to lower earnings from PNC's equity investment in BlackRock, as described in their call yesterday. PNC's Asset Management business performed well in the fourth quarter, in line with third quarter results.","For the full year, asset management fees were up $171 million or 13% compared to 2013, reflecting stronger equity markets and sales production. Consumer services fees were essentially unchanged in the fourth quarter and for the year. On a business level, we saw mid to high single digit growth for brokerage, debit card, credit card, and merchant services.","However, these gains were offset by lower revenue from previously discontinued insurance programs, as well as the termination of our debit cards rewards program in the fourth quarter of 2013, which resulted in a prior year benefit and consequently diluted the year-over-year growth comparison.","Corporate services fees grew $23 million or 6%, reflecting higher merger and acquisition advisory fees and other capital markets revenue. For the full year, corporate services fees increased $205 million or 17%.","Although this category benefited from the impact of a fee reclassification starting in the second quarter of 2014, as well as our recent acquisition of Solebury Capital Group, the primary driver was higher merger and acquisition advisory fees as Harris Williams, our M&A advisory services firm had a record year.","Residential mortgage banking noninterest income declined by $5 million linked quarter or 4%. Fourth quarter origination volume was $2.4 billion, down 5% from the third quarter.","For the full year, residential mortgage banking noninterest income declined by $253 million or 29%, reflecting lower loan sales activity and significantly lower MSR gains.","Service charges on deposits were relatively flat linked quarter, but for the full year they increased by $65 million or 11% compared to 2013. The year-over-year comparison benefited primarily from changes in product offerings and higher customer related activity.","Other categories of noninterest income increased by $128 million linked quarter, which was primarily attributable to the sale of our regional headquarters building in Washington, DC.","Given that we occupy only a couple of floors in that building, which we will continue to occupy on a leased basis, and taking into consideration the real estate prices in that market, the sale of this building made sense to capture a significant gain for our shareholders. For the full year, noninterest income to total revenue was 45%, up 2 percentage points compared to the prior year.","Turning to expenses on slide 9, fourth quarter levels increased by $182 million or 8%. There were 3 items that elevated expenses by $128 million in the quarter. First, the primary driver was the contribution we made to the PNC Foundation, which accounted for the majority of the increase.","Second, higher legal and residential mortgage compliance costs, and third, higher fixed asset write-offs. Excluding these items, our fourth quarter expenses were in line with the guidance we provided.","These results reflect our disciplined expense management and the benefits from our continuous improvement program. We completed actions and exceeded our full 2014 goal of $500 million in cost savings.","As a result, full year expenses declined by $193 million or 2% and in effect, more than funded investments in our retail transformation and technology infrastructure, as intended. This marks the second straight year we reduced total costs while supporting significant investments in our business.","Looking forward to 2015, we will continue this approach and have targeted an additional $400 million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program, which again we expect to help fund our business and technology investments.","As you can see on slide 10, overall credit quality remained relatively stable in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, and improved over the comparable quarter of last year.","A current area of focus is our exposure in the oil and gas sector. We have a total of $2.9 billion in outstandings, which equates to approximately 2% of our total commercial lending portfolio.","The oil and gas book includes approximately $800 million in traditional exploration and production deals, which are secured and covered by margin requirements, and an additional approximate $800 million in the midstream and downstream space. The balance of the outstandings, which is approximately $1.3 billion is in the services space and the majority of that or approximately $1 billion, is asset based.","So the remaining amount of about $300 million is not asset-based lending and is non-investment-grade. In our view, these are the loans most likely to be impacted by the drop in oil prices and we are watching that closely. But when put into the context of our broader lending portfolio, our exposure is relatively minimal.","Turning to slide 10 and across the broader credit portfolio, nonperforming loans were down $102 million or 4% compared to the third quarter. And for the full year, nonperforming loans were down $578 million or 19%. In both periods, we saw improvements across our commercial and consumer portfolios.","Total past-due loans decreased by $60 million or 3% linked quarter. We did see some small increases in the 30 and 60 day categories, but view these as more deal specific than any change in trends.","Net charge-offs of $118 million increased by $36 million or 44% linked quarter, primarily due to higher recoveries in the third quarter. As a result, net charge-offs were 23 basis points of average loans on an annualized basis, up 7 basis points linked quarter. Our provision of $52 million declined by $3 million or 5% on a linked quarter basis.","And, finally, the allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans is 1.63% as of December 31st. This compares to 1.84% at the same time a year ago. While we were pleased with this performance and as we've acknowledged for some time, we continue to believe credit trends may not remain at these levels.","In summary, PNC posted successful fourth quarter and full year 2014 results. Turning to 2015, we believe the domestic economy will continue to expand at a steady pace. This is our basis for expecting higher interest rates during the course of 2015. However, we recognize the global macro factors are likely to persist and could prevail in delaying and or diminishing otherwise anticipated rate increases.","With that in mind, we expect full year revenue in 2015 will continue to be under pressure compared with 2014, as we expect the combined revenue growth from our businesses to partially offset the decline in purchase accounting accretion.","Operating in this challenging revenue environment, disciplined expense management will continue to be a priority. We expect full year expenses to be stable compared to 2014, as we intend to fund the investments we're making in our businesses primarily through expense savings.","Looking ahead at the first quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, we expect modest loan growth. We expect net interest income to remain stable. We expect fee income to be down mid single digits due to seasonality and typical first quarter client activity. We expect expenses to be down high single digits, more in line with third quarter 2014 levels. And we expect provision to be between $50 million and $100 million.","And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.","William H. Callihan","Operator, if you could give our participants the instructions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Wonderful. Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question on the line comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Jessica Ribner","Good morning, guys. It's Jessica Ribner in for Paul. How are you?","William H. Callihan","Good morning, Jessica.","Robert Q. Reilly","Good morning, Jessica.","Jessica Ribner","One question on your mortgage bank. I know you guys have been focusing there and given where rates are now in the 30 year down to 3.66%, what are you seeing in the first quarter? Can you give us some color?","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes.","Jessica Ribner","And then, how do you think the purchase market is shaping up actually? Because we know refis right, are going to be a little bit stronger?","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes, hi, Jessica. Good morning; it's Rob. To answer your question, in the first couple weeks here of the year, given the rate movement that you reference, we've seen a significant jump in applications, particularly on the refi side, which are up almost 170% versus this time last year. Purchases is about the same; but the real driver is on the refi because of the rates that you mentioned.","Jessica Ribner","Okay. Great. Then in terms of expenses, you're targeting that $400 million of cost saves, but you expect to reinvest that. I just want to be clear.","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes, absolutely clear. That's what we've done for the last couple of years, and that program has worked for us and we're committed to continuing that program in 2015.","Jessica Ribner","So based on that, can you give us an idea of where you think your efficiency ratio could settle out?","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes, we don't have a specific efficiency ratio target, because the biggest driver of that is really outside of our control; and that's interest rates. What we do is manage our expenses, as I've mentioned in this challenging revenue environment with a high degree of discipline. And we are committed to keeping those stable as we make continued investments in mostly our technology and retail bank transformation.","Jessica Ribner","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","William H. Callihan","You're welcome. Next question please.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","John McDonald","Morning, guys.","William H. Callihan","Hey, John.","Robert Q. Reilly","Good morning.","John McDonald","Was wondering if you could talk about the fee income drivers that you are looking for in 2015. Feels like it's going to be a tough year on NII and as Bill mentioned, provision gets a little tougher. So fee income seems to be an important driver to help revenues this year. What are some of the drivers you're looking for this year?","Robert Q. Reilly","Well, I \u2013 you're absolutely right, and a lot of our strategies are around driving the fee income. We've had a lot of success with that in 2014 in terms of the growth that you've seen.","If you just take a look at the broad categories, asset management, we continue to experience high single digit growth and have those types of expectations. Consumer services, we're seeing mid to high single digit growth in the products that I mentioned.","The year-over-year comparison had some unfortunate year-over-year comparisons, because of the diluted effect of some of the contra-revenue items, but we continue to see growth there.","Corporate services, we say mid single growth. I caveat that, though, just with the biggest driver in 2014 was Harris Williams, our M&A advisory piece, which had a record year, easily twice the level of what they had had the previous year, which I think was a record year, Bill, or close to a record year.","William S. Demchak","Yes.","Robert Q. Reilly","So that could ease off a bit. Mortgage, we'll see. Our view is that we'll see some flattening there. And the rest, in terms of some of the other noninterest incomes are not core fee and those tend to happen.","John McDonald","Okay. So the drivers of the outlook for revenues to be down is really on the purchase accounting side, it sounds like, Rob?","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes, I think that's right.","John McDonald","Okay. Just on loan growth, the C&I loan growth was a nice number for the quarter. Any green shoots of better line utilization there or is other drivers to highlight? And can you just comment a little bit about spreads in C&I, and whether that got any better?","William S. Demchak","Yes, it's Bill. You remember in the third quarter, we kind of had a bit of a hiccup in our trend line of loan growth and we thought it was an anomaly, and it turned out to be the case. So we saw growth into the fourth quarter, again, basically in our specialty businesses, coming off of asset base, some of our public finance healthcare leasing, and so forth.","No real growth in the core middle market commercial space. In fact commercial, which is our lower $50 million and under sales businesses, basically declined quarter-to-quarter with some of the runoff from the acquisitions.","Just on spreads, you're seeing, the highest areas in asset-based lending, where with fees we're still probably over 300 basis points. Core middle market, new originations around 200. Corporate finance, the higher-cap guys maybe 175 or so. We continue to kind of see the 3, 4, 5 basis point down quarter-to-quarter in average loan yields and that doesn't seem to be abating.","John McDonald","Okay. And then finally, any thoughts on how the energy pullback might affect C&I demand more broadly, Bill? And just kind of a review of where your exposure lies on the energy side and some of the puts and takes you see there?","William S. Demchak","Yes, I mean, Rob went through some of the detail in his comments on the energy portfolio. Just to drill down on that real quickly, some of its reserve based. It's smaller, it's new for us. It's secured and hedged. So we're not sweating that yet.","The stuff we have on the servicing side, the bulk of it is inside of our asset-based lending group. And while there could be difficulties there, our ability to \u2013 because we are collateralized and work through that, we wouldn't expect material losses.","It really focuses in on our unsecured servicing book, much of which is actually done in small business in commercial and small balance. And if we're going to have problems, it's probably there and it's $300 million of funded loans. So I don't sweat that too much.","I think as you go through the rest of our footprint and market, we don't really operate in the places that \u2013 with the exception of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and I'll talk about that in a second, we don't really operate in the places that have kind of boomed as a function of energy.","And even here, gas and investment in gas seems to be taking a bit of a different tack than what we've seen in oil. So we don't see it really manifesting itself locally in any material form.","I think you're going to see just in the broader economy, right, that consumer is empowered here. You see consumer spending up, you're going to see retailers do better. So a little bit of a mix shift. But we continue to be pretty constructive on the benefit to the US economy as a function of lower gas prices and lower oil prices.","John McDonald","Okay. Great. Thanks.","William H. Callihan","Next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Scott Siefers","Morning, guys.","William S. Demchak","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Siefers","Maybe Bill or Rob, I was hoping you might be able to spend a quick second just on \u2013 so has there been any sort of lasting change in the way you are approaching the securities portfolio? Bill, you've been probably more unequivocal than most about sort of investing and the risks of doing so, given the curve.","William S. Demchak","Yes.","Scott Siefers","You got a little more, it seems like opportunistic this quarter. But just want to make sure the philosophy still holds true, see if there is any change to the way you're approaching things?","William S. Demchak","Yes, we remain committed to the core asset sensitivity that we hold. In the fourth quarter, it became pretty apparent that the yield differential between the US and Europe and the strength of the dollar was such that we probably had to take a few chips off the table and we did.","Our conviction on rates here as you just look forward, as Rob said, the US economy still feels pretty strong. My own expectation and there is some debate here, is that we'll still see the Fed do something in 2015. At issue is how much they would do, again given the strength of the dollar and low CPI and more importantly whether, even if they raise short-term rates, there is any impact on long-term rates.","Having said all of that, I always go back to my core theme, which, you know, the opportunity cost of remaining short just doesn't \u2013 just is not that high and it doesn't affect our strategic priorities and our ability to execute on the business we pursue.","Robert Q. Reilly","So no major change in philosophy.","William S. Demchak","No major change, although I would tell you I wish I was a bit more tactical than I was in the fourth quarter.","Scott Siefers","Okay. That's perfect and I appreciate that. And then wanted to come back, Bill, to a comment. I know this is pretty small in the scheme of your overall footprint. But in places like Pennsylvania and Ohio where you've got the shale activity, can you spend a little more time just discussing kind of how the investments there have been different?","I guess my impression has been it's been \u2013 kind of we're still more in our infancy there than in other parts of the country. But by the same token, I would imagine that CapEx cut at larger energy companies would have broad based implications even in kind of the natural gas space. So what are your thoughts around that issue?","William S. Demchak","Yes, you know, I saw some stats that I think 1% of the \u2013 it was a tiny number of the employment growth inside of the Pittsburgh region came from energy, which actually surprised me. I would have thought it had been more.","Just on the CapEx side, you're right. For the large guys you would \u2013 in effect, capital expenditure is substitutable. But what we are seeing is the cuts into oil are deeper than what's happening in gas. And so there hasn't been any kind of immediate impact.","You also have the issue just with gas, you'll remember as part of energy policy, the switch of the utilities to gas long-term out of coal, causes this need to continue, independent of what's going on with raw oil prices.","Scott Siefers","Okay. All right. That's perfect. I appreciate all the color on that.","William H. Callihan","Next question please.","Operator","Our next comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Steven Duong","Hi, everyone. This is actually Steven Duong in for Gerard. Thanks for taking our call. So, just looking at 2015, what do you guys see as the biggest challenge for the year that's coming up?","William S. Demchak","I mean, beyond \u2013 and there's nothing we can do about it, interest rates are obviously the biggest drivers that ultimately are bottom line in 2015. Challenges are somewhat related to that. We continue to execute on what we set out there, but I would tell you competition continues to get tougher. The willingness of competitors to stretch on risk and yield, particularly as we see NIM pressures because of rates, I think is probably going to accelerate.","And for us it's basically staying inside of our credit box, continuing to win new customers and cross-sell in an environment where we'll progressively see more irrational competition.","Steven Duong","Great. Thank you. And just following up on interest rates then, have you guys looked into scenarios of flattening or inverted yield curve? Like, how would that impact 2015?","William S. Demchak","We've looked into every iteration of the yield curve. I think, the impact into 2015, while obviously being negative, would be less dramatic than what that would cause longer-term, obviously.","We do think in its most basic form right, NII will benefit from short rates going up, simply because of the repricing of loans and the degree of stickiness in our deposits. You lose the ability of carry on your securities books. So the upside isn't as much as it would be if we just see the front end increase.","My own expectation, I don't, look, I don't think even if the Fed goes that they are going to go to a point where they cause an inversion here. But you could definitely see a flattening of the curve and I would expect you would see one.","Steven Duong","Great. Thank you. And just last question, just regarding your tax rate getting back to the 25%, 26% range. Is that mainly due to the charitable foundation that you guys did this quarter?","Robert Q. Reilly","The reason that our tax rate was lower than that, at the 22% or so was primarily because of the foundation and as I mentioned, some tax credits. So the guidance between 25% and 26% is the go forward.","Steven Duong","Okay, great. Well, thank you for taking our questions.","William H. Callihan","Next question please.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Yes, good morning.","Robert Q. Reilly","Good morning.","William S. Demchak","Good morning.","Erika Najarian","Morning. My first question, Rob, on the full year revenue outlook for 2015, I just want to be clear that it doesn't contemplate shifts in either end of the curve, either increases in the short end or any significant change on the long end?","Robert Q. Reilly","No, I would say in terms of our 2015 outlook, as Bill mentioned, we do have built in some rise in rates in the second half of the year. So that is part of our thinking.","William S. Demchak","Yes, but in effect what we do inside of the budgeting process and the guidance we give is we do it off of forward rates. I would tell you that since we put that in place we've seen forwards decline.","So it's one of the reasons that Rob is a little soft on kind of suggesting that there is going to be revenue pressure in 2015.","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes.","Erika Najarian","Understood. And now that the CCAR documents have been submitted to the extent that you could share with us, do you think there is any more flexibility from the Fed for well capitalized regional banks such as yourselves to have a little bit more control over your capital return outside the regular dividend? Either in terms of a special or higher payouts through buybacks, higher than what we've seen so far from regional banks?","Robert Q. Reilly","I can answer a little bit; and then, Bill, you can jump in. I would say we have submitted our plan. There is not a lot to say about that. When we get the results we'll share them with you, of course. There won't be a special dividend. I think everybody knows that. So that's not in the cards for 2015. So, Bill?","William S. Demchak","I think, look, absent the recent submission, it is very clear and I \u2013 my own belief is that the Fed understands this, that eventually banks are going to have to get to the place where they can return 100% of the capital they generate once they hit acceptable total capital levels. And I think the regulators get that, right. They don't have a desire to have us drive our capital ratios to infinity.","The notion of doing a special dividend or something is a conversation at this point and an interest, but nothing that is inside of guidance. It can be done as part of CCAR.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you.","Robert Q. Reilly","Okay.","William H. Callihan","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Robert Placet","Hi, good morning. This is Rob Placet from Matt's team. First question, I was just curious if you could talk to the puts and takes included in your outlook for flat net interest income in 1Q, just given pressure from purchase accounting accretion, likely some pressure from day count, and the boost you received from higher securities yields this quarter?","Robert Q. Reilly","I think you just covered it. Yes, those are the elements. We are calling for modest loan growth. As we mentioned, some change in our securities portfolio that will settle in the first quarter. So that's \u2013 those are the pluses working against some of the minuses that you mentioned.","Robert Placet","Right, okay. Thanks. And then just a clarification question. Your comment for flat expenses in 2015, is that on a core basis or reported?","Robert Q. Reilly","Well, it's stable and it's on a reported basis.","Robert Placet","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Robert Q. Reilly","Sure.","William H. Callihan","Next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Morning, guys. Hey, just to take the guidance point one point further, since you've gotten a couple of questions on it, all of the guidance is off a reported basis, is that correct?","William S. Demchak","That's correct.","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes.","Ken Usdin","Right, okay. So Rob, just underneath the NII side, PA going to be down again this year. So it would imply also that it's just going to be tough to grow core NII enough to balance that off on the NII side, even with the probably better than expected starting point for the first half of the \u2013 for the first part of the year?","Robert Q. Reilly","I think I caught most of that. Its \u2013 I'm not sure about our line, there's a line issue there. But I think the question was, yes, that's right. The purchase accounting guidance which will be down $225 million is our estimate there, will make it tough to grow total NII above that.","Ken Usdin","And do you \u2013 but do you expect to be able to have enough core balance sheet growth to offset the core NIM pressure to be able to deliver core NII growth? Sorry, that was the essence of the question. Can you grow core NII this year?","Robert Q. Reilly","Well, I think the \u2013 I think we're close. I think it largely going to depend on what's outside of our control in terms of rates. But naturally what's \u2013 what we can do, it will depend on the loan growth in the securities book that we have. But it's close.","Ken Usdin","Understood. And then should we just assume that your ability and willingness to take additional Visa gains will be opportunistic throughout the year, but nothing that we can necessarily depend on as far as guidance?","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes, that's right, that's exactly right. And we don't include that in our guidance.","Ken Usdin","Right, okay. Thanks, guys.","Robert Q. Reilly","Sure.","William H. Callihan","Okay. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Good morning. Bill, it looked for a time like you guys were focused on slowing your commercial loan growth while the rest of the industry continued to step on the gas somewhat.","And you seem to be going somewhat against the broader trends based on what I think you guys were highlighting as some frothiness that you saw in certain areas.","But this quarter, as you talked about earlier, we saw you guys once again accelerate commercial loan growth. And that seems a little bit more consistent with the strong industry growth that we're seeing in the H8 data. ","So I guess my guess is that pricing hasn't necessarily gotten more attractive given where we are in the cycle. But I was hoping that you could share some perspective on what's happening and in particular whether there's anything that you'd call out as fueling your appetite to grow more aggressively in commercial now, relative to the deceleration?","William S. Demchak","Well, let me \u2013 yes, sure. Let me just clarify. We like commercial loan growth. So we never suggested we wanted to slow it. We did see a slowing in the third quarter. At issue for us is finding returns on clients that basically pay for the capital committed. So as spreads come in, we need more cross-sell for it to make sense.","So we haven't changed our risk return bucket at all. We found opportunities in the fourth quarter with new clients and existing clients, it just grew balances. But it wasn't because we changed our appetite on risk or our willingness to do sub economic returns. We just did better than we did in the third quarter.","Again, where we're seeing core growth is probably a little bit atypical than some of our competitors. It's not in the traditional plain vanilla commercial middle market space, it's in our specialty businesses.","So in asset based lending and real estate leasing, some of the public finance specialties, and asset securitization and some other things. So we're seeing growth in places where, frankly, there is just less competition and we are taking advantage of that.","Bill Carcache","I see. That's really helpful. Separately, some banks have commented on the punitive nature of municipal deposits, while this quarter we've also heard others talk about how they view their municipal deposits as a positive, particularly in light of the most recent LCR revisions.","Can you update us on how PNC is thinking about municipal deposits and whether you see any potential revenue opportunity there?","William S. Demchak","Yes, sure. So we do \u2013 we have a big business with municipalities on the issuance side, deposit side, treasury management side and other things. At issue with the LCR as it related to muni deposits and in the first proposal, to the extent that you had to pledge securities, in particular, Level 1 securities against the deposit balances, you both lost the ability to count those securities as part of your Level 1 securities and you also had to treat the deposits as if they were repo or in effect immediate runoff.","The revisions to LCR cause you to still lose the ability to count the securities in your base, but they dramatically shifted the runoff in deposits. So the runoff is now 15% or something versus the 100% immediate it was before. So it's gotten better. It's still not without pain.","Having said that, our relationship with municipalities go beyond what we do in deposits. And so like all our clients, we look across the broad based relationship and to the extent that the collective business makes sense to us, we do it.","Bill Carcache","That is extremely helpful. Thanks, Bill. If I may, one last one on asset quality for Rob. Your net charge-off rate ticked higher this quarter for the first time in quite a while. And I think \u2013 was the last quarter the trough, would you say and we're likely to kind of continue to move gradually higher from these levels at a similar pace to roughly the 7 basis point increase that we saw this quarter?","William S. Demchak","Well, I've said that for seven quarters running\u2026","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes, it's all consistent. I mean, the last quarter the charge-off ratio was 16 basis points. So if that's not the trough, that's getting down to about as low as you can go. So at 23 basis points we still think on a normalized sort of look that's on the low end.","But I'd say charge-offs and recoveries have sort of been fairly steady, and in the short term we don't see dramatic changes to that. But over time we do see those levels going back to more normal levels, as Bill mentioned in his opening comments.","Bill Carcache","So the reserve \u2013 any kind of reserve building going forward or would you say it is more a function of growth \u2013 being driven by growth than any kind of\u2026","Robert Q. Reilly","Well, growth will obviously add to reserves. What I've said before and said this morning as far as releases, we did have a release here in the fourth quarter, and we would expect everything else staying the same by going forward that we may have further releases, although not necessarily at these levels.","Bill Carcache","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Robert Q. Reilly","Sure.","William H. Callihan","Okay. Next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Nancy Bush","Good morning, gentlemen.","Robert Q. Reilly","Good morning.","Nancy Bush","Bill, you started off your commentary with talking about growth in the southeast, et cetera. Could you just add some color to that, and so that the percentage of revenues that you're driving from the southeast right now, and whether you see opportunities for acquisitions here?","William S. Demchak","Well, I'll get the last question first, which is \u2013 as we've stated many times, we're not in the market for acquisitions at this point, a bunch of different reasons, from price through to wanting to complete our technology initiatives.","The growth in the southeast, generic. It's coming across all the businesses. As I said, it's at a \u2013 we're growing at a faster pace than we're growing our legacy franchise. I think at this point it's kind of 11% of our total revenue, so it's starting to matter.","We did a lot of things right down there. We \u2013 from the brand equity we got from the branch acquisition, we added really good people both from legacy markets we sent down as well as people who were attracted to our brand and wanted to work with us.","We've gathered great clients. We focused on getting the right clients and had the patience to spend the time to get the right clients and it's just working. I mean, in addition, look, the southeast continues to be a pretty hot part of the economy and we've seen it rebound back probably better than we had expected when we did the deal.","Nancy Bush","Well, I'm speaking to you from Atlanta, so I can pretty much say that that is the case.","William S. Demchak","You see all the cranes there. I think as an aside, I'm reasonably sure this is accurate. Our Atlanta market had what was one of our largest markets for corporate banking fees this year.","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes, that's right.","Nancy Bush","Yes. Secondly, there was an article in the financial press a couple of days ago about the reemergence of the CMBS business. And you guys have been material in that business for a long period of time. I just wanted to check in and get your observations?","William S. Demchak","I'm a little bit distanced from it. We're material in it in the sense that we have the probably largest or second largest bank owned servicing operations\u2026","Nancy Bush","Right.","William S. Demchak","In the form of Midland that we've grown servicing year-on-year inside of that business. What we have seen, we had balance sheet growth through term loan lending in real estate, largely in competition with life companies over the last couple years and that is starting to slow down given the reemergence of the CMBS market.","We play at the margin in origination of CMBS loans that will be contributed to somebody else's deals. But it's just small amount \u2013 a small amount and not material to us.","Nancy Bush","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","William S. Demchak","Yes.","William H. Callihan","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby","Thank you. I wanted to ask you about another strategy you-all been talking about with asset management and corporate services, two big growers in fee income. The momentum that you've seen with focusing on that, is there some recollection of business that left the banking system prior to the financial crisis that are coming back, that\u2019s helping that along, as you've seen over the last couple years?","William S. Demchak","I mean two different themes. Just on the corporate services side, we acquired companies, first in National City and then in RBC, who basically didn't have the products and services and the cross sell ratios that PNC had. So we have had the opportunity to cross sell more products into existing clients.","Importantly, through the downturn, we added clients in the corporate book, key clients at a 10% compounded pace for 3 or 4 years. So what we're doing now and you're seeing it show up in the corporate services line, is cross selling to these new clients that we basically got through extending credit.","So that's driving the corporate service line, in addition to the success of Harris Williams. It's a record M&A year kind of across the industry, and Harris Williams took advantage of it.","The asset management growth has been a key focus for the better part of 4 or 5 years now where, I don't know; Rob, you know the numbers, but we've more than doubled the sales force who's out talking to clients and our differential advantage largely comes through our ability to cross sell and refer existing clients in the business \u2013 or existing clients in the bank into that business.","We have good products and services, but what we do better than most is get those in fact in front of clients who already trust us through other relationships.","Robert Q. Reilly","Both consumer and institutional clients.","William S. Demchak","Yes.","Marty Mosby","And what I was kind of referring to is, with a little bit of a squeeze at the upper end in the really large banks, capital wise, regulatory wise, with some of the absence of other competitors, with the weakness of the financial markets, it seems like the super regional banks have all been showing some really nice progress here. And I'm just wondering if you all's piece of the pie hadn't been getting bigger over the last couple years?","William S. Demchak","At the margin, probably, but our business model hasn't changed. We talk about being a Main Street bank, we make loans, take deposits, help people with payments and do retirement. That's what we've been doing for a number of years.","At the margin you see things, the European banks who have shrunk their balance sheets, that led to opportunities inside of real estate lending for example. We clearly have gained share in asset based lending as others have exited. So I couldn't point to a line item and say that X percent of our growth came from somebody else shrinking. But I'm sure it's somewhere embedded in our numbers.","Robert Q. Reilly","And in asset management, as you know, it's a highly fragmented industry. So market share leaders are in the single digit percent kind of numbers.","Marty Mosby","Perfect. Thanks.","Robert Q. Reilly","Okay.","William H. Callihan","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Hilder with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","David Hilder","Thanks. Good morning. I guess I'd like to ask the capital return question in a slightly different way. It looks like your \u2013 you distributed about 50% of net income to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in 2014. And please correct my math if that's not a good round number.","Is that something you'd like to see increase as a percentage in 2015? Do you have any particular goals or targets or ranges?","William S. Demchak","Just correct your number for a second. The issue \u2013 the comparative math in 2014 was largely we didn't get back into the market until the second quarter. So you've kind of have to annualize the back three to get to the right number.","Having said that, it is well below 100% and a couple basic reasons for that. One was that's what we asked for. But two is the capital \u2013 or the return that you ask for is off of your CCAR base case. And in our case when we submit our base case CCAR run it tends to be lower for a variety of reasons, than what we actually produce. So we'll ask for a higher percentage than what it looks like when we actually earn our money.","What we've said all along here is we are biased towards greater capital returns rather than less and I would hope you'd see that in what we're able to do. But until we hear from \u2013 we've submitted our request and our CCAR runs and we await to hear the Fed's views on these.","David Hilder","Okay. Thanks very much. That's helpful.","William H. Callihan","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Compass Point. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Kevin Barker","Congrats on achieving your record price per square foot in the Washington, DC, area.","Robert Q. Reilly","Thank you.","Kevin Barker","You added\u2026","William S. Demchak","We gave credit to Jim Rohr for that.","Kevin Barker","I think it was the first time in Washington, DC, they had a price over $1,000 per square foot.","William S. Demchak","That's right.","Kevin Barker","I notice you added a lot of swaps and hedges to reduce your asset sensitivity, given what's happened with rates recently. How much of that balance sheet reorganization is eating into the $200 million of potential NII that's lost by not fully deploying your excess liquidity?","William S. Demchak","Boy, that\u2019s a bit \u2013 there is a bunch of embedded questions in there and one I can't answer with exact science. In effect, though, one of the things that happened to us through the second and third quarter, first, you saw our security balances decline, so we were net getting shorter.","In addition, we were growing deposits. If you looked at our deposit lines quarter-by-quarter through the year, you'll see a big acceleration in the third and fourth quarter.","So a lot of what we did in the fourth quarter was simply reverse some of the shortening we had in the second and third and then put to work the value of the deposits that we created. So net-net-net I'm not sure, all else equal, that we changed a whole lot our sensitivity to forward NII as a function of rising rates.","Kevin Barker","Okay. And then could you break out the size of the contribution to the PNC Foundation, and the difference between the legal and residential mortgage compliance costs?","Robert Q. Reilly","No, we haven't disclosed those specifics. But the bulk of that $128 million, $130 million was the foundation.","Kevin Barker","Okay. Then the mortgage compliance costs, are those something you expect to recur going forward, given your making investments around the mortgage business? Or is that something that you see as just a one-time charge?","William S. Demchak","We'd like it to be the latter, but in this environment it's tough to say that you don't expect any further legal costs. I would remind you that everything we know about our outstanding litigation is disclosed inside of our Qs and will be again at the end of the year.","Robert Q. Reilly","10-K.","Kevin Barker","I totally understand. And then considering the outsized amount of refinances that you do compared to the industry and your elevated gain on sale margins compared to peers. Do you have an outsized amount of HARP and FHA streamlined refinances in your mortgage production business?","Robert Q. Reilly","No. No, we don't. The gain on sale margin, why it's higher, it's higher for two reasons. One is we tend to be higher than the industry because we don't work through the brokerage channels.","But the bigger delta as it's been in past quarters, is we've had some fair value marks, which expand that spread. But they are relatively small numbers. So the fair value marks in total were $24 million.","Kevin Barker","And do you expect it to go back to the 300 basis points like you said\u2026","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes. Yes. Yes, we do.","Kevin Barker","Okay. All right. Thank you for taking my questions.","William H. Callihan","Sure. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio with KBW. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Christopher Mutascio","Good morning, all. Thanks for taking my questions.","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes.","Christopher Mutascio","Bill, my first question is to you. Can you give me your macro views onto why you're seeing a bit of a bifurcation in the fact that your, kind of your specialty commercial borrowers are \u2013 there is some demand there, but your traditional commercial borrowers you are seeing less demand?","Is it purely competition in those two different spaces? Or there is balance sheet issues between those two borrowers? You're seeing kind of a bifurcation in the demand in those two different segments.","William S. Demchak","It's a good question. I think in its most basic form, I think our specialty businesses just have less competition. So we are gathering greater share of what the opportunities are in that market. Inside of each one of them there is a different story.","So inside of asset based lending, we've seen a lot of the middle market private equity shops start to rely on asset based as their core financing product and not go back to cash flow, because they find that it's easier to work with the lenders in the event of a crisis. They figured that out through the last recession.","I think in real estate it was \u2013 real estate came back, and the European banks exited, and there was just big opportunity and we have a great business there. So it's case-by-case. But in summary, I just think there's \u2013 lending is not a commodity when it's inside of one of these segments versus a straight commercial loan where there's 6,900 banks in the country who want to do it.","Christopher Mutascio","Fair enough. Rob, just a real quick question. You'd mentioned I think some forward securities purchases that will settle in first quarter. Can you provide the dollar amount of what those securities will be?","Robert Q. Reilly","No, no, no. We haven't disclosed that.","Christopher Mutascio","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Robert Q. Reilly","Sure.","William H. Callihan","Okay. Next question please.","Operator","And our last question on the telephone lines comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","Good morning, guys.","Robert Q. Reilly","Hey, John.","William S. Demchak","Morning.","John Pancari","Wanted to see if you could give the expected NII benefit in 2015 from the swaps. If you could give us a little bit of color there. I appreciate the fourth quarter color you gave, but I wanted to see if we can get the full year expectation.","William S. Demchak","No.","William H. Callihan","That would be an awful lot of detail in terms of our guidance, John. I think we've given you a general trend, but I think that would be parsing it down too much in terms of our guidance right now.","John Pancari","Right. No, I get it. I'm just kind of\u2026","William S. Demchak","It's embedded. At the end of the day it doesn't matter where it's coming from, but it's embedded in Rob's forward guidance on what we talked about on core NII.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. Fair enough. And then on energy, we did have a couple of the other energy lenders indicate that the demand for energy lending they could certainly see a spike initially, as you could have the capital markets seize up to a degree, and accordingly you get draws on lines at first and then a pullback in demand later on.","Is that consistent with what you would expect at PNC? And how would you view that initial draw volume differently from a credit perspective?","William S. Demchak","We didn't see, just third quarter, the fourth quarter, we saw marginal increases in line utilization, nothing dramatic, as projects funded out. We saw some balance growth inside of our asset based business, which is kind of great. As people turn to asset based as the way to raise financing. It's secured and we're happy with it. But we haven't seen people draw lines in the event of panic, which it sounds like\u2026","Robert Q. Reilly","Dislocation.","William S. Demchak","Yes, yes.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. And then my last question is \u2013 and you might have addressed this to a degree with Bill Carcache's question. But in terms of the bottoming of the loan loss reserve, relative to loans, just want to get an idea of where you think you could level out there.","Robert Q. Reilly","I think we're in the range. Like I said, we could have some small releases going forward, but generally speaking, our allowance and our provision is in the right range.","William S. Demchak","The big issue with that, I mean everybody tries to figure out if reserve releases can drive 2015. The longer term issue, the longer term value issue, is that the industry and we are running materially below what ought to be through the cycle charge-offs.","Now, maybe we're in this utopian period of great loans for a few years. But practically we've talked about a charge-off ratio, 50 or 60 basis points through the cycle\u2026","Robert Q. Reilly","Being normalized, right\u2026","William S. Demchak","Yes, and we're running 16. So I don't expect that to happen in the visible future. But I'd put it out there as something of, you know, if you look at back earnings today, that would be a normalized charge-off rate and the offset to that in the right environment would be higher rates. We're just in this dislocated place where both remain abnormally low right now.","John Pancari","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","William S. Demchak","Yes.","End of Q&A","William H. Callihan","That concludes the call. I don't know, Bill, if you have any final summary remarks.","William S. Demchak","No, I just \u2013 real quickly, thank you for your time again today. We do think we've produced a solid 2014 for our shareholders, particularly within the things that we can control. We remain committed to growing this company across the strategic priorities we outlined. I think we have the ability to do that. I think it creates long-term value.","We do recognize that there's near term headwinds in the form of interest rates that we're going to have to work our way through. But there's nothing we can do to control that. It's a message you've heard from me for a while.","We'll continue on the path. We're not going to change our risk box. We continue to grow clients, grow the balance sheet through loans and deposits and we'll execute to the long-term. With that, thank you for your time this morning.","William H.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bill Callihan. Sir, please go ahead.","Bill Callihan","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to today\u2019s conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today\u2019s presentation contains forward-looking information. Our forward-looking statements regarding PNC\u2019s performance assume a continuation of the current economic conditions and do not take into account the impact of potential legal and regulatory contingencies. Actual results and future events could differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in our statements and from other historical performance due to a variety of risks and other factors.

These statements speak only as of April 16, 2014, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bill Demchak.","Bill Demchak","Thanks, Bill and good morning everyone. As you have seen this morning, we reported net income of $1.1 billion or $1.82 per diluted common share with a return on average assets of 1.35%. It was a good quarter for us highlighted by aggressive expense control and continued improvement in credit quality inside of a somewhat difficult revenue environment. You saw that we grew loans by $2.6 billion and deposits by about $1.5 billion. On the loan side, once again the growth came from the commercial side of our business with our retail balances actually declining slightly.","Expenses were down due to seasonality and our continued emphasis on improving efficiency throughout the organization. And Rob is going to take you through some details on this in his comments.","It\u2019s worth noting though that expenses were down even as we\u2019re making significant investments across our company to bolster our core infrastructure including cyber and to continue to support our ability to deliver the products and services that our customers want.","I mentioned it\u2019s been a tough revenue environment and in fact revenues declined quarter-over-quarter. Now, some of this decline reflects seasonally lower activity and a lower day count as well as a lower benefit from release of residential mortgage repurchase reserves. But beyond this, we remain in a low rate environment, fierce competition for earning assets as we try to outpace purchase accounting run-off and lower mortgage revenues with poor loan growth and fee growth across all of our lines of businesses.","While we lost that race in the first quarter, I am somewhat encouraged by the modest increases in utilization we\u2019ve seen in our commercial balances, the continued success of our specialty lending areas as well as our year-on-year growth in core non-interest income. We continue to make ongoing progress against our strategic priorities which I\u2019ve outlined here in the past. This quarter actually marked 2 years since we closed on our acquisition of RBC Bank USA.","Starting with only a retail branch network, we have fully built out our asset management and corporate banking businesses across the southeast. We now have about 4,000 frontline employees working across our markets in the southeast and we\u2019re growing the business there faster than we anticipated on the back of a significantly improved brand recognition. Now intense competition has made it somewhat more difficult to win new clients in certain segments than when we first arrived there, but across all lines of business we\u2019re pleased with growth that is outpacing the growth in our Northeast and Midwest markets and continues to gain momentum.","To highlight another of our strategic priorities, in the retail bank, customers continue to migrate to ATM online and mobile channels as their preferred vehicles for everyday transactions. And this year, we\u2019re focusing on piloting a conversion of our traditional branches to the universal branch model, which emphasizes consultation and sales. The transformation of our retail banking business is being self funded with the savings we\u2019re generating through our continuous improvement process.","As we\u2019ve said, our strategic priorities are long-term efforts and our intended to deliver a differentiated customer experience and to create long-term shareholder value. To that end, we continue to strengthen our capital position in the quarter and then keeping with our previously stated intention to return more capital to our shareholders, we announced an increase in our quarterly common stock dividend of 9% to $0.48 per share beginning with the May 2014 payment. We also announced plans to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of common stock over the next four quarters.","So with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Rob to take you through the first quarter results.","Rob Reilly","Thanks Bill and good morning everyone. Overall we had a successful first quarter. Our results were driven by continued loan and deposit growth, well controlled expenses and credit quality improvement. As is usually the case in the first quarter, seasonal factors affected revenue and expenses and I\u2019ll cover that in a moment. As Bill just discussed, these continued achievements are enabling us to return more capital to our shareholders.","Let me start with our balance sheet on slide four. As you can see, total assets on our balance sheet increased by $3.2 billion or 1% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily driven by net loan growth of $2.6 billion or 1.3%. Total commercial lending during the first quarter of 2014 grew $3.6 billion or 3%, primarily in real estate, corporate banking and business credit. And consumer lending was down by $1 billion or 1%, linked-quarter as increases in automobile lending were offset by declines in other consumer and residential mortgage lending.","Investment securities decreased by $1.7 billion or 2.7% in the first quarter as securities sales and prepayments exceeded purchases. And lastly, our balances with the Federal Reserve increased in anticipation of proposed rules on liquidity coverage standards.","Total deposits increased by $1.5 billion or 1% in the first quarter of this year. Deposit growth in the first quarter was primarily driven by increases in transaction deposits, which were up $1.7 billion or 1% related to growth in consumer transaction deposits including higher interest-bearing demand deposits.","Shareholders\u2019 equity increased by $987 million or 2.3% in the first quarter, primarily due to growth in retained earnings and to a lesser extent, higher AOCI related to net unrealized securities gains. This helped drive our capital ratios higher. As a result, our pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio was estimated to be 9.7% without the benefit of phase-ins as of March 31st, a 30 basis point increase from prior year-end. As we highlighted in our most recent 10-K, this ratio is computed using the standardized approach.","As you know, from a regulatory capital perspective, our binding constraint for 2014 is the transitional B3 ratio, which was estimated to be 10.8% as of March 31st.","As I mentioned, our balance sheet reflects our efforts to comply with the proposed liquidity coverage ratio. For example, our interest-earning deposits with banks, which are primarily with the Federal Reserve, increased by $2.7 billion on a linked-quarter basis and by more than $13 billion compared to the same time a year ago.","We increased total borrowings by $700 million or 2% linked-quarter and a substantial portion of this supported our enhanced liquidity position, as well as loan growth. As you know, the rules on LCR are still in proposed form; however we have a clear line of sight on reaching the final targets once they are established.","Finally, our tangible book value reached $56.33 per common share as of March 31, a 3.2% increase linked-quarter and a 12% increase year-over-year, reflecting our commitment to delivering shareholder value.","Turning to our income statement, as you can see on slide five, net income was $1.1 billion or $1.82 per diluted common share and our return on average assets was 1.35%. Our first quarter results for net interest income and non-interest income were as expected, while exceeding expectations on expenses and provision.","Let me highlight a few items in our income statement. Net interest income declined by $71 million or 3% compared to the fourth quarter. Virtually all of this decline was due to lower purchase accounting accretion of $28 million and fewer days in the quarter, which accounted for approximately $35 million. Importantly, core run rate NII remained relatively consistent with fourth quarter levels as loan growth substantially offset continued modest spread compression.","Non-interest income decreased by $225 million or 12% linked-quarter, primarily due to the higher fourth quarter benefit we had from the release of repurchase reserves and seasonal declines in fee income. I will provide more detail on this in a moment.","As a result, total revenue for the first quarter was $3.8 billion, a decline of $296 million or 7% compared to the fourth quarter consistent with our expectations.","With regard to expenses we were very pleased with our first quarter performance. Non-interest expense declined by $250 million or 10% compared to the fourth quarter as a result of overall disciplined expense management, as well as some seasonally favorable effects. Finally, provision in the first quarter declined to $94 million due to continued overall positive credit trends.","Comparing results to the prior year quarter, our net income was up $65 million or 7% primarily due to well managed expenses and lower credit costs. Now, let\u2019s discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail.","Turning to net interest income, as you can see on slide 6, total net interest income decreased by $71 million or 3% for the reasons I just highlighted. As you can see, purchase accounting accretion declined on a linked quarter basis consistent with our expectations. Looking ahead, we continue to expect purchase accounting accretion to be down approximately $300 million for full year 2014 compared to 2013.","Net interest margin declined by an overall 12 basis points linked quarter. Of that amount, approximately 4 basis points was attributable to the lower purchase accounting accretion while the remaining 8 basis point decline in core NIM, 4 basis points was due to the increased Fed balances as well as other LCR related actions. And the other 4 basis points was primarily due to spread compression at levels consistent with what we\u2019ve been experiencing for several quarters.","In terms of interest rate sensitivity, our balance sheet remained asset sensitivity as we have maintained the duration of equity of approximately negative 2 years. Going forward, we will continue to remain disciplined with the focus on achieving appropriate risk adjusted returns.","Turning to non-interest income, consistent with our expectations, our fee income declined by a $158 million or 11% on a linked quarter basis, primarily due to reserve releases related to our repurchase obligations and seasonal factors. However, excluding the impact of residential mortgage, the linked quarter decline in fee income was $48 million or 4%, largely reflecting seasonality. Year-over-year fee income increased $85 million or 8%.","Asset management fees held steady on a linked quarter basis reflecting stable equity markets. Compared to the same quarter a year ago asset management fees increased by $56 million or 18%. Assets under administration were $255 billion as of March 31st, an increase of $19 billion or 8% compared to the same time a year ago.","Consumer services fees and deposit services charges were both lower compared to fourth quarter results, again reflecting a seasonally lower volume of customer initiated transactions. Compared to the first quarter of last year, volumes underlying consumer services fees were up, brokerage fees increased $3 million or 6%, reflecting our strategic priorities, and deposit service charges increased $11 million or 8% as a result of growth in customer activity and changes in product offering.","Corporate services fees were flat linked quarter. Our merger and acquisition advisory fees were above typical first quarter activity but below their record fourth quarter volume. This decline was partially offset by a net increase in our CMSR valuation as a result of movement in interest rates. Compared to the first quarter of last year, corporate service fees increased by $24 million or 9%, driven by higher merger and acquisition advisory fee and capital markets activity.","Let me spend a few minutes discussing residential mortgage as fees declined by $110 million linked quarter. Virtually all of that was driven by the impact of the mortgage repurchase reserve release related to our settlement with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which we made in the fourth quarter.","In addition, we also saw lower loan sales revenue as originations volume fell to $1.9 billion in the first quarter from $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter and from $4.2 billion in the same quarter a year ago. While our volumes were down in both comparisons on a percentage basis, we experienced less decline than the broad industry.","The gain on sale margin was 453 basis points in the first quarter. As you know, our margins tend to be higher than the industry as we don\u2019t utilize the broker channel to originate loans. However, this quarter, our margins benefited even further due to favorable mark-to-market accounting adjustments. We continue to expect our margin to trend closer to 300 basis points through the remainder of 2014.","In regard to expenses, as you know, we announced expense reductions in Residential Mortgage during the fourth quarter of last year and we have fully captured those savings. Going forward, we will continue to monitor trends in the business and proactively manage expenses in line with revenues throughout 2014.","Other noninterest income decreased by a $134 million linked quarter, primarily due to lower revenue from private equity investments, which had a particularly strong fourth quarter. We also had lower credit valuations for customer related derivative activities and lower asset sales. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of the sale of Visa stock in the first quarter. Despite these all pressures, non-interest income to total revenue was 42% in the first quarter, down slightly from fourth quarter levels, but up 2 percentage points from the same quarter a year ago.","Turning to expenses on slide 8, first quarter levels were down by $250 million or 10% as a result of strong benefits from our continuous improvement broke ground, overall expense management and some seasonality.","As we previously stated, our CIP program has a goal to reduce costs by $500 in 2014. We\u2019re one quarter delay through the year and we\u2019ve already completed actions relating to capturing more than 35% of our goal. And as a result, we\u2019re confident we will achieve our full year target.","In addition to CIP savings, we had seasonally lower costs this quarter in virtually all categories. With these savings to-date, along with further planned activities, we intend to fund the significant investments we\u2019re making in our infrastructure and in our retail bank transformation.","One last item on expenses. During the first quarter, we did adopt new accounting guidance related to low income housing tax credits. As you are aware, this change reclassifies non-interest expenses on certain tax credit investments to tax expense with minimal impact to EPS. In line with accounting requirements, we did recast prior periods to reflect the impact of these changes. As a result, this changes year-over-year expense neutral and does not impact expense guidance. It does however increase our effective tax rate which we now expect to be approximately 26%.","As you can see on slide 9, overall credit quality continued to improve in the first quarter. Non-performing loans were down $141 million or 5% compared to the fourth quarter as we saw continuing broad based improvements across both commercial and consumer loan portfolios. Past due loans: Past due loans decreased by $264 million or 11% linked quarter and net charge-offs held steady. Net charge-offs for the first quarter were 38 basis points of average loans which was consistent with the ratio for the fourth quarter.","Our provision of $94 million declined by $19 million or 17% on a linked quarter basis and this was driven by continued improvements in credit quality and increases in home values. Finally, the allowance for loan and lease losses declined on both the linked quarter and a year-over-year basis and is now at 1.78%. While we were pleased with this performance, we continue to believe credit trends may not remain at these levels.","In summary, PNC posted a successful first quarter consistent with our expectations. Assuming a continuation of a current economic environment, we continue to expect that full year revenue will be under some pressure and as a result could likely be down year-over-year due to further purchase accounting accretion declines as well as lower residential mortgage revenues.","In this environment, we will remain focused on disciplined expense management and we continue to expect full year expenses to be down when compared to 2013. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect modest growth in loans, we expect net interest income to be down modestly due to the continued decline in purchase accounting accretion and further spread compression. We expect fee income to increase in the low single-digits, reflecting continued focus on our strategic priorities. We expect non-interest expense to be up by low single-digits as second quarter expenses typically increase compared to first quarter. And finally, assuming a continuation of current credit trends, we expect the provision for credit losses to be between $100 million and $150 million.","And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Good morning.","Bill Demchak","Good morning Matt.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Just to follow-up on some of the net interest income comments you made heading into 2Q, as we look at core net interest income ex the purchase accounting accretion, do you expect that to be relatively flat or what\u2019s the outlook for core NII and core NIM?","Rob Reilly","Yes. Sure Matt. So, our guidance is for the full NII and NIM, obviously when we say modestly down if you take out purchase accounting that modestly down decreases by a bit. But it\u2019s really going to be a function of what Bill mentioned in his comments, which is that rate so to speak between loans and yields. So that will determine the core NII levels and of course the core NIM.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay. So it sounds like it still might be under a little bit of pressure from hearing you correctly in 2Q?","Rob Reilly","Well, I think yields are certainly under pressure and then the loan growth is in terms of the modest growth that we expect to be seeing would offset that.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then on expenses, obviously better than expected this quarter, should we think about that as flowing through for rest of the year that you\u2019re going to beat some of the targets, you\u2019re at 35% already or were you able to front-end some of it and just stick to kind of the original expectation?","Rob Reilly","Yes. Sure Matt. The short answer is, it\u2019s too early to extrapolate our first quarter results. We\u2019re pleased with the level in terms of the $250 million decrease linked-quarter. So we\u2019re pleased that that performance prompts that question. But there is seasonality involved there; there are further investments in the business that we\u2019re going to make in the balance of the year. So, it\u2019s too early to extrapolate that, but it is safe to conclude that we\u2019re off to a good start.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then just lastly, at this point, you guys expect to use all of your buyback capacity that you were approved for from the Fed on the CCAR?","Bill Demchak","We shall see, right? We\u2019re going to just kick that off. We are obviously value dependent to some point to some extent. We see value where we are today. So, maybe I\u2019ll leave it at that and we\u2019ll see where we end up as we go through the year.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. O\u2019Connor. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Mr. Paul Miller from FBR. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Miller - FBR","Yes. Thank you very much. Can you address a little bit on the Southern I guess, the RBC franchise, where that is, and then how is that growing year-over-year? Just add color around that, those comments.","Bill Demchak","Sure. Just anecdotally, across virtually all of our lines of businesses, the growth in the Southeast is outpacing what we\u2019re doing in our legacy franchises. Surprisingly to me at least probably most pronounced on the retail side where client growth there is much higher than legacy markets.","C&IB and wealth kind of starting from scratch, continue to add good clients and loan balances and fee income inside of wealth. So, it\u2019s progressing well largely across all of the markets that we acquired.","It\u2019s coming, we\u2019ve said this before, it\u2019s coming certainly in terms of C&IB and wealth off of such a small base, their percentages are massive in terms of increases. The impact to our bottom-line, it\u2019s still early days and that will grow through time.","Paul Miller - FBR","And then can you talk a little bit about the competitive nature especially in the CRE books? We\u2019re hearing a lot of some regional banks talk about that there are more and more people at the table, be it insurance companies, smaller regional banks and what not. How competitive is that CRE market out there right now and C&I, I should say?","Bill Demchak","Well, let\u2019s just start on real estate, I mean you have to remember the capacity that left the market post crisis with the European banks pulling back. A lot of that slack being -- the slack from that and then the CMBS market shrinking being taken up by insurance companies and new bank entrants. The competition in the market is accelerated, as I look at sort of our spread declines quarter-on-quarter or over the last 6 months is probably most accelerated inside at real estate, structures are still good. I think one of the things that we benefit from is because we lent straight through the crisis to our core good Class A clients. They continue to come back to us. So, we need to be on market, we don\u2019t need to be through market. We continue to see good growth again led by multifamily, some term stuff on balance sheet, a pickup and office properties and even a little bit in lodging.","On the C&I side, it\u2019s a tough fight. It\u2019s harder and harder to pull certainly versus the crisis to pull a client away from a competitor. Interestingly, the spread declines seem to have slowed down relative to what we were kind of marching through last year and it varies by segment. So on the specialty businesses and asset-based lending, certain public finance products and equipment leasing; there is less providers, so therefore less competition and a little bit more room on spread. The generic product is tough.","Paul Miller - FBR","Okay. Thank you very much, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Good morning.","Bill Demchak","Good morning.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","My first question, if we could just get a little bit more detail on the LCR. I was just wondering does your guidance for net interest income for the remainder of the year include the balance sheet actions that you plan to take for LCR. And underneath that, how should we think about the dynamic of balance sheet growth versus loan growth as you build liquidity? And is the 4 basis point impact from liquidity action this quarter going to be a similar impact in the following quarters?","Rob Reilly","Yes okay, Erika this is Rob. I will try to answer most of that, remind me what I didn\u2019t answer. In regard to the liquidity coverage ratio and our efforts to move in compliance, as you know the rules aren\u2019t finalized yet so we are moving towards that somewhat of an unknown target. That said, we have done quite a bit. And that has shown up in our net interest income and our NIM. Last quarter you will recall 7 basis points of our NIM contraction was LCR related, in this quarter as I said in my comments it\u2019s four basis points.","So, where we don\u2019t know where the final stop is, I think it is sufficient to say that we are more than half way there in the bulk of what we experienced in NIM compression related to LCR activities based on what we know now is more behind us than ahead of us.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Got it. And Bill you\u2019ve really delivered on what you had talked about last year in terms of expense management and your efficiency ratio was 60% this quarter. As we think about your guidance for full year and for next quarter, do you think you could keep your efficiency ratio at the 60% level for the duration of a year? And given your strong comments on RBC, does that contemplate upside or does it -- could we be surprised any upside by the contribution from your southeast franchise?","Bill Demchak","I think we\u2019ve given, Rob has kind of given you all the guidance, we\u2019re going to give you in terms of level one detail, but some colored commentary. First on the expenses, I didn\u2019t deliver the company deliver. And it\u2019s an important point that the franchise really has gotten its arms around the importance of saving money to reinvest money and the importance of improving our efficiency ratio.","The end result of that, we\u2019re going to play out this year if we continue to see positive trends in loan growth whether from the southeast or simply from some of the utilization increase we have seen in our C&I space maybe there is upside to it and then that will roll through to the efficiency ratio. But we\u2019re one quarter into the year. We had a strange first quarter just in terms of weather-related impact and some of the seasonality so I don\u2019t know exactly how to extrapolate from here and give you anything more than what Rob already gave you.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Okay. Thank you for answering my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning.","Bill Demchak","Good morning.","Rob Reilly","Good morning.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Couple of questions one is on the reinvestments, I am just wondering if you feel that the reinvestments that you are making into the franchise are at run rate in first quarter or are they accelerating as you go through the rest of this year?","Bill Demchak","Two answers of that question. The investments show-up in terms of cash spent, not necessarily in terms of expense yet because a lot of them are capitalized and then depreciated through time, so we will, we\u2019re probably investing at a steady phase for a period of time with depreciation to roll-on somewhere down the line as we take out further costs to fund the depreciation.","So we\u2019re early days in what we are investing and the end outcome of these investments particularly as it relates to our infrastructure and operational areas is more efficient back office and better customer service through automation and less manual process. So we\u2019re spending the dollars steady state, you are not necessarily seeing that inside of the expense line directly today.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay, got it. And then the second question just has to do with CCAR, I\u2019m just wondering how you felt the process went this year and looking to understand, do you think that they are, all that seems equal, which is I know is a aggressive statement, but all that seems equal, do you feel like there is any room for bumping up the request into 2015, I mean because your gross payout ratio roughly 55%ish now at least in our numbers and mid 40s it feels like there is a lot of opportunity there for reinvesting in the franchise maybe, lot of capital accretion. So, just wondering what you\u2019re seeing in the process this year and do you think there is room to bump it up into next year?","Bill Demchak","Too early to comment on next year, but one of the things that did happen this year, if you look at our results versus the federal reserve\u2019s results and this was true for all of our peers, their asset growth assumption in result and risk-weighted assets. The differential between patterns where we were was largely the difference between their outcome and ours.","I\u2019ll remind you that we talk about the binding constraint being the obvious comment, the ending ratio not the starting ratio and we obviously had room on a phased in Basel III number this year, where conceivably we could have done more, we think we did a lot. We will reevaluate next year as a function of what they are going to look at in terms of how they calculate the bottom number vis-\u00e0-vis Basel III.","Our intention and I\u2019d probably just leave it here, our intention is to return more rather than less inside of a fairly complexed framework in terms of both what we measure as to what we have available and what they think we have available.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","I guess the question is essentially because, you end up accreting capital otherwise unless the payout ratios go up and then it built into the questions around, spread compression and competition, try to use [life] as a capital?","Bill Demchak","No, look it is the right question, right. So whether we go from 55% to 65% to 75% to 90%, right we\u2019re going to continue to build the capital base that inside of our own plans given our assumptions that we\u2019re not going to be buying anything any time soon, effectively built capital levels for us.","You guys use the term capital trap, but what do you do about it. One of the things that I think we and the rest of the industry, I should just speak for we, one of the things I think eventually happens is that we move beyond what we would do directly and share repurchase is a way to return capital into sort of annual special dividend as part of this process, I don\u2019t know when that is, but it\u2019s quite clear to me that all else equal, they will stay just the way they are we and the rest of the industry are going to book capital levels well beyond what the required minimums are.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Yes, because you\u2019ve got this hypothetical CCAR in the real world trapped capital issue, right?","Bill Demchak","Yes. And we also have inside of the earnings assumptions or the revenue assumptions in the base case of CCAR, we have some inconsistencies versus what we would actually think we can make because we don\u2019t count certain revenues in CCAR that for us are repeatable and recurring. So there is a disconnect on that side as well.","Rob Reilly","This is Rob, just to emphasize those points that issue is largely an industry issue.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Right, exactly. Okay, thanks.","Operator","And thank you for your questions. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Keith Murray from ISI. Please go ahead Mr. Murray.","Keith Murray - ISI","Thank you. Good morning.","Bill Demchak","Good morning, Keith.","Keith Murray - ISI","Could you just clarify, you mentioned the mark-to-market accounting adjustment that benefited the gain on sale of mortgage, is there a dollar amount you can give or basis point impact benefit to the margin there?","Rob Reilly","Yes, it\u2019s pretty straight forward; it\u2019s relatively small $24 million basis points 125 or so.","Keith Murray - ISI","Okay, thanks. And then on deposit service charges and overdraft behavior obviously there is seasonality in the first quarter. But have you seen a meaningful change in consumer behavior on that and how does that impact your view on that line item going forward?","Bill Demchak","We have an overdraft where it\u2019s been pressure on numbers in front of me, but been pressured year-on-year largely I think because of consumer behavior.","Keith Murray - ISI","Okay. And then on the LCR, does that change your view on commercial deposits and have you adjusted pricing on those deposits yet or is that something that\u2019s still a work in progress given its early stages?","Bill Demchak","On the commercial side, deposit pricing is pretty competitive to outright market rates, I think money market type yields and have been and we continue to be there. Those deposits don\u2019t count for much inside of LCR though, right? So transaction deposits are where it makes a difference or where money market accounts with consumers. And we are changing pricing at the margin as it relates to those products.","Part of the issue, Rob mentioned the rules aren\u2019t finalized yet as we try to figure out how much of a gap we have or don\u2019t have; there is 2 or 3 items that they\u2019re still working through the LCR common process related to look through on securitizations, municipal deposits, some draw rates on other products that have a material impact on our outcome.","And so, we\u2019re not in a huge hurry to change what we\u2019re doing today until we know what the final rules are because we don\u2019t want to do long-term structural change the way we fund ourselves unless we have to.","Rob Reilly","And that the rules are clear.","Bill Demchak","Yes.","Rob Reilly","And filed.","Keith Murray - ISI","Understood. And just finally I am sitting on pretty sizeable unrealized gains filled with Visa shares, going forward if you would realize some of that your thoughts around capital planning there, is that something maybe you would go and revisit with the Fed as far as doing, repurchasing shares with those gains?","Bill Demchak","We\u2019ve been pretty clear through time that we\u2019ll monetize the Visa stake through time as we see value, we\u2019ve been doing that fairly consistently for the last couple of years. Given what we might do this year, I don\u2019t see us going back for the federal money mature if we could to go back and request additional capital actions. It obviously adds to our capital base which will come into play for next year, as we take gains this year though.","Rob Reilly","Yes. And just to add to that the stake, at the end of the quarter about 9.5 million shares worth $850 million on our books worth $130 million, so then realized gain is just north of $700 million.","Keith Murray - ISI","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of John McDonald from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead sir.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Hi. I think Bill in the beginning mentioned some signs of modest improvement in line utilizations on the commercial side. Could you add some color on what you are seeing there, Bill and any hope for what might be driving that?","Bill Demchak","Yes. So, it\u2019s early days but we\u2019ve seen a decent chunk of the growth in the first quarter and C&I come through utilization increases interestingly for the first time in a really long time in the middle market book. So the plain vanilla revolver middle market corporate America were popped up I think 50 basis points plus or minus.","We\u2019ve actually seen a continuation of that into the front couple of weeks of April. Now, I would tell you with all sorts of caveats that people tell me that utilization typically does pop in the second quarter, so maybe that\u2019s just seasonal and it\u2019s going to go away. The bull case on this whole thing is, if you look, if you follow the CEO Confidence Index and people have been showing me these chats where you kind of regret that against capital expenditures. It is highly correlated and we\u2019ve seen that the CEO index increase. So maybe we\u2019re finally getting the pop in capital expenditures which are driving these line increases. But we\u2019re quarter into the year, we had a weird couple of months to the start of the year because of weather. And [a boy] I\u2019d like to continue to trend, but I can\u2019t tell you it\u2019s going to happen yet.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And Rob on the fee income outlook any color on what you\u2019re looking to as the drivers of improvement in the second quarter on the fee income side?","Rob Reilly","Yes. And I think it\u2019s pretty straight forward John. There is a seasonality effect and we\u2019ll get the lift there. And then in addition to that, it\u2019s just returns on the investments and the strategic emphasis that we put on those businesses.","Bill Demchak","We had some weird quarter-to-quarter swings too with CVA impacting results and Harris Williams traditionally has it and did last year a really strong fourth quarter. We saw weakness in corporate bond fees in the first quarter while we\u2019re less dependent on it. But nonetheless, it impacts our number along with the rest of large banks reporting capital markets income. That on the normalize out. And when you get over the year end the effects, pretty confident that we would do well in the second quarter.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And then last thing on the provision outlook, Rob can you break that down a little bit just in terms of what you\u2019re assuming for charge-offs going forward and reserve release breaking down between those 2 items.","Rob Reilly","Yes, sure. So charge-offs in the first quarter were -- net charge-offs were $186 million, our provision was $94 million, which generated a 92 release. Going forward, assuming credit quality and credit trends all stay consistent we see net charge-offs in a similar kind of range which is where they have been for a while.","Provision: Our provision guidance in terms of that 100 to 150 is our estimate in terms of sort of what we are seeing. And if that all plays out, we would have further releases although not necessarily at the same level in the first quarter.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. McDonald continuing on our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Thanks a lot. Robert, I wanted to ask you a little bit about balance sheet efficiency. Loans have been out growing deposits and you are also obviously doing the build for mix I should say shift for LCR. And so you have done a double dose of both bank note senior debt and FHLB. I guess as you look out and you think about the best mix going forward, should loan growth continue to outpace deposits, how do you think about the right mix of liabilities looking ahead?","Rob Reilly","That\u2019s a big part of the effort obviously Ken, particularly in terms of the LCR. So to the extent that the LCR is part of that we have been pretty clear in terms of we are moving along in terms of where we think we are going but not quite sure where the final target is. In regard to loan and deposits, we remain core funded. We plan to stay that way. You are correct that loans at least recently I think growing faster than deposits. And that\u2019s something that we manage actively, but that core funding is our philosophy and we continue to manage in that direction.","Bill Demchak","If you are thinking of the deposit growth numbers, we continue to run off sort of non-core and CD not having as much impact on our margin as it once did. But I believe and somebody can correct me here if I am wrong, I think our core transaction deposits are actually outpacing loan growth; it\u2019s just the run off in the CD balances that are causing that mix to shift. So, I think as we kind of burn through the residual of the non-core, we\u2019re actually running a much more balanced production of deposits against loans. Were that to change, right, the levers we have certainly on the consumer side, which are morality or friendly is to get more aggressive inside the money market space on rate paid, which probably in this environment doesn\u2019t make a huge difference, but as rates begin to rise through time, I think we\u2019ll move flows.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay. And then just one more clarification on the LCR build. You are doing the remix and Rob I heard your point that you are further along towards, and then further away. But when you think about the overall size of the securities portfolio as a proportion of the balance sheet, are we also at the right spot or should we still expect there to be just net growth over time?","Bill Demchak","Net growth in the securities balances?","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Yes.","Bill Demchak","Not necessarily. So, you see, the decline on spot balance is towards the first. That duration was replaced largely inside of the swap book, just received fixed on swap. So, the other thing inside of our securities book today is a lot of the stuff that we own is floating rate and not adding duration.","So, our ability to get the duration we need in a higher rate environment can be done, as you know, with same notionals and longer duration of the underlying securities and\/or the swap book. And all of that will be a function of market opportunity. But one thing we have done is inside of the securities book, the percentage of that book that is level one, securities has increased through time, right? So, to the extent that it\u2019s on our balance sheet and level one is not really impacting our LCR calculation versus just having cash set at the Fed.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Right. Okay. And then my last one, just when you -- the commentary about NII coming down in the second quarter is clear, but I\u2019m just wondering, we know about obviously a $300 million of accretion and we know that your point about loan yields coming in and Bill your point to just about this remixing issue, but how do you size for us the magnitude of core margin compression that you see is being left just given on the rollover effects on the asset side?","Bill Demchak","It\u2019s a good question. How low can it go?","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Yes. I mean really that\u2019s a question, right, I think because I think people are wondering why can\u2019t core grow, because obviously we know NII is going to be down just because of the purchase accounting pressures, but I guess the question underlies is how you -- what stops them to believe of the core NIM compression if I could just ask as that simply then?","Bill Demchak","I think inside of that number you have the impacts from loans and the impact from securities yield. And on the loan side, we are kind of grinding lower on average spread across the book at a slower pace than we once were. So, maybe we\u2019re approaching some neutral point. Securities balances, we\u2019ve again seen yields, we got excited that tenure went over 3% for a day and that is back down. So, reinvestment yield and securities continues to be less than the average yield on a book by a fair margin. And in fact if anything we continue to get shorter in that book rather than longer given the opportunity we see on where yields are. So that -- look at the end of the day, we have $58 billion of securities yielding what 3, a little over 3%. We\u2019re reinvesting to the extent we do at 2.5%. So, you get 50 basis points and $58 billion over $300 billion, you can do the math and run it through our margins.","Rob Reilly","That sounds good, something similar to what we saw in the first quarter of last year.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Yes.","Bill Demchak","So that switches almost instantaneously, if we trade again back to the top-end of the range in yields that we\u2019ve kind of been bouncing around for the -- I keep talking about the tenure, but it\u2019s really the middle of the curve that we focus on.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Yes, got it. All right, great. Thanks for the help.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Continuing on, your next question comes from the line of Steve Scinicariello. Please proceed and he is from UBS.","Steve Scinicariello - UBS","Good morning everyone.","Bill Demchak","Good morning.","Steve Scinicariello - UBS","Hey, I just wanted to get a little color just given really the strong loan growth especially on the commercial side. Just kind of curious where you\u2019re seeing kind of the best risk adjusted returns across some of those sub-segments and sectors?","Rob Reilly","Yes. Sure. I can answer that. In terms of the loan growth most of it is coming from the C&IB space as we mentioned and within that in the quarter commercial real estate, further improvement in commercial real estate, corporate banking to Bill\u2019s point around the middle-market book and business credit. And I think probably those are the areas with the exception of the middle-market where we\u2019re seeing the better spread, specialty businesses, commercial real estate and business credit in particular done equipment spending.","Bill Demchak","And just on return on Rob is our asset-based book is probably the best we have. But we don\u2019t -- we measure return across our client not just on the credit extension. So, inside the corporate book where the returns on the loans and sales might be marginally lower, the return on the client given cross-sell off treasury management and other products typically makes it really attractive.","Steve Scinicariello - UBS","Makes sense. And then you had mentioned kind of the amount of capacity that has gone out of the system whether it\u2019s the foreign banks, the CMBS market et cetera, how long a runway do you think you guys have? Should it be something we should measure in terms of years potentially or how big is this kind of market share opportunity that companies like you have?","Bill Demchak","It\u2019s probably measured in years if for no other reason and a substantial part of our growth continues to be in project loans, which fund up over the course of a couple of years by definition, yes. We have seen spreads come in, in that segment, but risk adjusted returns still look pretty good.","And as I said before, we have seen that the partnerships we had and supported through the downturn continue to reward us with business in a way that that isn\u2019t necessarily jumped off of the highest bidder credit provider which is great.","Steve Scinicariello - UBS","Perfect. Thank you so much.","Operator","And thank you for your question. Moving on next, our next question comes from the line Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Thank you. Good morning guys. Bill, I got a question on the capital levels for PNC. Where do you think the Tier 1 common ratio should get to where you\u2019re comfortable to say that that\u2019s enough, or and if you can\u2019t really answer that today, what do we need to see whether it\u2019s from the regulators or from you folks to where you can say at this point, okay we are very comfortable with our capital levels, we don\u2019t want them to go any higher from where they are?","Bill Demchak","Look, it\u2019s a great question, but the way I am going to answer it is, will get backwards. So, we basically want to be able to say that in an adverse case, our capital ratio won\u2019t drop below the 7% threshold. And in a severely adverse flow, the 4.5 inclusive of those 2 things, we\u2019d also run a buffer that\u2019s a function of some of our idiosyncratic risk.","So, I define my starting point as a function of my ending point and struggle with giving you a number on the starting point is every year we get hit with a new scenario. And even when we can expect what the scenario is, we might get hit with a rule change. So this year kind of at the 11th hour, we had loan balances grow in the Fed case. We don\u2019t necessarily think that what happened, but nonetheless that\u2019s what they ran in their numbers.","So that\u2019s our challenge. I would like to think that we\u2019re at a level today that supports, and I do think that we\u2019re at a level today that supports our needs and is above what our threshold ought to be. We then get back to the issue of what can I actually do about it being so high given that we have constraints on how much we can return to shareholders through the capital return request.","So, I think we\u2019re where we need to be. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re supposed to grow from here, mechanically we may end up growing.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Thank you. And regarding your comments a moment ago about the special dividend, which I concur with, have you bounced that off of the regulators yet, are they in that mode of thinking about it recognizing, nobody is doing it, I don\u2019t think this year, but has that entered into the discussion yet with the Fed?","Bill Demchak","It has. Yes, it has entered into discussion not in any formal sense, so I brought up in discussions. So I think of course the issue with dividends is the repeatability of it, if it\u2019s a special dividend then in fact, it\u2019s a one-time request not the similar from the share repurchase. The issue we will face should things trend that direction has been able to get a valuation multiple, effectively the repeatability of that special dividend, so that shareholders value beyond just the one time.","All that needs to be worked through. But I think at some point, I mean if you just run through in our case, the potential capital return, at some point we are appropriately price sensitive to where we would be buying back shares and at some point, returning capital through dividend is I think a smarter long-term thing for our shareholders.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Sure. On the universal branches, is there a target of where you eventually want that number to reach as a percentage of your total branch footprint? Is it someday in five plus years a 100% or where do you see that number going?","Bill Demchak","Well, it\u2019s certainly going to grow; it\u2019s kind of in pilot phase if that\u2019s all right. We\u2019re kind of learning from experience in the customer experience inside those branches and tweaking it as we go. But you got to remember that somewhere down the road, if you think of touch points with our retail clients; we will have what looks like a traditional branch, but it will be a universal branch. We\u2019ll also have lots micro branches and technology branches, effectively, a smart ATM.","So, our full service branches being universal branches I would think that most if not all of them would transform into that model or whatever that, however we perfect that model. But beyond that we\u2019re going to have a lot of branches that are more technology-based and may have fewer, if any employees.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Great. And speaking of technology, Bank of America held their call this morning and Brian Moynihan mentioned that they are spending $3.5 billion a year in technology.","Bill Demchak","We have been processing.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","What are you guys -- I hope so. Do you guys have a number that you could share with us and what you're spending on this initiative to make these branches more in the 21st century than prior time period?","Bill Demchak","We haven't put a specific number out there. Our capital spend so across technology and just physical plant if we, some of this is just rolling out image-enabled ATMs and some other things. It is 20%, 30% higher than a run rate we might have had a handful of years ago and it will be elevated for a couple of years. That's probably the best I can give you. Again we expect on the back-end of this through automation to takeout manual process that largely funds it.","But it's not just, some of this is [the client] facing technology, which is important, but a big part of it is core infrastructure and cyber, it's resiliency, it is ease of use for our employees and customers, it's big data. It's all the stuff that I think it takes to be a leading edge bank as we move into the future here.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","And then just my final question, I\u2019m looking on my screen at your January 2010 slide deck where you put out the framework for success, your long-term goals and impressively you have met just about every one of them. Is that kind of slide can we see something like that again where you put out where you hit the ROE target in a 130 basis points at the time you are in 62 et cetera. Something like that in the future possibly?","Bill Demchak","We can say it question a lot. People asking can we kind of put aspirational targets out there and most of you have heard my speech and I struggle with doing that because if you tell me an interest rate environment I will tell you an ROA and ROE. We need to do more though in terms of talking about the power and potential of this franchise and it\u2019s something we are working on and I would expect that one of the upcoming conferences will go through that in some detail.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","I Appreciate it. Thank you, Bill.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Cassidy. (Operator Instructions). Gentlemen, our next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell from Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question sir.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess Bill a question for you, you have mentioned a couple of times on the call today that you think the relative to buyback that your stock is currently is that a value that encourages you to think about doing $1.5 billion in buybacks that you have been approved for, I guess I just want to get a little more into your thinking as to at what point does that valuation is currently about 1.5 times your stated tangible book value get a little bit dicier in terms of buying back? And then in a related question what type of loan growth scenario would you want to see before you started thinking about not meeting your $1.5 billion buyback target?","Bill Demchak","Well, just on value on the shares I am not going to go down the path of telling you a price target and where I am a buyer and where I am not other than just say as we said before we see value where we are today and we\u2019ll play it out from there. As it relates to loan growth independent of share price performance here I don\u2019t see in any viable scenario where loan growth will impact that.","Rob Reilly","That\u2019s right.","Bill Demchak","I mean it would have to be some unachievable percentage before we\u2019d run into a constraint vis-\u00e0-vis our buyback driven just by asset growth as opposed to where we\u2019re seeing value and shares.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. And then maybe question for Rob, in the presentation you all made in February you mentioned about 5% of your transactions in \u201813 were done via the mobile route. And I guess I am just curious if you\u2019re seeing a greater level of pick up in mobile banking activity and products in the newer markets i.e. in the Southeast relative to your more traditional markets or is it roughly similar across your franchise.","Rob Reilly","Just a clarification in terms of non-teller transaction or deposit activities, the numbers were more a year ago 18% to now in the 30% range. And in terms of the southeast, not necessarily seeing a higher percentage, it\u2019s pretty much a clean double across all of our markets, we went through that monthly sale ago and it\u2019s in the 30% range and in all of our legacy markets as well as the Southeast.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. Just\u2026","Rob Reilly","Yes, which were ahead of it.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Yes. Just for clarification on the February deck you have on page 12 you have mobile transactions at about 5% of total deposit transaction, that\u2019s really the number\u2026","Rob Reilly","That might not have included the ATM. Yes we focus on non-tailor but the mobile are increasing commensurately as well.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Rob Reilly","Sure.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Burnell. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Brian Foran from Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research","Hi, good morning.","Bill Demchak","Good morning.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research","Bill, I know you\u2019ve talked a lot about technology, both on this call and really for a couple of years now and you\u2019ve also been pretty consistent about [DM] sizing M&A as part of the go forward strategy. You gave an interview, maybe a week or two ago now where I think you linked those more clearly than I remember, you had before and I\u2019m going to paraphrase it poorly, but basically saying any deal, even if it\u2019s pretty small really slows down your ability to change technology and the franchise. I was wondering if you could [twist] it out generally and maybe specifically is that a near-term change in thinking, this year just had a lot of technology and shift and so to it\u2019s sort of big year issue or do you think that\u2019s something longer term where technology change organically has just become more valuable than M&A and cost saves and revenue synergies?","Bill Demchak","I mean I think it\u2019s a near-term issue. Our issue is when you do an integration particularly one that it involves consumer accounts, loan accounts, you basically map the two technologies together field-to-field, record-to-record and you have to freeze everything, because at some point you are going to move all of those files over under the remaining system.","So any application updates that you might be doing in the ordinary course during that mapping process, you have to stop. Our particular issue is that because we had been pretty active acquirers over the last multiple years, we froze changes that we probably should have made. So now we\u2019re catching up, we\u2019re getting applications up to speed, we\u2019re refreshing datacenters, we\u2019re improving cyber, we\u2019re doing a lot of things. I don\u2019t want to freeze that progress to do a small bank deal, even if I saw value in a small bank deal, which today we don\u2019t which is a separate issue.","Down the road, it actually becomes a competitive advantage if you have a technology platform that would allow you to integrate faster, that's a good thing. So it's kind of near-term priority for us to get our technology agenda behind us. I don't think there is any opportunity cost associated with that, because we don't see value in small deals today that may change later.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research","Thank you. I appreciate it.","Operator","And thank you sir. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio from KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Mutascio - KBW","Thank you. Good morning Bill and Rob. How are you?","Bill Demchak","Just great.","Chris Mutascio - KBW","Good. Rob just a quick question for you on the fee income guidance. I saw a couple of numbers out here, but I just want to make sure I have this right. You are expecting low single-digit type growth first quarter to second, if I use, just for the sake of argument, use 3%, I\u2019m not putting words in your mouth, so that gets you to about $1.63 billion in second quarter. But then if I back out the [Visa] gains and also the gain on sale of margin benefit you had in first quarter, first quarter I don\u2019t want to call, but first quarter could have been more or like $1.49 billion. So the difference in your guidance and first quarter extra gain on sale and extra Visa is about a 9% increase or about a $140 million increase. So, does that imply additional Visa gains in the second quarter in your guidance or is this all made up by seasonality?","Rob Reilly","Yes. That's a good question. But that's -- and really it's not any guidance around Visa. Your question really relates to the other non-interest income, which a short answer is we average $300 million there on that line. We were down this quarter in the first quarter would largely drive that category and there is a number of sub-categories, so it largely drives that category; our private equity investments, credit valuation adjustments and loan, our asset sales. And in the first quarter, all three of those were down linked-quarter, which if unusual in our history that all three of those categories are down simultaneously. They are unrelated, but that\u2019s what occurred in the first quarter. So, the short answer is, we still feel good in terms of our guidance, but that $300 million number not including Visa is a good number for the other.","Chris Mutascio - KBW","Great, thank you very much.","Bill Demchak","Sure.","Bill Callihan","[Penna], with that I think we are well over our allotted time. So I think we are going to wrap up the call now, Bill do you have any closing remarks?","Bill Demchak","Just quickly again to reiterate where we are; we continue to be focus on strategic priorities which we are making good progress on. We are intensely focused on controlling expenses because they are the one thing we can drive here in what is a tough revenue environment. I am pleased with the organization\u2019s progress as we go into the Southeast and against our other priorities, we\u2019ll play the year out here, but I think we are in pretty good shape. So, continue to deliver for shareholders, I\u2019ll just end there.","Bill Callihan","Great, thank you all for attending today\u2019s call.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now turn the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bryan Gill. Sir, please go right ahead.","Bryan Gill","Well, thank you and good morning. And welcome to today\u2019s conference call for The PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC\u2019s Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today\u2019s presentation contains forward-looking information. Our forward-looking statements regarding PNC performance assume a continuation of the current economic trends and do not take into account the impact of potential legal and regulatory contingencies.","Actual results and future events could differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in our statements and from historical performance due to a variety of risks and other factors. Information about such factors, as well as GAAP reconciliations and other information on non-GAAP financial measures we discuss is included in today\u2019s conference call, earnings release and related presentation materials and in our 10-K, 10-Qs and other SEC filings and investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of October 13, 2017 and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bill Demchak.","Bill Demchak","Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everybody. As you have seen this morning, PNC reported net income of $1.1 billion or $2.16 per diluted common share in the third quarter. As Rob is going to lay out in more detail in just a second, this is a good quarter for us. Couple of things stood out. I\u2019m just going to comment on those very quickly before I turn it over to Rob.","First, we continued to experience solid loan growth driven by our commercial lending business and we saw some growth on the consumer side as well. Within the commercial business, we\u2019re growing loans and adding clients around a diversified product offering and we\u2019re capitalizing on opportunities in our underpenetrated and newer markets.","Importantly, we haven\u2019t changed our credit standards here, and there is in one particular lending product that stands out. But in the end, we\u2019re effectively executing on a model that\u2019s based on patience, consistency of coverage and good ideas. And this loan growth together with a higher interest rates and continued low betas on our deposit pricing, allowed us to grow net interest income, even as security balances declined slightly.","Second, on the fee revenue side, we saw a drop in corporate services fees, which was largely expected given that we\u2019d had a record second quarter. And notwithstanding that, this is actually the second best quarter ever for non-interest income in C&IB. You\u2019ll notice, we also saw provision up to at least in part to the impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma along with loan growth and some seasonal consumer trends. And beyond that, it\u2019s a pretty uneventful quarter.","Rob is going to quickly take you through the results and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Over to your, Rob.","Rob Reilly","Okay. Good morning. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone.","As Bill just mentioned, our third quarter net income was $1.1 billion or $2.16 per diluted common share. Our balance sheet is on slide four and is presented on an average basis. Total loans grew by $2.9 billion or 1% linked quarter. Commercial lending was up $2.7 billion from the second quarter as we saw growth in our secured lending businesses as well as large corporate in middle markets. Consumer lending increased by approximately $200 million linked quarter, driven by growth in residential mortgage, auto and credit card, partially offset by lower home equity and education loans, which included our run-off portfolios. Investment securities decreased by approximately $900 million or 1% linked quarter, as a result of lower reinvestments due in part to a relatively less attractive market opportunity during the third quarter. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, securities were up $2.8 billion or 4%. Our interest earning deposits with banks mostly at the Federal Reserve were $23.9 billion for the third quarter, up $1.3 billion from the second quarter.","On the liability side, total deposits increased by $3.1 billion or 1% compared to the second quarter, driven by seasonal growth in commercial deposits. Average shareholders\u2019 equity increased by approximately $300 million linked quarter and we continue to return substantial capital to shareholders. During the third quarter, our capital return totaled to $898 million, comprised to $535 million in share repurchases and $363 million in common dividends. This resulted in a payout ratio of approximately 86%. Period-end common shares outstanding were 476 million, down 12 million or 2% compared to the same time a year ago. As of September 30, 2017, our fully phased-in Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was estimated to be 9.8%.","As you can see on slide five, net income was $1.1 billion and we continued to generate positive operating leverage on both the linked quarter and year-to-date basis. Revenue was up $65 million or 2% from the second quarter, driven by growth in net interest income. Non-interest expense remained well-managed and decreased by $23 million or 1% compared to the second quarter.","Provision for credit losses in the third quarter was $130 million and included $10 million related to hurricanes Harvey and Irma. In addition, loan growth and some seasonality in the performance of certain consumer categories contributed to the increase.","Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 26.8%. For the full year 2017, we continue to expect the effective tax rate to be between 25% and 26%.","Turning to slide six. Our third quarter performance is reflected in these metrics, which have all improved over the past year. Our return on average assets for the third quarter was 1.2%, our return on average common equity was 9.89%, our return on tangible common equity was 12.66%, and our tangible book value increased to $69.72 per common share as of September 30th.","We believe our well-positioned balance sheet, diversified revenue mix, and focus on expense management provides momentum for us to continue to deliver strong results.","Now, let\u2019s discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail.","Turning to slide seven. Revenue increased by $296 million or 8% year-over-year, driven by higher net interest income of $250 million or 12% and non-interest income growth of $46 million or 3%. It\u2019s worth noting that our fee income on a year-to-date basis was a record setting $4.3 billion, reflecting efforts to grow our fee-based businesses with increases in every category except for residential mortgage. On a linked quarter basis, net interest income increased by $87 million or 4%. The increase was driven by higher loan yields and balances, partially offset by higher funding costs. Additionally, the third quarter of this year benefited from one additional day compared to the second quarter.","Our net interest margin expanded by 7 basis points linked quarter to 2.91%, driven by higher interest rates. And our third quarter non-interest income decreased slightly linked quarter. Looking at the various fee categories, asset management revenue, which includes earnings from our equity investment in BlackRock was up $23 million or 6% linked quarter; year-over-year, asset management revenue increased by $17 million or 4%. Both comparisons benefited from higher equity markets and client activity.","Consumer services fees were down slightly linked quarter, as credit card fee growth was offset by lower merchant services and debit card. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, consumer services fees were up $9 million or 3% due to growth in credit card, debit card and brokerage fees. Within that, higher credit card fees were partially offset by increased year-over-year rewards activity. Corporate services fees decreased by $63 million or 15%, following a record second quarter, which was driven by elevated loan syndication and Harris Williams revenue. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, corporate services fees were down $18 million or 5%, primarily due to lower merger and acquisition advisory fees.","Third quarter residential mortgage non-interest income remained flat linked quarter as increased production revenue was offset by lower net hedging gains on mortgage servicing rights. The year-over-year comparison decreased $56 million or 35% due to both lower loan sales revenue and lower net hedging gains on mortgage servicing rights. Service charges on deposits increased by $11 million or 6% linked quarter and $7 million or 4% compared to the third quarter of last year. Growth in both periods correlated with increased customer activity. Other non-interest income increased $10 million linked quarter or 3% and included higher gains on asset sales, partially offset by lower net securities gains. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, other non-interest income increased by $87 million or 34% and included higher revenue from private equity investments. We expect other non-interest in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million.","Turning to slide eight. Expenses continue to be well-managed, due in large part to our continuous improvement program. Through the first three quarters of the year, we are on track and confident we will achieve our annual target of $350 million in expense savings, which as you know, have helped find our technology and business investments. Importantly, our efficiency ratio declined to 60% in the third quarter. On a linked quarter basis, our expenses decreased by $23 million or 1% as higher personnel costs were more than offset by lower equipment and marketing expense as well as the benefit of our continued focus on expense management.","Personnel expense increased primarily due to higher headcount related to business growth and an additional day in the quarter. Compared to the third quarter last year, expenses increased by $62 million or 3%. This reflects investments in technology and our business initiatives. Additionally, our expenses reflected the impact of operating costs associated with the ECN acquisition which closed in April of this year.","Turning to slide nine. Overall credit quality remained benign in the third quarter. Total non-performing loans were down $84 million or 4% linked quarter and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies however were up $93 million or 7%. Although this is primarily due to early -- or I\u2019m sorry, due to higher early stage consumer delinquencies in hurricane affected states.","Provision for credit losses was $130 million in the third quarter. As I mentioned, the increase included $10 million related to hurricanes Harvey and Irma. It also reflected loan growth and seasonal credit performance within the consumer loan categories. Net charge-off decreased $4 million to $106 million in the third quarter and the annualized net charge-off ratio was 19 basis points, down 1 basis-point linked quarter.","In summary, PNC posted a successful third quarter driven by growth in loans, deposits and revenue, along with well-managed expenses. For the remainder of the year, we expect continued steady growth in GDP and a 25 basis-point increase in short-term interest rates in December.","As you can see on slide 10, looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2017 reported results, we expect modest growth in loans; we expect net interest income, fee income and expenses to each be up in the low single digits; and finally, we expect provision to be between $100 million and a $150 million.","And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.","Bryan Gill","Operator, could you please poll for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead. ","John Pancari","Good morning.","Rob Reilly ","Hey, good morning, John.","John Pancari","Just regarding the CIP program, wanted to see if you can give a little bit of color there in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about 2018. I know you\u2019re confident in the 350 for 2017. How should we think about the likelihood of a new program in 2018 and the magnitude of the efficiency that you can get off of that? Thanks.","Rob Reilly","Yes, sure. John, this is Rob. Well, we\u2019re going to refrain on this call, and I will just state this upfront, from 2018 guidance. So that\u2019s just for the future people in the line there. The continuous improvement program obviously has worked well for us. It\u2019s been in place for several years. It\u2019s a mechanism that we use to hold expenses in check, particularly those expenses that are targeted towards investments and technology and business growth. So, we have just started our budgeting process for 2018. We\u2019re far from complete. My sense is, we will continue to use the tool but I don\u2019t have a number for you this morning for 2018.","John Pancari","Okay. All right, thanks Rob. And then separately, just on the loan growth side. Just wanted to get an idea, if you could help size up the new market initiative, how much in loan balances do you have in these newer markets right now? And how much of the loan growth that you saw in the quarter, came from this expansion into some of the corporate relationships in these newer markets?","Rob Reilly","Yes. Again, this is Rob, John. The new markets unquestionably, what we call our underpenetrated markets are contributing at a greater rate than our legacy markets. The balances themselves are pretty small as an overall percentage, but the growth rates in those southeast markets and we include in those underpenetrated markets Chicago as well, are running at about two times the legacy growth rates. So, they\u2019re big part of our loan growth story in the commercial side.","Operator","Thank you very much. We\u2019ll get to our question on the line from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Hey. I\u2019ll kick off with my typical question and then a follow-up. But the typical question is excess liquidity. You\u2019ve got a decent amount; I know that rates were not that attractive this quarter. And so, you\u2019re kind of -- I don\u2019t know, hoarding a little bit on the cash side. Could you give us a sense as to what kind of rates curve, shape you\u2019re looking for? And how you think about the fed balance sheet normalization? I know it\u2019s not going to impact your deposits too much, but how you\u2019re thinking about whether or not that gives you opportunities on the reinvestment side?","Bill Demchak","Start Rob. There is a lot of questions\u2026","Rob Reilly","Okay. I can handle hoarding part. I don\u2019t know if much has changed. I mean, as you saw in the third quarter there, the yield curve flattened out a bit, more than we would have liked, which in essence had us dial back a bit in terms of how we deployed into investment securities. It\u2019s improved somewhat off of those levels. So, we\u2019ve begun some more purchases than we had then. But, I don\u2019t know, when we look forward, Bill, the yield curve is pretty flat, so we don\u2019t see anything dramatically changing there.","Bill Demchak","Yes. I think the issue of the Fed unwinding its balance sheet, we\u2019re going to -- we, like everybody else, are in the sort of wait and see as it relates to the impact that ultimately has on rates. We expect them to drift higher but how much and how fast is up in the air. And that\u2019s going to be impacted as well by the choice of the Fed chairman ultimately. And we\u2019ll react to that. I mean we\u2019ve said this for years, but we -- within what has been effectively a range bound term rate in the market, we\u2019ve been pretty good at sort of getting in and getting out at the margin and deploying cash when it makes sense. In the third quarter, the yield that we actually reinvested at because we did reinvest, we just -- we didn\u2019t reinvest everything that was running up, the yield was actually below the average book yield on that remaining securities book. So, we would hope that we had at one point crossed that line and then rallied through that and we hope to get back to that at some point.","Betsy Graseck","And then, how you\u2019re thinking about the loan-to-deposit ratio? I think you\u2019re currently running at about 85%. I know it\u2019s a new world with the LCR and everything, so it\u2019s hard to use history as a guide. Just want to understand how you\u2019re thinking about managing the loan growth, the deposits and how you\u2019re thinking about the deposit betas and competing there?","Bill Demchak","I think, it\u2019s interesting. Loan-to-deposit in some ways ends up being a byproduct these days to compliance with the LCR. So, it almost is an outcome and not directly relevant, depending on how many of our deposits come from corporate deposits which are less impactful to the LCR. We purposely got ahead of LCR compliance going back more than a year, thinking it would be easier to do it when rates were low than in the rising rate environment, and that has proven to be true. As we see rates go up and other people move towards compliance, at the same time as the Fed taking cash out, we are starting to see at the margin, pretty competitive pricing on the retail side. We haven\u2019t had to react to that yet. We will continue to watch and see if we do so. But right now, what we focus on is making sure we stay in compliance with LCR, which we are and that loan-to-deposit will end up being sort of an outcome from that as much as anything else.","Rob Reilly","And just to extend on that, Betsy, around the betas. We see a continuation of what we talked about in July on the second quarter call, following the June rate hike, more activity on the commercial side and the beginning of activity on the consumer side, although it\u2019s still very low.","Operator","Thank you very much. We will go to our next question on the line from Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Yes, hi. Good morning. Just a question on some of the loan trends this quarter. On both on average and spot basis, your loan growth was best-in-class. I am wondering, under the financial services category, I understand that some of that growth has been for warehouse financing for CRE. And I am wondering is that level of growth in that category is sustainable, is there a seasonality that we should think about going forward?","Bill Demchak","It bounces around. I guess what I would say on loan growth and I\u2019ve kind of put this in my opening comments is, we continue across the board to win clients and do new deals, and it becomes harder to predict into which buckets we\u2019re going to see growth. So, this quarter, we did see growth in the CRE warehouse line, but we also saw in asset based lending which had been down in the second quarter, we saw some of it in utilization, we saw middle market continue to grow, and we saw pretty big increases in equipment finance, but it bounces around. So, we\u2019ve put kind of low guidance on loan growth and get comfortable with the notion that if we just keep growing clients, it will show up, albeit kind of across the categories, so without a real clear ability to predict which ones.","Rob Reilly","Yes, Erika, and I can add to that. On the financial services category, it does represent the warehouse lending. But in addition to that, it includes asset-backed transactions which were substantial in the third quarter. So, even though they are extended and used by companies outside of financial services, the structure requires a categorization in financial services.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And my follow-up question is, Bill, since after the crisis, PNC has been known to manage exposures very well and not grow for the sake of growth. And I am wondering, and you\u2019re also one of the few regional bank CEOs that have been talking about the Fed balance sheet reduction. There has been a lot of discussion on the impact of deposits. But I am wondering if you could give us a sense on how you are anticipating the impact to commercial real estate. If we do get some steepness to the curve, how you think that would impact first growth and then credit?","Bill Demchak","Yes. So, let\u2019s accept out what the impact that the Fed balance sheet would have and just look at rising rates. Rising rates to the real estate market are troublesome. They impact cap rates, they -- if -- as rates go up in the front end, since most of the borrowings on the projects are floating rate, you expose coverage ratios in those loans. Now, a lot of real estate developers use interest rate caps and other things to manage that exposure, some don\u2019t. So, at the margin, I would expect higher rates are going to cause greater delinquencies in real estate, and it\u2019s one of the reasons we have at the margin, dialed back our growth. I would tell you today, our real estate book has never looked better. I think, just looking to stats, Robert, delinquencies and non-performers kind of\u2026","Rob Reilly","All of this. Typically growth has slowed; commercial real estate growth has slowed, reflecting some of that.","Operator","We\u2019ll get to our next question on the line from Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill Partners. Please go ahead.","Scott Siefers","I was hoping that you could for a second, just talking about the lower corporate service line, I mean I definitely get that you come off the record 2Q, but it\u2019s just become a little uncharacteristic for you guys to have any year-over-year decline in that line item. So, just curious, if you can impart any more color and sort of how we should be thinking about it?","Rob Reilly","We feel very good about that line. The second quarter was particularly high in two categories, which the combination effect made it a significant high point. So, loan syndications and Harris Williams. Within that, treasury management and our other capital markets are all doing well. So from the quarter-over-quarter, there was a bit of decline just because of second quarter was so good in both of those categories. So, we feel very good.","Bill Demchak","Yes. I think importantly if you track that line just through time, recognizing that it\u2019ll be volatile, we continued to gain share and grow the underlying businesses. But it does bump around quarter-to-quarter.","Rob Reilly","And importantly, as part of our guidance, we expect future growth.","Scott Siefers","And then, maybe you could spend just a quick second on even if it\u2019s just qualitative commentary on provision and just slightly higher guide, there is obvious normalization and then you guys are seeing pretty study loan growth. But just curious in your mind, what is it at sort of -- where we are in the cycle causes the need for a higher provision despite no real actual deterioration in credit trends?","Rob Reilly","Yes. This is Rob, Scott. So, a couple of things there and mostly in terms of just sort of the high level. You\u2019re right on, it\u2019s the gradual normalization that we\u2019ve expected for some time off of really, really low levels. So, in this quarter, obviously on the top, it\u2019s the Hurricane, QFR that aside, we did have growth and in this quarter, the growth tended to be more in the secured transactions within corporate banking which carry a higher provision. And then, we had some seasonality on the consumer side. So, no big changes, I would say, most of it for the quarter and in our guidance reflects the gradual normalization that we\u2019ve been talking about for some time. ","Operator","We\u2019ll get to our next question on the line, from the line of John McDonald from Bernstein. Please go ahead.","John McDonald","I was wondering if you could just give us an update where you stand on the home lending, transformation and also on some of the other consumer lending initiatives.","Rob Reilly","John, good morning, it\u2019s Rob. On the home lending, that\u2019s a big work set for us and we continue to do a lot of work in that regard and we are making progress. Although, the results that you\u2019re most interested in are probably a late-stage 2018 kind of occurrence. But we are making progress in terms of combining our mortgage operations with our home equity operations. Here in the fall, soon we\u2019ll be able to do mortgage originations off our new platform. Next spring, we\u2019ll be able to do servicing on both home equity and mortgage and then later in the year originations on the home equity. So, we\u2019re making progress. We have a lot of confidence and conviction it\u2019s the right thing to do. It\u2019s just a lot of hard work and it takes time.","Bill Demchak","The other thing I would just say on the consumer lending transformation broadly defined, we\u2019re making really good progress on sort of the -- build digital delivery of those products or some of that will show up with mortgage and home equity, other parts with card and auto as we bring some things in the mobile. We\u2019re making progress and you see it in some of our volumes on our sort of policies and procedures as it relates to things we should have been doing based on our credit appetite that we just weren\u2019t. And where we probably underestimated the work set is the work that needs to go on inside of the core servicing and the automation of some of the new regulatory compliance that is frankly slowing down fulfillments inside the consumer space. So, we\u2019re making progress on everything as we kind of dig on to the covers on the core operations and think about what it takes to use automation inside of that space, probably a little bit harder than we had assumed.","John McDonald","And Bill, maybe a little more color similarly on your tech investments and the kind of platform transformation. I think back office wise, I think you shift to data centers is complete this year. How should we think about your kind of trajectory of tech investments and transforming the customer experience as well as the back office?","Bill Demchak","We\u2019re shifting the spend to customer experience, to employee-enablement, part of that is what will happen inside of the servicing platforms. We actually have -- it\u2019s interesting in our budgeting exercises and Rob can talk about this, we always show tech spend going down and I always plug it to say that it\u2019s going to at least stay and\/or go up simply because I just think that it is going to accelerate into what will be a digital based financial services network and we have to be part of that. Now, we\u2019ll talk about 2018 when we get to 2018 but my best guess is we\u2019ll simply shift the dollar spend and put more and more on the client acquisition and servicing side versus building a core infrastructure which now allows that to be...","Rob Reilly","It\u2019s the foundation.","John McDonald","Got it. And then one quick follow-up, Rob, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve got this earlier on deposit betas. Just on the retail side, have you guys seen anything in terms of deposit beta just on retail banking and if you could just comment on the wealth management side as well?","Rob Reilly","Beta for\u2026","John McDonald","Yes, exactly, the deposit beta\u2026","Rob Reilly","Yes. We did at the front of the call, John. So, following the June rate hike where consumer beta had been zero, we are seeing some activity and some pick-up but still very, very low. It is our expectation that they\u2019ll continue to rise, we\u2019ll just have to see at what pace. But our folks feel and we\u2019ve said this for most of year that it\u2019s probably another rate hike or two before they totally normalize.","John McDonald","Got it.","Rob Reilly","Still low.","John McDonald","And wealth management, we\u2019ve seen some other banks kind of pushing up there\u2026","Rob Reilly","No, it\u2019s fairly consistent there. Our wealth book in terms of our deposits is about $12 billion. So, it\u2019s relatively small and it\u2019s married basically to consumer behavior, maybe a little bit more.","Operator","Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll get to our next question on the line, Mr. Kevin Barker from Piper Jaffray. Please go right ahead.","Kevin Barker","Good morning. In regards to your auto loan growth, you guys have been outpacing most peers the past few quarters, despite what we\u2019ve seen is a decline in overall new car sales and auto originations. You\u2019ve obviously pulled back in 2014 and 2015 as the industry was getting very heated, remained in the space. Could you just talk about the state of the auto industry and what your expectations are for loan growth going forward?","Bill Demchak","I think, I mean we ought to just step back to the basic comment that we really haven\u2019t changed what we\u2019ve been all along. At one point, that allowed us to do greater volume, both because we were lending when some others weren\u2019t, and also because that the industry itself was producing greater volume. What\u2019s happened of course is we keep our boxes same, and more and more products goes to leasing or longer tenure or more loan-to-value, we\u2019ve had less share and less growth. As we expand our markets and into the newer markets, we have this opportunity to take share, simply because we\u2019re entering new markets, notwithstanding the fact that the total size of the market is declining. The other thing that\u2019s happening is we move more -- if you look at our growth rates in direct versus indirect and the products we\u2019re rolling out on mobile Check Ready which we\u2019re going to enhance with some other features in the coming months, we\u2019re moving the way people borrow money from us to buy a car. And my suspicion is that that will likely accelerate, even as the total lending volume and the industry stabilizes are false, accelerate for us and others is more of this moves direct and more on the mobile.","Rob Reilly","And the attractiveness of the product to the consumer.","Bill Demchak","Yes, it\u2019s very easy.","Rob Reilly","And add to that just in terms of our auto book, which is roughly $12.5 billion in outstandings, we feel good about the credit quality, where a prime book average FICO is 730 and originations actually this quarter were above that, more -- approximately like 750; tenures are 70 months; loan-to-values 90% and we\u2019re not in the leasing business. So, we feel good about our credit quality of the book.","Kevin Barker","Okay. And then, follow-up on some -- on the commercial real estate. You\u2019ve seen quite a bit of increase in your asset yields in commercial real estate, up almost 40 basis points over the last year. Could you talk about the shift in your book and where new money yields are\u2026","Bill Demchak","I don\u2019t think I think all you\u2019re seeing is the pull through of rising chart rates. So, there hasn\u2019t really been a shift in our book at all. I mean, at the margin, we\u2019ve seen growth in the term product that kind of comes on as a fixed rate. But most of that is what you\u2019re seeing is just a run up in LIBOR and the underlying spreads has been -- if anything creeping out at the margin in real estate but our new volume has been such that that has an impact in the overall market just because our volumes -- I think zero percent year-on-year. ","Rob Reilly","Yes. And that\u2019s true just for commercial yields in general beyond commercial real estate, it\u2019s rate driven.","Operator","Thank you very much. We\u2019ll get to our next question on the line from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go right ahead.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Follow-up on the balance sheet. You guys talked about kind of restarting little purchasing on the securities and obviously you\u2019ve had good loan growth, which has been matched nicely by the deposit growth. As we go forward, and I know you\u2019ve talked about this a little bit, again, I just wanted to get your updated thoughts. Do you anticipate seeing mix shift on the balance sheet as we look ahead and effects from Fed normalization? And are the deposits you\u2019re getting still just coming from new customers or you\u2019re still getting more money from existing customers? Thanks, guys.","Rob Reilly","Well, I don\u2019t where to jump in on that. I don\u2019t see any -- on the Fed unwind, Bill said it well, we\u2019ll see. This is new and we will see what the ramifications are. So setting that aside, I don\u2019t see a big balance sheet shift. I do see some intensifying around deposit relative to the betas on the pricing. So, I do think that that will intensify, but I don\u2019t see anything dramatically shifting. Bill?","Bill Demchak","Yes, I don\u2019t think so. Look at, in a perfect world, we would use more of our liquidity for loan growth that fits within our credit capacity. We continue to grow but not at the pace that we\u2019re generating liquidity. We have that liquidity to deploy, much of it would be pointed towards sort of level one securities if and when yields get to a place where they make sense to us. Today we continue to run the balance sheet very short as it relates to interest rates that service well, we\u2019ll continue to do that. And so, we accelerate into -- hopefully accelerate into higher rates as the Fed one unwinds its balance sheet.","Ken Usdin","Yes, and let me -- I can qualify my second question more. I was more thinking about, are you seeing mix shift, meaning are you seeing customers come out of non-interest bearing into interest bearing? I know we are seeing that into betas. But\u2026","Bill Demchak","Yes.","Ken Usdin","Growing your commercial customers and I am more wondering just about where the incremental deposit is going as far as the deposit mix? That\u2019s really what I meant to get at.","Bill Demchak","Yes. So, obviously, very different on the corporate side versus the consumer side. The corporate side, there continues to be a bit of differentiation between the larger corporates who are frankly shopping rates a little bit more, and that\u2019s a product that has effectively had a beta of 1 since the beginning. Some of our more active treasury management clients who use balances to offset fees are a little bit less sensitive to that. On the consumer side, at the margin, we\u2019ve seen growth in our interest bearing through time as people see that hey there\u2019s money on the table to....","Rob Reilly","This has been a case for a while.","Bill Demchak","Yes.","Rob Reilly","No big shift.","Ken Usdin","Yes. And Bill, last little one. On the earnings credit rate, are we seeing any of that inside the treasury management business, are you starting to get back some more there at all?","Bill Demchak","It\u2019s a much lower beta than what a straight corporate deposit would demand, which continues to be for hot money that corporates kind of shop around the banks, it\u2019s our primary competition or the treasury base, government base money market fronts, and we\u2019re basically priced right on top of that moving with it. Less impact on the compensating balances.","Operator","Thank you very much. We do have one more question queued up on the line from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Go right ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Rob, you mentioned about the more rapid growth you are seeing in some of your newer territories that you\u2019ve gone into de novo like Chicago on the commercial loan side. Can you share with us how you are achieving -- I know you\u2019re coming off a low base, but how are you achieving that faster loan growth in these new territories?","Bill Demchak","It\u2019s Bill, Gerard. Think about it, we got in there bunch of years ago and we planted a bunch of seeds. We hired very good employees, we called on the right clients and we called on them for what is now three and four years. And after you do that, you eventually get a shot on goal as something comes up for renewal. There\u2019s been disruption in the market that we\u2019ve taken advantage of and we\u2019re just getting\u2026","Rob Reilly","And we\u2019re doing what we do in these new markets now year five. So, it\u2019s just reflecting a lot of efforts, to Bill\u2019s points that were made years ago. I should mention too as the earlier question, we are up and running in Dallas, Kansas City and Minneapolis, but that\u2019s early. The energy is high, the progress is real. So, we\u2019re excited about it. But there is just in terms of vintage, a little early to conclude anything.","Bill Demchak","Think about it, you go into a market, this isn\u2019t you just show up, they don\u2019t put an RFP out for a new loan and you show up some bids on new loan. We\u2019ve been calling on it for years and something gets renewed, we maybe are already a participant, they bring us in to see how we might do it and we displace the left lead on this indication take a bigger hold and have a bigger share of what we do with that client. And that -- we\u2019re good at that. That\u2019s what we do, but it takes a lot of years. It\u2019s not something you just show up and do. Because, when you show up, all you can do is kind of participate on somebody else\u2019s credit. That\u2019s not so much our gain. ","Rob Reilly","And requires the patience, as you talk about...","Gerard Cassidy","Right. And without naming names, do you guys find when you have these successes, you\u2019re taking the business away from middle market type banks or are these very large universal type banks where you seem to be getting these customers from?","Bill Demchak","It\u2019s all the above. But I would say that we have seen an acceleration in what we are getting from some of the larger banks.","Gerard Cassidy","And Bill just as a comment on, obviously the treasury has come out with these white papers on how they want to change the regulatory outlook for the banks. When you get your chance to sit down with the new Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve for example, what are the topics that are important to you, for PNC that you like to see address and get some relief?","Bill Demchak","LCR, LCR and LCR. I think it is simplest form. Regulation looked at a risk-based or activities-based model as opposed to an asset threshold model, in terms of the way they apply all regulations. I think we\u2019d be in a better place. Our business model is much more similar to the people smaller than us than is to the people who are four times our size; we tend to get caught in that bucket. So, inside of that, relief on LCR, at the margin some stuff that they do in Volcker, some of the activities around stress test and other things. By and large, I think the treasury papers and suggestions or actually, the one at capital markets are less equity relevant to us. But the first one, I think it was pretty on point, we agree with most stuff in there.","Operator","Thank you very much. And we have no further questions on the phone lines.","Bryan Gill","Okay.

My name is Charlene, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PNC Financial Services Group Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bill Callihan. Sir, please go ahead.","William H. Callihan","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Rohr; and Rick Johnson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Actual results and future events could differ possibly materially from those anticipated in our statements and from our historical performance due to a variety of risks and other factors. Our forward-looking statements regarding PNC's performance assume a condition of the current economic environment and do not take into account the impact of potential legal and regulatory contingencies. Information about such factors, as well as GAAP reconciliations and other information on non-GAAP financial measures we discuss, is included in today's conference call, earnings release and related presentation materials and in our 10-K, 10-Qs and various other SEC filings and investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under the Investor Relations section. These statements speak only as of January 17, 2013, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim Rohr.","James E. Rohr","Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As we began 2012, we knew the year would provide our industry with some significant challenges. We were faced with slow economic growth and historically low interest rates, along with a dynamic regulatory environment.","I'm pleased, but certainly not entirely satisfied, as there were clearly some pluses and minuses in our year. On the plus side, 2012 provided PNC with some of the highest levels of customer growth we've ever seen, both through organic gains and economic acquisitions. We added customers across our businesses, creating opportunities to deepen relationships and further increase our revenue.","By increasing customers, we were able to grow loans and deposits. Full year loans increased $27 billion or 17%, and fourth quarter loan growth was $4 billion or 2%. Similarly, full year deposits grew by $25 billion or 13%, and fourth quarter deposits were up $6.8 billion or 3% on a linked-quarter basis.","Thirdly, we expanded our presence in the Southeast in the first quarter of 2012 with the successful acquisition and integration of RBC Bank (USA). With this transaction, we added nearly 1 million accounts and gained access to some of the fastest-growing markets in the U.S. Overall, credit metrics improved on a year-over-year basis, but clearly, those trends are slowing but continuing.","Our balance sheet remained highly liquid and core funded with an 87% loan-to-deposit ratio. Our Tier 1 common capital ratio was estimated to be 9.6% as of December 31, and our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio on a pro forma basis as of that date was estimated to be 7.3%. Of course, that's based on our current understandings of the Basel rules and other estimates. However, there were minuses as well, some of which were highlighted in our recent 8-K filing. Residential Mortgage repurchase provision, primarily related to the loans which were acquired from National City, totaled $760 million for the year and had a significant impact on revenue.","On the expense side, Residential Mortgage foreclosure-related expenses were $225 million for the year. We're pleased that we resolved the foreclosure look-back issue with our regulators. Other expense impacts of 2012 included nearly $300 million of noncash charges related to redeeming a total of $2.3 billion in trust preferred securities that had a weighted average rate of more than 8.3%. On the upside, redeeming these securities is lowering our funding costs. And full year integration costs, related to RBC primarily, were more than $260 million. On balance, this was a good year for PNC. But because of these minuses, especially those related to Residential Mortgage, our results did not fully reflect the investments we've made and the potential we believe PNC can create for our shareholders.","As we look forward to 2013, I should add that we expect no additional integration charges, substantially lower trust preferred securities redemption charges and mortgage -- lower, also, mortgage foreclosure-related compliance expenses. I also expect -- continue to expect modest economic growth at the sustained low interest rate environment. But in this environment, our goal is to continue to leverage the growth we've seen in customer relationships to increase revenue while also reducing expenses. And we'll get into that in some detail.","Now we talk about customer growth because we believe that customers are the foundation of revenue potential. Our innovative product set, coupled with our go-to-market strategy and strong brands, have helped us increase the number of customers we see or serve as you can see on Slide 4.","In Retail Banking, our focus is on improving the profitability of our checking relationships, serving them efficiently, which is critically important in today's economic environment, and we continue to deepen our relationships with those customers through cross-selling. We added 254,000 net new organic checking relationships during the year. Checking relationships grew organically in 2012 by 4% from year-end 2011 or more than double the population growth in our footprint.","We also acquired 460,000 checking account relationships through our acquisition of RBC Bank (USA) in the first quarter of this year, bringing our total checking relationships to approximately 6.5 million at year end. These relationships provide us with significant deposits in the current low interest rate environment. Now these aren't as valuable as they were in higher rates, but they still provide us with a stable source of liquidity along with low-cost funding that supports lending activities across our businesses.","For the full year, 65% of our new checking accounts were relationship-priced account, as more customers are seeing the value of having a deeper relationship with us as opposed to just having a free checking account.","In Corporate & Institutional Banking, we continue to build client relationships and added more than 1,000 new primary clients in Corporate Banking during the year, and we remain focused on earning appropriate risk-adjusted returns from these relationships. We also added another 282 clients in business credit and commercial real estate. New clients in corporate bank continued strong growth in public finance, health care, commercial real estate and our asset base groups, which helped us drive strong loan growth in C&IB during the year. We're also deepening our relationships with these clients and adding fee-based products and services. Full year treasury management revenue increased by 9% over last year, and capital markets revenue was up 14% during the same period.","New primary client acquisitions in our Asset Management Group were 37% higher in 2012 compared to 2011. Referral sales for the first 12 months were up more than 39% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting strong referral activity from Retail and Corporate & Institutional Banking. This client activity, along with the improved performance of the equity markets, helped assets under administration increase to $224 billion as of December 31, a 7% increase from the same time a year ago. AMG's fee income for the year was up 4% compared to 2011.","Now we saw a strong loan production in the Residential Mortgage area. Originations were up 33%, and spreads were up 48% for all of 2012 compared to the previous year, primarily driven by refinancing and HARP activity. We continue to make strides to enhance our purchase originations. As refinancing activity decreases, this will drive longer-term value for the business.","BlackRock recorded earnings this morning and had a good fourth quarter and a good year. Overall, we believe this level of client growth will lead to increased revenue next year. At the same time, we're looking to make significant expense reductions with our goal of achieving full year positive operating leverage.","Now Rick will provide you with more detail on our fourth quarter results.","Richard J. Johnson","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter net income was $719 million or $1.24 per diluted common share. As you're well aware, we announced several items impacting these results in our recent 8-K filing. Taken together, these items resulted in a reduction of earnings per diluted common share of $0.47. After adjusting for these items, our return on average assets would have been 1.28%.","Now let me provide you with a few highlights of our fourth quarter results. We saw linked-quarter loan growth of $4 billion, primarily due to gains in several categories of commercial lending and automobile lend. This helped support a modest increase in net interest income.","On the fee side, excluding the impact of the Residential Mortgage repurchase provision, noninterest income on an adjusted basis grew by $173 million or 10%. As a result, fourth quarter total revenue increased on an adjusted basis by $198 million or 5% compared to the third quarter. Our provision was elevated compared to the third quarter, primarily due to a larger loan portfolio and a reduced reserve release in Commercial Banking.","Expenses were higher at linked quarter, primarily as a result of Residential Mortgage-related charges, contributions to the PNC Foundation and adjustments to accruals primarily for deferred loan origination expenses. Finally, we ended the year with strong capital ratios and strong liquidity.","Let me take a moment to discuss the impact of loan growth on our net interest income. As you can see on Slide 6, average interest earning assets increased $1 billion on a linked-quarter basis due to average loan growth of $2.5 billion or 1%. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, average interest earning assets were up $25 billion or 11% as a result of a $27 billion or 17% increase in average loans.","Commercial loan growth was the primary driver of our increase in total loans. Commercial loans on a spot basis increased $3.7 billion or 4% linked quarter due to gains in asset-based lending, health care, public finance and real estate. For the full year, commercial loans were up by $20.6 billion or 23%.","On the consumer side, we saw loan growth of $300 million in the fourth quarter compared to third quarter results. On a full year basis, consumer loans were up $6.3 billion or 9%. For both periods, the primary driver was higher automobile lending. Comparing the fourth quarter to the third, net interest income increased by 1% as a result of a stable core net interest income and better-than-expected cash recoveries primarily on commercial loans.","Looking to the first quarter of 2013, we are expecting a 2% to 3% decline in net interest income compared to the fourth quarter due to a decrease in purchase accounting accretion of up to $50 million to $60 million, including lower expected cash recoveries. As we've said before, we expect purchase accounting accretion to decline by $400 million for the full year of 2013 versus 2012, while core net interest income is expected to increase.","As you can see on Slide 7, fourth quarter noninterest income reflected good performances in several fee categories. However, overall results were affected by a higher provision for Residential Mortgage repurchases, which I will comment on later.","Excluding the impact of the mortgage repurchase provision from both periods, fees would have been up by $173 million or 10% linked quarter. Consumer service fees increased by $6 million or 2% linked quarter due to customer growth partially offset by the impact of Hurricane Sandy on customer volume and activity.","Corporate service fees were up $54 million or 18% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily due to strong merger and acquisition advisory fees and higher loan syndications. Deposit service charges were down $2 million compared to the third quarter, reflecting fees waived related to Hurricane Sandy of $7 million. Other fee income increased by $114 million, primarily due to higher revenue associated with commercial mortgage banking activity and private equity investments and asset sales.","In the third quarter, we sold 5 million of our Visa common shares resulting in a pretax gain of $137 million. In the fourth quarter, we sold 4 million of our Visa shares for a pretax gain of $130 million. We continue to hold approximately 14 million shares of Visa Class B common stock with an estimated fair value of approximately $900 million as of December 31, 2012. These shares are recorded on our books at 250 million, resulting in an unrecognized value of approximately $650 million pretax.","As you can see at the bottom of the chart, the percentage of fee income to total revenue is moving from the high 30s to the low 40s. At the same time, we've been growing net interest income. As we continue to cross-sell in our new markets, we expect to see this percentage increase as we deepen our relationships with the growing number of customers we serve. In 2013, we expect noninterest income to increase and total reported revenue to increase compared to 2012.","Turning to Residential Mortgage repurchase obligations on Slide 8. We recently received additional Residential Mortgage file requests from both GSEs, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. The majority of the increase was from the '04 to '05 vintage of loans that were sold into agency securitizations.","In the fourth quarter, we recorded a Residential Mortgage repurchase provision of $254 million. This reflects expected elevated levels of demands related to discussions with both GSEs, our future expectations for GSE harmonization of demands and the new originations in the fourth quarter. This additional provision bought the reserve for residential mortgage repurchase claims reflected on our balance sheet to approximately $614 million as of December 31, 2012. This brings our coverage for expected lifetime losses on our total portfolio to $2 billion. We believe our reserves are consistent with our peers, and if the industry has further demands, PNC will as well.","Turning to Slide 9. Expenses in the fourth quarter increased by $179 million compared to the third quarter, primarily as a result of Residential Mortgage foreclosure-related charges of approximately $91 million versus $53 million last quarter and a $45 million goodwill impairment charge related to the Residential Mortgage business segment. In addition, we added $28 million contribution to the PNC Foundation and a $38 million charge as we adjusted accruals primarily related to deferred loan origination costs.","As we look to the first quarter of 2013, I expect a significant reduction in the clients-related mortgage foreclosure charges and do not anticipate charges for goodwill impairment, integration costs, trust preferred securities redemptions, foundation contributions or deferred loan origination costs accrual adjustments. As a result, I expect first quarter expenses to decrease by approximately $300 million or 11% compared to our fourth quarter of 2012.","For 2013, we have increased our continuous improvement goal to $700 million, which represents 7% of our 2012 expense base and includes the expected decline in mortgage foreclosure compliance costs. That amount will be offset by investments in our businesses and our infrastructure, including the full year cost of the RBC acquisition. However, we are not expecting integration charges in 2013, and we believe the charges for any trust preferred securities redemptions in 2013 should be $16 million or less. Those 2 items totaled $562 million in 2012. As a result, I expect reported expenses to decline by mid-single digits on a percentage basis, while I expect core expenses, which exclude integration and trust preferred security redemption charges, to be flat in 2013 versus 2012.","Regarding income taxes, we would expect our 2013 full year effective tax rate to be between 25% and 26%. Overall, credit quality continue to improve in the fourth quarter. Criticized commercial loans, nonperforming loans and delinquencies all decreased on a linked-quarter basis.","Our provision for the fourth quarter of $318 million was higher than the previous guidance of $150 million to $250 million, primarily due to the completion of our implementation of regulatory guidance for loans discharged from bankruptcy. A provision of $53 million was recorded in the fourth quarter related to this guidance.","Charge-offs in the fourth quarter were $310 million, down $20 million -- $21 million linked quarter. This includes $45 million in the fourth quarter compared to $83 million in the third quarter, as we completed our work related to loans discharged from bankruptcy.","Looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect the provision to be between $200 million and $300 million. This is slightly higher than last year's quarterly guidance, as we expect the benefit of commercial loan reserve releases to be lower in 2013 versus 2012.","Turning to capital. Slide 11 reflects our capital position, as well as our Basel III goal and our capital priorities. Our Tier 1 common ratio at the end of the fourth quarter is estimated to be 9.6%. That's up 10 basis points since the end of the third quarter, primarily due to the growth in retained earnings. With regard to our Basel III Tier 1 pro forma common capital ratio, based on our current understanding of Basel II and III rules and other estimates, our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio on a pro forma basis was estimated to be 7.3% as of December 31, 2012. It remains our goal to be within the range of 8% to 8.5% by the end of 2013 without benefit of phase-ins. We believe we can get there primarily based on increased retained earnings in 2013. Overall, this quarter provided PNC with a good foundation for future growth.","And with that, I'll hand it back to Jim.","James E. Rohr","Thanks, Rick. Overall, 2012 provided PNC with a tremendous opportunity to grow our businesses. Interest rates won't always be this low, and we believe there's never been a better time to invest in growing the number of customers we serve.","Our plans for 2013 are focused on revenue growth, with an emphasis on deepening customer relationships and increasing fee income while reducing expenses. Our goal in 2013 is to deliver positive operating leverage. To the extent that we don't achieve revenue growth that outpace our expenses, we will take further actions to reduce expenses, which should improve 2013 results and importantly, create momentum going into 2014.","Given those expectations, we currently believe that we'll be in the range of the first call estimates for 2013, that assumes the economic outlook for the year will be a continuation of the current environment. Of course, if we get a little help in the form of a fast economic growth or higher interest rates, our results would be even better.","And with that, we look forward to your questions. Operator, if you could give our participants the instructions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I was wondering on the loan growth number for the quarter, the $4 billion, did you see some acceleration later in the quarter? And also, in the commercial side, any improvement in the utilization there?","Richard J. Johnson","Yes, no improvement in utilization, John, but what we did see is certainly a lot of growth towards the tail end of the quarter, and you can see that because the average didn't go up as much. So we should be -- see a pretty good lift in the average loans going into the first quarter.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And any other color sectors or areas that were driving that improvement?","James E. Rohr","Well, I think the sectors that Rick mentioned and I have mentioned with the asset-based lending and the health care business and somewhat in the energy space.","Richard J. Johnson","Public finance and a little bit of real estate as well, across the board.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Rick, I don't know if you mentioned this, but on the mortgage put-backs with the additional provisioning you did this quarter, what kind of expectations do you have for that going forward? Do you have to just add for new originations? How are you thinking about that?","Richard J. Johnson","That's my plan, John. That's for new originations.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And how are you guys thinking -- I see the slide about the capital, and you obviously say you're about building capital. With that mindset, how are you going into thinking about the CCAR? Do you want to increase the dividend a little bit? What are your hopes for this year? And then as you look out further next year, how should we think about your philosophy on capital rate of return?","James E. Rohr","Well, we submitted our CCAR, and we're hopeful that we'll be able to return some additional capital to the shareholders this year. But we don't expect to buy back because this is a capital building year for us because the cash we spent last year in buying RBC. But we fully expect to be in the range of our goal for Basel III by the end of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question is just a clarity on the expense side. I just wanted to make sure that I got the message that you were conveying. So if we take your guidance for the first quarter, are we taking this $300 million off of the GAAP number of 2 8, 2 9 [ph]? And if so, is the message here that this year you're going to keep the core expense levels flat to that quarterly run rate of $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion? And to Jim's comment, if the revenue outlook falls short, you could dial that back.","Richard J. Johnson","You hit it perfectly.","James E. Rohr","Exactly right.","Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And on your guidance for core NII growth, if you look back over time except for one blip one quarter, your core margin is actually quite stable over the past 5 quarters, varying from the low 3.4 [ph] to the high 3.3 level. I guess, Rick, is the main message there you can continue to keep the core margin relatively stable? And if so, could you give us sort of a sense of what's happening on both sides of the balance sheet to keep it that way in this rate environment?","Richard J. Johnson","Yes, Erika, I wouldn't -- I would never give you guidance on the NIM. I don't think we can give you guidance on the NIM given the change in the mix of the book and what might happen. What's important to us is the fact that we are growing loans, and we'll continue to grow loans. And I think to the extent there is compression on the yields in the industry, we'll try to offset that to the best we can with loan growth. And as a result, that's what we feel core net interest income will continue to go up, although what happens with the calculation in NIM is going to be subject to the mix.","Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And in slide -- just to follow up on that, on Slide 4 of your presentation, you showed us your new primary client growth, and that was pretty significant in 2011. Is the main message there we're going to sort of see that come through on the revenue side either on the fees and on the loan growth side in 2013?","James E. Rohr","Yes, you're exactly right again. In this environment, as we said a year ago, in this kind of environment, we can't drive up economic growth if we can't drive up interest rates. Unfortunately, we'd like to do both. But given that they're both where they are, I think the answer is you grow clients, you deepen your relationship with clients and you manage your expenses down. And I think if you look at 2012, 2012 was a year where we grew client significantly. We had a very, very successful integration, and we obviously had charges on the mortgage side. Going into this year, we fully expect that we're going to be able to continue to drive more revenue from those customers and from new customers and to take the expenses. Now we don't expense them -- we don't expect the mortgage charges to recur the way they were in 2012. So that's exactly what we're going to do for this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies & Company.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could just also give a little bit more color on the fee side. Obviously, it's a real good strength this quarter on the mortgage side and most notably, the corporate services. In the fall, you guys were talking about and you just mentioned again, Jim, the desire and ability to grow fees. But I was wondering if you could also help us understand how do you overcome some of these tough comps in the fee growth? And what gives you the confidence that you can actually grow fees when you take out again all the charges and stuff?","James E. Rohr","Well, one of the things that we're doing, as you know, if you look at the fee income growth in the Western half of the franchise, on the C&IB side, it's growing more rapidly there than it is on the East, although it's growing in the East. We put -- we only put those products anywhere from one year to 2 years ago in terms of staffing. Obviously, in the Southeast, basically, we acquired a franchise that had de minimis fee income. It didn't have capital markets. They had a very modest treasury management business. They didn't have university banking. A lot of the things that we have, they didn't really have a purchase card. So a lot of the products that we put in right away in the Southeast are starting to take off. So I think the comment that -- the last question about how do we see revenue growth, we see revenue growth a lot on the fee side coming from these new customers and newer markets.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And could you elaborate that on -- specifically, you guys can talk about mortgage. Another great -- that was another up quarter for mortgage. Can you talk about the pipeline gain on sale? And could you -- where do you think the Mortgage Banking business trends as we look ahead?","Richard J. Johnson","We feel good about it. We see the volume continuing to increase in the new year. We think spreads are going to get a little bit tighter than where we were this year. Gains on sales spreads are about 3%. We think they'll come down a little bit. So we're actually thinking that we'll see an increase in the revenue on originations going into 2013.","James E. Rohr","We were pleased about it. If you look at the chart, that long-term revenue potential, we had a 25% increase in purchase mortgages, and that's been our focus because at some point in time, a lot of the refinance will go away. And it's the relationships that we have in the marketplace with the purchase originations will continue to carry the profitability forward. So you can see the focus in 2012 on those. And that market's coming back, so that focus should have a good reward.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Last thing for me. It's on the expense side, in the incremental couple hundred million you're finding -- incremental you're finding on the continuous improvement. Can you talk about how much further you're reaching -- and I know you made the point that if the revenues don't show, then you'll adjust again. But just can you talk about kind of how hard -- how much harder you are pushing versus how much more you still might be around underneath the surface?","Richard J. Johnson","We -- as you recall, prior, we had $500 million in there, and we've upped it to $700 million. Half of that is on the reduction in the compliance cost related to foreclosure. The other half is the finishing the budget process and identifying more opportunities. But there's certainly room to grow if we are -- room to reduce, excuse me, if we don't see the revenue show up. So we think it's a reasonable target for us, $700 million. It's more than we've done in any last couple of years, and I think it's going to help us keep expenses, core expenses flat and reported expenses down about 5%.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple things on the fee income. The commercial mortgage banking, I mean I'm assuming that's a business where I don't know how long of a pipeline you've got, but that's a business where you expect activity to remain strong at least in the short to intermediate term into 2013, right?","Richard J. Johnson","Well, that was a particularly strong quarter for us. We had about $30 million of revenue in that category for the quarter. But we'll still have good volumes next year. So I think year-over-year, it'll be a higher revenue production, but the fourth quarter was a bit higher than we typically get.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And kind of the same idea with respect to the M&A fees, is that something where you've taken market share or is it just related to transactions that were unique to fourth quarter?","Richard J. Johnson","Great finish to the year.","James E. Rohr","Great fourth quarter.","Richard J. Johnson","Yes.","James E. Rohr","It's really a middle market business, as you know.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right, right. Okay. As it relates to the commentary about fee income kind of rolling that out through the RBC franchise, is there a way that we could bound the amount? I mean they have roughly, what, about $200 million of net interest income kind of quarterly? Is that about right? I mean, so is it -- do you think it could be...","James E. Rohr","[indiscernible] anymore now that we've combined.","Richard J. Johnson","Yes. We integrated it immediately, so we really don't. The one thing we do know is it's certainly accretive, and we think about $0.40 for the year accretive. But we don't have a lot of details we're trying to track throughout. So...","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right. But I guess I'm just trying to bound what it might -- what might be a reasonable number over some 2- to 3-year period. Is it $50 million a quarter you think out of that or is it $75 million? I mean, how -- is there any way we could kind of put some parameters around that?","Richard J. Johnson","Well, I would say we're running at about $50 million a quarter right now, so I think you can see that increase from there absolutely in the deeper relationships.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Turner with Compass Point.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","On the credit quality, it seems like with the level of loan growth you're getting, the amount of potential reserve releases going forward maybe few and far between. Is that correct? And what kind of downside can we see in charge-offs? I mean, it looks like they upticked this quarter mainly due to home equity loans when I stripped out the noise from last quarter. But can we get down to 30 basis points of losses or sort of how much more upside in the loss side do you see?","Richard J. Johnson","The challenge right now is because of this implementation with the loans that have been discharged and bankruptcies, we had a couple of onetime items in the third and fourth quarter, which added $100 million in the third quarter to our nonperforming loans and added $200 million in the fourth quarter. So that's why some of our trends there are not coming down as quickly as we would like to see them happening. But all I was saying on the reserve releasing, we're still going to have commercial loan reserves releases. They just won't be as large as they were in 2012. At the moment, we're not releasing any reserves on the consumer side as we're continuing to watch the charge-offs in that space.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then also maybe if you could talk about the M&A environment versus a quarter ago, are you seeing any change in seller attitudes or increased interest or any color there would be helpful?","James E. Rohr","I think it's been relatively quiet in some small banks. I think you've been seeing selling to other small banks from mostly those some kind of a distressed sale. But we're really more focused on our -- just growing our customers in the markets that we're already in. I think there's a tremendous opportunity to do that. And so we're not spending a lot of time looking around the M&A space, but we don't see a lot of it either.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And one last one, sorry. On the mortgage banking, how much pickup are you getting incrementally from the RBC platform? I mean, are you seeing as a percentage of those originations each quarter, is that growing rapidly? Any color there would be helpful.","James E. Rohr","The mortgage company was already in the Southeast. So the addition of RBC is an enhancement to the existing distribution system. So I don't think it's a big lift at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Just a little more color on the reserve build, which stands out versus some of your peers. So how do we on the outside know if the reserve build is due to more aggressive underwriting by PNC or more conservatism by PNC?","Richard J. Johnson","Well yes, we had a couple of things, Mike. You had about $50 million that we provided in the quarter related to this bankruptcy. We had a lower impact related to releasing reserves on commercial loans of about $40 million, and we had an increase in our portfolio. So I think collectively, we've added some reserves related to those, and that's part of the reason why we have an increase this quarter of a provision and not a lot of release overall. I do expect -- Mike, I do expect that, that next year, as I said, I expect in the first quarter that the provision levels will be between $200 million and $300 million. And I expect charge-offs not to remain at this elevated level unless there's more changes on how we, provided by the regulators, on how to do our charge-off procedures.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","All right. So it's kind of a onetime year-end bump up in the provision?","Richard J. Johnson","Yes, that's correct, Mike.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then as it relates to loan growth, can you give any additional color? So loan utilization is not improving, but you're seeing growth in asset-based lending, health care, energy. Are these syndicated loans? I know you've been doing this for a long time, but some of your peers have been getting more aggressive with their pursuit of syndicated loans, sometimes, out of market. So I guess I'm asking what's the competitive landscape when you're getting this additional loan growth?","James E. Rohr","With the additional loan growth, we're not simply buying syndications. I mean, we won a number of syndications where we're the agent. But the way we manage the business, the individual relationship manager has to get the right risk adjusted return on a relationship. So if they're not getting some kind of fee income, in many cases, it's difficult to add the relationship. And so we're spending a lot of time becoming the agent bank in many cases. We're generating new relationships that has fee income associated with it rather than just buy a piece of somebody else's syndication. It doesn't work really well for us.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Jim, I think you mentioned before Ohio had been getting pretty competitive. It might have been a quarter or 2 ago. Is Ohio still very competitive or when you're negotiating these new loans, do you have to give concessions on price or what's the temperature?","James E. Rohr","There's obviously very competitive landscape. We just did a heat map for this. It's kind of funny, we run into different competitors in different markets. And Ohio is particularly competitive because of few of the banks over there. The spreads are still good, and terms have softened a little bit in terms of increased tenor by 1.5 years or something like that. We're going to try not to go out that long. But in any event, there's little more competition in Ohio. In different markets, we have different competitors that distinguish themselves from time to time. But we're being very successful in growing new customers, and a lot of it is tied to new products and because of our presence and our brand in the marketplace and the good job our folks have done. So I don't think it's a pricing issue for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","A couple of regulatory-related questions here. Jim, could you just give us some insight into how the regulators are guiding the larger banks about acquisitions? We know that they basically said to the largest banks, don't even think about doing a deal. But sort of when you go into the tier of the large regional banks, I mean, is there any sort of explicit guidance about your ability to do deals?","James E. Rohr","I read that in the newspaper a few weeks ago, and a couple people called me. And somebody called and asked if we were told not to bid on something. That's just really isn't true. We've not been looking for things to buy lately, so it's not like we've gone out to Washington with a bunch of requests. But no, I don't think that's the case. I think they're much more. Now for the really big banks, I can't -- certainly can't speak on their behalf. But I think in our case, the discussions that we have with the regulators regularly are all about getting to the capital requirements that we're focused on and making sure that we have our risks covered off and implementation of new regulations. And so we have not heard anything about coming to us and saying no, don't do a deal.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","Rick, I would ask you a similar question about loan loss reserve methodology because we've heard this commentary or read this commentary from the OCC saying we're not pleased with loan loss reserve drawdowns, et cetera, et cetera. Is there any implicit or explicit guidance about what you should do with reserves going into 2013?","Richard J. Johnson","No, there's always a very active dialogue on the subject as you can imagine. But we have our models we run, we sit down, review with the regulators. But in the end -- and our accountants as well, right? And in the end, it's what we think we need to provide. Other than some of the challenges to the charge-off policies that you've seen during the course of the year, it's just -- it's more of a dialogue than it is a directive.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","Well, do you guys have any thoughts about this proposal, this FASB possibility of proposing life of loan reserve, et cetera?","Richard J. Johnson","Yes. I mean, it's in early days, obviously. The proposals out there, we had a chance to look at it before it came out. The comments are due by April, I think it is. I think this is something you're not going to see implemented until 2015 or '16. And if it is implemented, it probably means more of a onetime charge to equity and then higher capital or higher allowance coverage ratios going forward. And in my mind, it just means that we're going to have more capital set aside for the challenges in the future.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just -- first of all, just back on the issue of the GSE put-backs. Your level of outstanding put-back request at the end of the third quarter was up about 37% from the end of 2011. Could you update us on what the dollar amount of those outstanding requests were at the end of 2012?","James E. Rohr","I don't have that. Matt, I'd have to call you back. I don't have that level of detail here with me.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. It's usually in the Q. I was just curious if you had it now.","Richard J. Johnson","Matt, the only thing I would comment on is if you look at the bottom of the page, you look at the losses, based upon what we did in the second quarter based on demands, that's actually played out as expected. And you can see that some of the demands are coming down, and the losses are starting to either flatten out or ease. So based upon what they've told us, that's being managed pretty well. I think what's changed is they've made additional requests and so, obviously, we've had to reflect that in the current quarter.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes. And how do you get comfortable given what you've heard from the GSEs now that they've gone even further back into history in terms of getting comfortable that they're not going to further put more requests above what you're currently estimating? And I guess I'm just trying to get the sense of this is now sort of the second time you've done this, and I appreciate that the circumstances are different the second time. But how do investors get more comfortable that you and the GSEs are on the same page?","Richard J. Johnson","Well, the only thing I can say is we've got very strong reserves against this exposure. And if the industry gets it with more of these, we'll probably get it with more as well. We don't have a lot of risk from 2000 to '03 or smaller amount of risk. So I don't expect a huge impact from that.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then one final question on your increased savings guidance. And I just want to make sure I heard you correctly that the new target for the $700 million in continuous improvement savings is also going to be met with higher investments back into the business, so that extra $200 million is not necessarily going to flow into the pretax bottom line. Is that correct?","Richard J. Johnson","Well, that's the current estimate. And what I would say is, of that $700 million, $550 million is basically reinvesting back into our businesses, which includes $150 million plus related to the full year impact of the RBC acquisition. The other $150 million is basically what we have set aside at the moment for unanticipated charges. So we're not sure whether they'll come or they won't. So we have a little cushion -- well, we have a little cushion there. But things happen, and we thought we ought to be prepared for that in our forecast.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Oppenheimer.","Terence J. McEvoy - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","There was an article in early January talking about some of the challenges that PNC was facing on their move into the Southeast, and I was wondering if you could talk about maybe customer acceptance to the PNC [indiscernible] that the product mix. And as I look at Slide 4, any way you can break out within any of those areas, specifically the Southeast to maybe counter that argument or that article event?","James E. Rohr","I think -- I wish we have more markets like that where we have trouble breaking in. As I think we've discussed before, we had 270 jobs that we wanted to fill. We have over 10,000 job applications coming mostly from other bankers. We've filled those quite rapidly. I would say that as Rick said that it was -- the transaction was $0.40 accretive for the year, and each market we're in has exceeded our expectations. So when you look at it as a whole, what we did, as we always do, as we integrated it right into the company, and each market has its own Regional President, has its own goals and objectives. And so we don't maintain it as a separate company or a separate market because we have individual markets at the Regional Presidents were managed. Each one of them has a goal for this year, which is substantially in excess of last year, and I think everybody feels good about our meeting. And so we're very happy to be in the Southeast. As you know, as you recall, we paid meaningfully less than book for that franchise in the fastest-growing market of the United States. So we're very pleased.","Terence J. McEvoy - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And then just a follow-up. You've been there 3 quarters now. Could you talk about the competitive landscape, specifically on the Corporate Banking side in the Southeast versus some of your legacy markets? Any noticeable difference at all?","James E. Rohr","Well, the growth has been quite nice quite frankly. And there's been a lot of disruption in the Southeast, as you might imagine, over the last 3 or 4 years. A lot of the customers have had interesting experiences with their banks. There's been a lot of change in personnel, there's been a lot of layoffs. Obviously, the Southeast was dramatically impacted by the downturn and within their banks as well. And what we're seeing is that our brand, which brings to bear a company with high-quality products and a legacy of being able to take care of customers through the cycle is selling very, very well. So I think it's good news for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Bank.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Rick, coming back to your comments about the put-backs, can you give us a little more color on what the GSEs changed on you besides maybe going back deeper into further years, meaning 2004 and '05? Were there any other changes that from the original request that are different than this write-down, this reserve build?","Richard J. Johnson","We had specific requests clearly on the '04 to '05, and that was about half of the overall charge. We then had additional request on the '06 to '08 on modifications from the other regulator. And then what we decided to do was to say let's harmonize their demands so that we know they have the same regulator, but they'll be back for the rest and then we topped up the reserve for that, assuming what one is asking for, the other will eventually ask for. And so that got us to about $250 million and then we had current production of $4 million, and that's the charge of $254 million.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Good. Another question just regarding -- and maybe this is for you, Jim. Looking at your efficiency ratio, when things subside and we get back to normalization on credit costs and your integration of RBC is completed, what do you think PNC will be on an ongoing efficiency ratio? Where's a good target that you think you guys can get to?","James E. Rohr","Well, we would like to get into the 50s. But one of the things that happens with us because of our tax-free lending business and also because of some of the states that we're in with our share stacks, which count as expenses as opposed to tax, we have a different -- we will have a somewhat higher overhead ratio than others. I think it's worth about 4 percentage points.","Richard J. Johnson","Two. Two together. That's correct.","James E. Rohr","Two together. By the way, that's okay. We get it back as you see -- and Rick just gave guidance this morning that we expect our tax rate to be between 25% and 26%, which is lower than other people. So that impacts the expense ratio. But I think we have to continue to take expenses down. I don't think there's any question about this interest rate environment. The expenses just have to go down, and Rick mentioned that we have a target of $700 million this year. And if interest rates stay low, we're just going to have to continue to grind them down. That's how it is. So we'll do that by remaking, and I think we've made a couple of presentations about remaking the retail business. Because over 50% of our expenses are tied up with the retail business on operations and technology, so -- and a lot of that is driven there. But I think as the customer evolves, I think you'll see a lot of expense come out of the consumer business because they're using more efficient distribution services. We've talked about that where our brand's transaction costs $4, and we've now got -- I don't know what the number is anymore, but it's well over 10,000 items a day that are coming to us on deposits through a picture with a cellphone. And we haven't incented anybody to that financially here, but that's an opportunity clearly. So I think you'll see us continue to drive the number down, but it'll be higher than some others because of our business mix.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And Rick, coming back to you. On your securities portfolio, what is the duration of that now?","Richard J. Johnson","It's about 1.8 years, and we've got about weighted average life of about 3.2 years.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then finally, just a technical question on CCAR. When the assumption on the capital markets or the equities market falling, I think it was 50% again, is what you guys had to bake into your numbers. Did you have to write down the BlackRock investment by that amount as part of the CCAR process?","Richard J. Johnson","No, we didn't. No. But we did look at the BlackRock stake and looked at that as syncretic risk and assumed what it might happen to that if we had a significant impact in their overall earnings or in their goodwill and what that might mean to us.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And how about that Visa renewed position that you mentioned, was that -- were you required -- again, just in the CCAR, stress test analysis?","Richard J. Johnson","Yes, we had to look at that market value. But remember, the book value is only $250 million. So the likelihood of having impairment would be pretty slim.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","A follow-up on the RBC stuff down South. I mean, have you seen any decent loan growth yet? I mean, have you gotten any penetrations on the commercial side?","James E. Rohr","Yes.","Richard J. Johnson","And I think we are...","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Can you talk about it a little bit? I mean, what percentage of your growth is coming from down there?","Richard J. Johnson","Not a lot yet, Paul, and the reason being is remember when we acquired them, we ran off -- we're running off some balances related to the book. So with what we're able to originate, we're keeping the balances reasonably flat. So you're not seeing a net lift yet related to that book.","James E. Rohr","Well, the kinds of customers we're looking for, the kinds of quality customers we're looking for, we'll see a meaningful uptick.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And I know the knock on RBC they never really put any effort down there. Have you been able to expand say your retail bank? And I know there's other fees that you're expanding down there, but is the mortgage bank down there be getting any loans from those areas?","James E. Rohr","Yes. The most interesting thing is the fee income side. What we saw when we looked at RBC is we saw a company that really didn't have much of a platform at all in terms of products. The Royal really never build a product set for the U.S. As you know, it goes back to really a community bank platform. And so when we put in capital markets, we put in treasury management, we put in university banking, the lift has come from that. Also, we go around and call on corporate customers. They really didn't have the ability to serve us at all, and that's been a lift for us. Now there's a lot of -- there were a number of smaller customers with higher risk profiles that we've allowed to run off, and so that's why you don't see the big net lift as Rick said. The fee income lift and the customer growth has been well in excess of our expectations.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Two questions, one on the NIM. Maybe you could just give us a sense as to how much more flexibility is there on the liability side? Just wanted to understand what more you could do on bringing cost funds down.","Richard J. Johnson","Yes, Betsy, if you look at Page 6 of the supplement, now you're probably aware we put in a new chart there to try to help people to understand what we look like without the purchase accounting on rates and deals. And I think when you look at that, you'll see borrowed funds are down 1.23% and deposits at 31%. So probably not a lot of room on the deposit side; some, but not a lot. And we do have a few more opportunities on the borrowed funds, and we actually have some $200 million of trust preferred securities that we'll have to consider whether we're going to call them in the second quarter of this year. So there's still an opportunity to bring the borrowed funds cost down a bit. But the real -- most of what we could do on the liability side, we have done.","James E. Rohr","In the first half, we will, as you know, Betsy, we'll have the full year effect of the CDs that were repriced in the first half of last year. And then, of course, we have the trust preferred redemptions that took place over the course of the year, and we'll have that reduction on a full year basis in '13 as well.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right. And then battling the loan pressure is really a drive I would think on mix shift going from securities into loans because your loan-to-deposit ratio is still relatively light. Is that fair?","Richard J. Johnson","Well, that's why on Page 6 we want to break that out for you because as you look at it, we have had loan yields coming down. They've stabilized a bit. And right there, if you take out the purchase accounting, that 4% loan yield, we can replace that anywhere between the high 2s up to the mid-4s, depending on the mix of products we have. And where you're really going to see the drop is going to be on the securities side. But the more we can replace those security yields with loan yields, we have an opportunity to keep the overall asset deals hopefully pretty stable to down.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Sure. Okay. And then just the other question is on operating leverage as you've already described quite a bit in the prepared remarks and the Q&A. Based on what you're highlighting, you're going to see a pretty significant positive operating leverage in 1Q '13 versus 4Q '12. So then the question really is, do you sit back and watch how things go and we see some activity if you need to true up towards the end of the year? Or do you have a sense of targeted revenue run rate that if you're not hitting, you might end up doing more on the expense side before we necessarily see that you've slipped potentially on the operating leverage targets?","James E. Rohr","Well, I think your former point I think is correct. I mean, this is a continuous improvement process. We're going to have to continue to work on taking expenses down, as I mentioned in my comments. Because until the interest rates rise, where we get a 4% or 5% economic growth, neither which we're projecting, I think we just have to keep working on expenses and growing customers so that we have a good run rate going into '14. And that's a continuous improvement process for us, and I think there's a lot of opportunity for us to keep -- just to keep working on it. So I don't think this is a -- it maybe this could be, okay, we're going to take some expenses down in the fourth quarter. But I don't think that's the way we're approaching the year. We're approaching the year that we want to have expenses lower at the end of the quarter, expenses lower at the end of the year than they are at the beginning of the year, and then we'll have a lower run rate going into '14.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with PNC Bank (sic) [SunTrust Robinson Humphrey].","Eric Edmund Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Two questions, please. The first is in the middle of the fourth quarter, you guys disclosed in a presentation your Corporate Banking and AMG sales at RBC Bank, which at that point for 2012 year-to-date was $48 million. I was wondering if you had a year end statistic for that figure.","James E. Rohr","We've got to get back to you. I don't -- we don't have it with us. They're compiling that data now.","Eric Edmund Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then my second question is, several other institutions have indicated that with particular exposure to real estate in the Southeast as home price value stabilize or improve, it will facilitate reserve release in the related portfolios. And I wonder if that's true for you as well or if that's somehow captured somewhere else with respect to RBC acquisition and how it might manifest itself in your P&L.","Richard J. Johnson","Well, at the moment, we haven't anticipated that in the guidance we provided. What I would tell you is that we do expect our OREO-related costs to come down as a result of that. This year was roughly $120 million, and we think next year it'll be below $100 million.","Eric Edmund Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. But to the extent, for example...","James E. Rohr","When you see real estate prices increase, that would be a lovely thing for a lot of reasons.","Eric Edmund Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Certainly. But just so I understand with specific respect to the provision, would it result in release or did you, in your remarks, did you capture that some other way?","Richard J. Johnson","Yes. I don't see any release on the consumer side in the near term. And the guidance we've given so far is for the first quarter to say that it'll be about $200 million to $300 million of provision, and I don't see a lot of consumer releases. I do expect to continue to see releases on the corporate side. And we'll update that guidance afterwards as we start to see where those trends set.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","James E. Rohr","Okay. Thank you very much, everyone. Thanks for being with us this morning. As I mentioned earlier, we were very, very pleased with a number of things last year. Obviously, there were a couple of things we were less pleased with, but we look forward to a much quieter 2013 as integration costs and a lot of the TruP charges and the redemptions will be behind us and hopefully we don't have these mortgage -- the same mortgage issues in 2013, and we can just grow customers and grow income and reduce expenses.","Thank you very much, everyone.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Brian Gill. Sir, please go ahead.","Brian Gill","Thank you operator and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Demchak and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Our forward-looking statements regarding PNC performance assume a continuation of the current economic trends and do not take into account the impact of potential legal and regulatory contingencies. Actual results and future events could differ, possibly materially from those anticipated in our statements and from historical performance due to a variety of risks and other factors.","Information about such factors, as well as GAAP reconciliations and other information on non-GAAP financial measures we discuss is included in today's conference call, earnings release and related presentation materials and in our 10-K and various other SEC filings and investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of April 14, 2016 and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Bill Demchak.","Bill Demchak","Thanks Brian and good morning everybody. As you have all seen this morning, PNC reported net income of $943 million or $1.68 per diluted common share in the first quarter. Now that was down linked quarter and year-over-year as our results were impacted by weaker equity markets and lower capital markets activity which impacted our fee revenues as well as continued pressures across the energy industry which resulted in higher than expected loan loss provision.","In addition to normal seasonality, the weaker equity markets impacted the equity earnings that we received from our investment in BlackRock whose results you likely have already seen today. And while our overall asset quality remained relatively stable, our loan loss provision did increase $78 million to $152 million this quarter. Now this increase is primarily related to reserves for our oil and gas and coal exposure. In spite of these factors, it was a pretty solid quarter for PNC as we continue to focus on the execution of our strategic priorities.","We grew loans and deposits on a spot basis this quarter. You saw that net interest income increased linked quarter, driven by growth in core NII and importantly, noninterest expenses were down about 5% due to seasonally lower business activity but also our ongoing focus on disciplined expense management. We also saw good momentum in some of our businesses.","In the corporate and institutional bank, we saw continued year-over-year growth in treasury management as we benefit from new customer wins, strong growth trends in corporate payments and repricing activities. We also maintained momentum in our underpenetrated markets, particularly across the Southeast in Chicago where we are building high-quality customer driven franchises. Wins in the core middle-market and cross sell demonstrate the efficacy of our model.","Now within our retail bank, we saw good year-over-year and linked quarter growth in earnings and we continue to see improved efficiency within the business as we execute our ongoing strategy to reinvent the retail banking experience with more customers migrating to nonbranch channels for most of their transactions and the expansion over universal branch model.","It was a decent quarter for our asset management group also. Inside this business, fee income was down just 4% linked quarter and 2% year-over-year, despite the weakness in the equity markets during the quarter. Meanwhile, AUA actually ticked up during the quarter as we continued to see positive flows. At the same time however, despite an increase in NII this quarter, we continue to be impacted by interest rates that remain near all-time lows and we have had to adjust to the reality of at least one less rate hike in 2016 than we previously forecast.","Now, Rob will have more to say about that in a few minutes. But on the whole, although this quarter will be reported as a miss, we were solid in terms of our execution against the things that are in our power to control. Despite the hit to provision this quarter, beyond the energy book and certain exposures in the steel industry, we don't see negative trends in other areas of credit. In fact, our total nonperforming assets have declined by about $200 million year-over-year. And our core business has performed well, relative to market conditions in the ongoing interest rate environment.","Now Rob will speak to the details of our guidance, but I would say as we look out at the landscape, the condition supporter view that the fundamentals remain solid in the U.S. economy. The labor market continues to improve and the tight job market is going to eventually lead businesses to raise wages, which should in turn support consumer spending. Also, we see housing and commercial construction offsetting drag from trade and the downturn in energy production.","Within our businesses, we continue to make progress against each of our strategic priorities. We are working hard to continuously improve the customer experience across our lines of business and I am confident in our long-term ability to continue to create value for our shareholders.","And with that I will turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our first quarter results and then we will take your questions.","Rob Reilly","Thanks, Bill and good morning everyone. PNC's first quarter net income was $943 million or $1.68 per diluted common share. First quarter results reflected the expected seasonal declines in business activity. However, as Bill mentioned, results were also adversely affected by weaker equity markets, lower capital markets activity and energy portfolio pressures. Offsetting these items were growth in net interest income and strong expense management.","Our balance sheet is on slide four and is presented on an average basis. Commercial lending was up $2 billion or 2% from the fourth quarter primarily reflecting growth in commercial real estate along with increases in large corporate loans. Average consumer lending declined by $865 million or 1% linked quarter, in part due to the year-end derecognition of purchased impaired loans as well as decreases in home equity and education loans.","Investment securities were up $2.4 billion or 4% linked quarter and increased $13.1 billion or 23% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Portfolio purchases were comprised primarily of agency residential mortgage-backed securities and other liquid data and asset backed securities. Our interest-earning deposits with the Federal Reserve averaged $25.5 billion for the quarter, down $6 billion from the fourth quarter as we shifted some Fed deposits to higher yielding assets.","On the liability side, total deposits declined by $803 million or less than 1% when compared to the fourth quarter as growth in consumer deposits was more than offset by seasonally lower commercial deposits. Of note, consumer savings deposits increased by $5.5 billion linked quarter reflecting our strategy towards relationship based savings products. Total equity remained stable in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Retained earnings and higher AOCI were essentially offset by common share repurchases.","Turning to capital. As of March 31, 2016, our pro forma Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio fully phased-in and using the standardized approach was estimated to be 10.1%, essentially flat link quarter as we continue to return capital to shareholders through our dividends and share buybacks. During the first quarter, we repurchased 5.9 million common shares for approximately $500 million. As a result, period-end common shares outstanding were 499 million, down 21 million or 4% compared to the same time a year ago. For the fourth quarter period that ended March 31, 2016, our total payout ratio, including dividends and buybacks under the current share repurchase program was 85%. Finally, our tangible book value reached $65.15 per common share as of March 31, a 6% increase compared to the same time a year ago.","As you can see on slide five, net income was $943 million. Highlights include the following. Net interest income increased by $6 million linked quarter despite a lower day count driven by growth of $10 million in core net interest income. Noninterest income was $1.6 billion, a decrease of $194 million or 11% linked quarter. This decline was primarily driven by weaker equity markets and lower capital markets activity, along with seasonally lower client revenue. Noninterest expense decreased by $115 million, or 5% compared to the fourth quarter.","Expenses continue to be well managed, due in part to our continuous improvement program. However, expenses also declined as a result of lower business activity. Provision expense in the first quarter was $152 million, an increase of $78 million compared with the fourth quarter due to certain energy related loans, which I will discuss in more detail in a few minutes. Finally, our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 23.5%, down from the 26.1% rate in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 25%.","Now, let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to net interest income on slide six. Core net interest income increased by $10 million linked quarter primarily driven by higher loan and securities balances and higher loan yields, partially offset by the impact of the consistently low interest rates and one less day in the quarter. Purchase accounting accretion declined by $4 million linked quarter. For 2016, we continue to expect purchase accounting accretion to be down approximately $175 million compared to 2015. Net interest margin was 2.75%, an increase of five basis points compared to the fourth quarter. This was primarily due to the impact of lower Fed deposits and higher loan balances and yields.","Turning to noninterest income on slide seven. In addition to normal seasonality, which typically impacts the first quarter, weaker equity markets and lower capital markets activity contributed further to the linked quarter decline of $194 million. Asset management fees, which includes earnings from our equity investment in BlackRock were down $58 million or 15% on a linked quarter basis. Of that amount, PNC's asset management group represents $8 million of the decline. Despite the decline in the equity markets, discretionary client assets under management increased by $1 billion linked quarter to $135 billion, reflecting solid net flows.","Consumer services fees and deposit services charges were both lower compared to fourth quarter results reflecting seasonally lower client activity. Within consumer services, brokerage fees increased 4% linked quarter, driven by account activity and growth. Compared to the first quarter of last year, consumer services fees grew by $26 million or 8%, with growth in all categories. Highlights include increased debit and credit card activity along with higher brokerage income, all consistent with our efforts to meet the broad financial needs of our customers. Service charges on deposits increased by $5 million or 3% compared to the same period a year ago, driven by higher customer activity.","Corporate services fees declined by $69 million or 18% compared to fourth quarter results, which are typically strong. However, beyond seasonality this category was also affected by lower activity levels in the broader capital markets. As a result, first quarter results were also lower year-over-year. On the positive side, we saw good trends in our treasury management business on a year-over-year basis and we expect that to continue, driven by strong customer relationships in new products.","Residential mortgage noninterest income declined by $13 million or 12% linked quarter. Most of the decrease was driven by our hedging results. Mortgage originations were down compared to the fourth quarter, due in part to closing delays resulting from the implementation of new disclosure requirements. However, servicing fees increased both linked quarter and compared to the same quarter a year ago.","Other noninterest income decreased by $30 million or 9% linked quarter, primarily due to lower gains on asset dispositions. We also had slightly lower gain from the sale of VISA stock. Going forward, we would expect this year's quarterly run rate for other noninterest income to be in the range of $225 million to $275 million, excluding net securities and VISA gains. In summary, despite weaker equity markets and lower capital markets activity in the first quarter, we continue to believe that our underlying transfer fee income are favorable and we expect that to continue due to a strong new business pipeline.","Turning to expenses on slide eight. First quarter levels decreased by $115 million or 5%, reflecting our continued focus on disciplined expense management along with both seasonal and lower market related business activities. The decline in linked quarter was primarily due to lower variable compensation and employee benefits. As we have previously stated, our continuous improvement program has a goal to reduce costs by $400 million in 2016. We are one quarter of the way through the year and we have already completed actions to capture more than one-third of our annual goal. We remain confident we will achieve our full-year target. Through this program, we intend to help fund the significant investments we are continuing to make in our technology and business infrastructure throughout the year. As a result, we continue to expect that our full-year 2016 expenses will remain stable to 2015 levels.","Turning to slide nine. Overall, we view our firm-wide credit quality as relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter as improvements in our consumer loans and commercial real estate portfolios were offset by deterioration in our energy portfolio. Total delinquencies, including the impact of energy loans continue to decline on both a year-over-year and linked quarter basis. In addition, it's important to note that many of our customers benefit from lower energy prices.","What the graph on slide nine depict is the impact on our credit metrics of both energy-related loans as well as our nonenergy related portfolio. Nonperforming loans increased by $155 million or 7% linked quarter, as $259 million of new nonperforming energy loans were partially offset by $104 million net reduction in nonenergy related commercial and consumer portfolios. On a year-over-year basis, nonperforming loans decreased by $124 million or 5% even with the impact of the energy nonperforming loans. Provision for credit losses increased by $78 million linked quarter and totaled $152 million, over half of which was energy related. Nonenergy provision increased by $21 million, reflecting the continuing normalization over the historically and in our view unsustainably low levels we experienced throughout 2015.","Net charge-offs increased to $149 million in the quarter, resulting in a net charge-off ratio of 29 basis points. Energy related charge-offs represented approximately 17% of losses and the remainder was due to consistent levels of charge-offs for home equity, credit card and other commercial loans in the linked quarter comparison.","Now let's take a deeper look at our energy book. We view our energy portfolio, which represents 1.6% of our total outstanding loans as well defined and properly reserved. As you can see on slide 10, at the end of the first quarter we had total outstandings of $2.7 billion in oil and gas and $535 million in coal. Total outstandings in our oil and gas portfolio are up 4% on a linked quarter basis, but down 5% compared to the first quarter of last year.","Breaking down the portfolio, we have approximately $800 million in outstandings to upstream exploration and production companies, $1 billion to midstream and downstream companies and $900 million to oilfield services. We believe this mix is favorable relative to others in the industry. As you know, our focus remains on the services book and while we have seen some pressure on this portfolio, approximately $700 million or almost 80% of the $900 million is asset based, which by definition is collateralized. As of March 31, 2016, our loan loss reserves for oil and gas represented 5% of outstanding in this portfolio.","These reserves include the impact of the recently completed Shared National Credit exam. Utilization levels for oil and gas have remained fairly constant. They were at 34% as of March 31 of this year, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter and the same time a year ago. Total unused commitments were $5.4 billion as of March 31 of this year. Redetermination of the borrowing bases for E&P loans is ongoing and we would expect to see continued reductions in lines as a result. Approximately 38% of our oil and gas loans are criticized up from 28% linked quarter.","Turning to coal. Our portfolios significantly contributed to our provision this quarter. Going forward, however, while coal prices remain under pressure, our overall portfolio is small and our remaining risk is concentrated in a handful of specific credits. Our reserve against this portfolio is 15% and criticized balances represent approximately 37% of outstandings, up from 27% linked quarter. Lastly, in regard to our overall energy portfolio, we continue to monitor market conditions as well as consequential impact to other businesses. If energy prices remain pressured, this will continue to affect our provision.","In summary, PNC posted a solid first quarter driven by higher net interest income and strong expense management. Offsetting this were weaker equity markets, lower capital markets activity, energy pressures and seasonality. Looking ahead, we believe the economy will continue to grow at a steady pace based on an improving labor market and solid overall economic trends. Because of this, our current forecast anticipates that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates in both June and December with each increase being 25 basis points.","Our full-year 2015 guidance continues to call for modest growth in revenue and stable expenses which by definition positions us to deliver positive operating leverage. Looking ahead at the second quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter reported results, we expect modest growth in loans, we expect modest increases in net interest income, we expect fee income to be at 10% to 12%, reflecting the higher anticipated business levels in the second quarter, we expect expenses to be up in the mid-single digits, primarily as a result of the higher anticipated business activity as well as seasonality and we expect provision to be between $125 million and $175 million, which reflects our view of continued near-term energy pressures.","And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. It's Betsy. Can you hear me?","Bill Demchak","Yes.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. Yes. I just wanted to get a sense. You did obviously put or move significant amount or not significant, but a part of your investments with the Fed into other parts of the portfolio. So I just want to get a sense where you have changed? It looks like you have accelerated a little bit this quarter. Is that accurate? And is there more to do that would potentially help support the NIM as we move forward here?","Bill Demchak","The bulk of what you saw in terms of growth in securities actually came from TBAs that we bought in the fourth quarter when rates were a bit higher and settled into this quarter. So we kind of took advantage of when rates were at that point the tenure was well above two. Now that they have rallied back, we are kind of holding portfolio pretty constant. And if they stay where they are, through time it would actually cause that securities book yield to decline as opposed to see the growth you saw in the first quarter.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then the second question was just on the case of NPLs. And the reason I asked the question is, a lot of us came into the quarter expecting that we would see an uptick in NPLs, part of it this SNC related reviews and some investors are asking, okay, well if this look at prior cycles, is this the beginning of an uptick that's going to last several more quarters or a year plus or are we behaving a little bit differently and trying to get ahead of the deterioration that we are seeing in the oil space, et cetera?","Rob Reilly","Yes. This is Rob. See, obviously, the biggest impact to NPLs is the change in the energy portfolio, which we highlight in the slides. Underlying that, it's still pretty benign. When we take a look at the improvements on the consumer portfolios and in some parts of the commercial portfolios offsetting that. So that's why you are seeing sort of stable levels.","Bill Demchak","But if your question is, have we seen the end of NPLs coming from energy, the answer to that is no. Even inside of our ABL book where we might have very small charge-offs, because it's secured, we expect that we are going to have a number of credits that we are going to have to liquidate inside of that book, particularly in the services sector, which is what they bank. So you will see NPLs continue, I think, on the energy book. To the best of our ability and consistent with the SNC review, we are fully reserved for what we know today.","Betsy Graseck","Right. So pace of change, can you just give us a sense on that as we sit here?","Bill Demchak","Look, one thing I would say about this quarter was, there was a couple of lumpy credits that you would like to think aren't going to come through like that again. But I can't promise that. I would expect that this will play out through time. This quarter we had a couple of lumpy ones that --","Rob Reilly","All in energy.","Bill Demchak","Yes, all in energy.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Bill Demchak","Yes. That's the biggest point. We dig through all related areas and reserve for those two, but beyond what we are seeing in energy and as I mentioned in my comments, some of the specialty steel guys that supply the energy sector, there just really isn't credit pressure showing up in the C&I space or real estate and certainly in the consumer space. Consumers are really strong.","Rob Reilly","And ex-energy, why you see the NPLs going down.","Betsy Graseck","So there is opportunity to in fact potentially increase the loan growth rate, given the fact that you have got a pretty modest outlook for credit at this stage, especially since some players have been exiting?","Bill Demchak","Well, you are not going to see us grow the loan book inside the energy space anytime soon, I don't think. And we have been focused on dropping and we continue to focus on specifically dropping our coal book. But beyond that, we are seeing pickup, for example, in our ABL book as there is pressures in other areas of leverage lending just on ability for people to get deals done. We have seen more and more deals commendatory ABL book. If you dug into that, you would see the spreads in that book are up pretty substantially quarter-on-quarter, as we are getting pricing power back. Pricing power in growth in the generic C&I space, we will continue to win customers, but it is very competitive. And as you know, we don't really change a credit box and we remain focused on the right return on the capital we deploy. So that will display out through time.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.","Brian Gill","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please proceed with your question.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning. Bill and good morning, Rob. Can you guys give us any color, obviously, the CCAR was pushed back a quarter and the curveball this year was the negative rate environment, could you share with us how it went in your preparation for that in terms of the handling of the negative rate environment from a systems standpoint.","Rob Reilly","Yes. Hi, Gerard. Good morning. It's Rob. So we did submit our capital plan and as you know, in the one scenario around negative interest rates, we had buildout a plan for that. To your question around operating capabilities, we believe that we can do that. It would require some manual workarounds. But part of the drill was to be able to show that we could handle it. That doesn't mean that we anticipate it, but generally speaking, if that were to occur, we think we have got the manual workarounds to be able to support it.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And then Bill, in the past on these calls, you have talked about ideal fully phased-in Basel II Tier 1 common ratio below 10% or below 10.1% where you are today. What do you think is going to take for PNC to able to, because currently now you are paying out close to earnings in your combined ratio of dividends and buybacks, what do you think it is going to be able to take for you guys to go over that 100% level, not to say that you asked for it this year, but what's going to be able to get you to do that?","Bill Demchak","There are so many factors in that question. One is, we have to ask for it, as you mentioned. In fact, that's the most important. But the other thing, just to remind you, we focus on the end result of the stress not the starting point. So in a benign environment, with the consistence Fed stress, we had said that we could operate below the 10% which is what you are referring to, but we got there by looking at the results post stress. I am not going to comment on this year's CCAR. We submitted it. We will wait and see what they say. But through time and the right environment, we ought to be able to drive that ratio down and the way we would do it is by going beyond the 100% in ask and again I say that through time. Fed has been pretty explicit that there isn't a hard boundary at 100% payout. So it's a question of having the right environment and asking for it.","Gerard Cassidy","And regarding the post-stress capital ratio, which I think currently is 4.5%, last year you guys obviously were well above that. Do you have a comfort level? Or do you want to be 200 to 300 basis points above whatever the post-stress requirement is after you go through CCAR?","Bill Demchak","We obviously have a buffer built into our capital policy beyond the minimum of the 4.5%. I remind you, last year in the published results and correct me if I am wrong here, Rob, but while we were well above that minimum that had the phase-ins.","Rob Reilly","That's right. The transitional.","Bill Demchak","Transitional calculations and of course we are always thinking towards the fully implemented when we actually run our capital plan.","Gerard Cassidy","Sure. And then just lastly, coming back to the energy portfolio, could you share with us what percentage of the portfolio is participations in syndicated credits? And second, of the increase in the provision, how much of it was due to the syndicated portion of that portfolio?","Rob Reilly","Yes. I don't have that offhand.","Bill Demchak","I think generically what you would find is the midstream and services are more direct and since we were never into the reserve based stuff, probably more of that is participations. But we would have to dig that out.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. Great. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Brian Gill","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Siefers","Good morning, guys. Rob, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the expected makeup of the provision guidance, the $125 million to $175 million. I guess as I look at things, the cross currents seem to be the non-energy portfolio is behaving great but the provision is starting to creep up and then obviously the smaller portion of the portfolio that is energy has understandably much higher credit costs associated. So as you look at that $125 million to $175 million, how much would be your best guess for how much is energy related versus non-energy, to the extent you can talk about it?","Rob Reilly","Yes. Well, I can give you some direction in terms of the way that, at least that we think about it. You are right. At a base level, energy aside, at a base level, we have said for some time, we would expect credit cost to normalize off the very, very low levels that we experienced in 2015, that I mentioned in my opening comments, but not at a rapid rate. I think when you take a look at the second quarter, most of the variance will be driven by what results from the energy portfolio. And that's why we built that into our guidance. And inside of that, particularly as it relates to our coal portfolio, it's a specific handful of credits and how some of those might behave, the lumpiness of that is where you are going to see the variance.","Bill Demchak","One of the things where we struggle with is, as provision has generally been so low that single credit can double provision, just because we are operating off such a low base. So it gives us some pause, frankly, as we think out and put guidance on what provision will be a quarter out. Obviously we jumped that range from where we were a quarter ago because we were surprised by a couple of credits and thought it made sense to bring it up a little bit and widen the variance up a little bit.","Scott Siefers","Okay. All right. That's perfect. Thank you. And then just one quick follow-up. Rob, could you offer maybe a little more color as to kind of the activities or market assumptions that you have embedded into the fee guidance in the second quarter?","Rob Reilly","Yes. Sure, that's a good question. So our guidance is up about 10% to 12%. And if you just sort break the components down, I will help you with that math. Asset management, as you know, is comprised of both our equity investment in BlackRock as well as our own asset management group. The BlackRock piece, as you head this morning, BlackRock had an episodic oriented first quarter. They do expect some tailwinds going into the second quarter that if go back into the normal range of what they had which they expect, you get to a 10% kind of number, maybe a little better.","Our asset management business is probably in the mid to high single digits based on the pipeline. So asset management because it's weighted more toward BlackRock in terms of the second quarter in that range. Secondly, the corporate services probably growing double digit, if you take a look into that, our M&A business are markets related were down. Business pipelines are very strong there. So we would expect that to grow within the guidance range.","Consumer services, which has been growing year-over-year, we expect that to continue probably in the mid to high single digits that we have experienced. And then residential mortgage which is small, coming off a seasonally low quarter, we would expect production gains, although small in absolute dollar sense to be in comfortably in the guidance percent range. So that's the math.","Scott Siefers","Okay. Perfect. That's great. Thank you very much.","Bill Demchak","Sure.","Brian Gill","Next question, please.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR &Co. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Miller","Yes. Thank you very much. I have been jumping all over the place today, so I don't know if you answered this question or not. I know you guys did a really good job talking about your energy exposure, but what about the second derivative, especially in parts of the Ohio Valley and Western Pennsylvania where I think it's more energy related than anything else? Are you seeing any material weakness in some other commercial credits outside of energy and especially CRE?","Bill Demchak","No, we are not. And you know, the one place and I already mentioned it where we are seeing contagion and we have thought about this and sort of counted as part of our exposure in some cases is inside the metal space. So the suppliers to energy obviously get impacted. And that's included in some of our reserve build and frankly some of our charge-offs. We are watching, just as an aside and inside our local economy, Ohio, Pennsylvania, it's quite strong. So notwithstanding the pullback in shale and the investment, there is no particular weaknesses in the local surrounding region. We are obviously watching CRE in certain markets. You think about exposures that would be down in Texas. We have some real estate exposures down there that we are watching carefully. But thus far real estate continues to behave very well.","Paul Miller","And then, I think I caught the tail-end of the comments, because I had to jump around on some calls, but are you still in your guidance expecting some rate hikes in 2016?","Bill Demchak","Yes. We still have two in there. It's a practical matter, only one matters because you the second would be, at the end of the year it would impact 2017 as opposed to what we do this year, but that is in there.","Paul Miller","Okay. Hey, guys, thank you for picking up.","Bill Demchak","Sure.","Brian Gill","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Bill Demchak","Good morning, John.","Rob Reilly","Good morning, John.","John Pancari","A couple of things on energy. How much of the first quarter provision was related to coal versus energy? Do you have that? Or coal versus oil and gas?","Rob Reilly","Yes. About half, John.","Bill Demchak","Half of the 80%.","Rob Reilly","Yes. That's right.","John Pancari","Okay. Got it. And then separately, also on the energy front, do you have the energy NPL or the NPL ratio that is for coal and then for oil and gas?","Rob Reilly","Well, we have the criticized that we talk about, which in both cases is about 37%.","John Pancari","Okay. But the actual amount that's on non-accrual, do you have that?","Rob Reilly","I don't have that as broken out.","Bill Demchak","We didn't break that out in the disclosure, John.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. That's fine.","Rob Reilly","Of the total energy, you can extrapolate that, the total energy nonperforming loans, it has been roughly in the first quarter about half.","John Pancari","Got it. Okay. All right. And then the efficiency ratio held relatively stable this quarter and generally in line with what we were expecting. Can you just give us your updated thoughts on the efficiency ratio trajectory over time through the back half of this year and possibly some color into 2017, how we could think about it?","Rob Reilly","Well, sure. So we don't manage the efficiency ratio. We are sort of more geared toward trying to deliver positive operating leverage, which we are still positioned to be able to do. Expenses, in general, we had a good quarter. Our continuous improvement program which is designed to generate expense reductions is running a little bit ahead of where we expected to be. So that's helping out in the first quarter. But we are still guiding because of the seasonal factors and investments that we plan to make and hopefully what we anticipate in terms of higher expenses around greater levels of business for expenses to be stable in 2015 and in-line with the positive operating leverage that we anticipate.","John Pancari","Okay. Stable expenses in 2016 versus 2015?","Rob Reilly","Yes. Stable 2016 compared to 2015.","John Pancari","Got it. Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.","Bill Demchak","Sure.","Brian Gill","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Rob Placet","Hi. Good morning. This is Rob Placet from Matt's team. Just on your outlook for 2Q net interest income, I was just curious how much of an increase you would consider modest this quarter?","Rob Reilly","Yes. Well, so our guidance was for modest increase here in the first quarter, which was $6 million. So that's one data point.","Rob Placet","Okay. So similar increase?","Rob Reilly","Yes. I think that's right.","Rob Placet","Okay. And then on your energy exposure, total exposure of $8.1 billion, I was curious how big of a risk you view line drawdowns in your portfolio and have you seen any of this behavior to-date?","Rob Reilly","Well, in terms of the $8.1 billion, you need to break it down, obviously in the components I talked about in my opening comments. We watch utilization rates and they have been remarkably steady. So we are at roughly 35% in terms of utilization. That's where we were in the fourth quarter. And that's where we were a year ago. So we don't see any big change there. We would expect over time for some of that exposure to come down because with the redetermination that I talked about in E&P and just some of the general contraction, the utilization rates could change.","Bill Demchak","Yes. One of the issues, it's kind of a misleading number, particularly for the asset based book because the fact there is a borrowing base that they can borrow against and only up to that amount, independent of what the original line was, so while much of the DHE in the asset based book, the dry rates or whatever they are, their ability to actually draw to that amount would be entirely dependent on having valuable collateral to back that loan. So I think we are going to see as a practical matter, the outstandings, as values fall and the asset based book fall and we will see the lines fall and perhaps outstandings inside as we go through the reserved determination in the E&P book.","Rob Placet","Okay. Thanks very much.","Bill Demchak","Yes.","Brian Gill","Can we have the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Ken Usdin","Hi. Thanks a lot. Just a follow-up on the balance sheet mix and composition. Bill, to your point earlier about the TBAs that closed in the first quarter and led to a bigger portfolio, just with rates having moved down on the long-end, I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on using cash from here, what you are doing with securities portfolio run-off and how you want to try to balance that mix right now?","Bill Demchak","Yes. We are basically treading water here. So we grew when we saw the first bump in the backend, late in the fourth quarter and as things have rallied, we have effectively been replacing run-off with that and we will continue to do so until we see some opportunity here.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And then as far as just your loan outlook, loan growth has been pretty good and it looks like it has still been pretty diverse. You had taken a little bit of a pause prior just given that we were seeing some competition and we were kind of long in the cycle. How do you just look at the competitive landscape in terms of pricing and where you are seeing growth in the commercial side of the loan portfolio as far as your expectations going forward?","Bill Demchak","Yes. It really hasn't changed. The specialty segments continue to grow. Generic middle-market commercial is a tough fight. So you see growth and we would expect it to accelerate in our asset base book, perhaps in equipment finance. Obviously inside of the real estate space, we had strong year-on-year and quarterly growth, principally as a result of changing the mix from new project loans to permanent financing term loans. As your aware, that the disruption in the CMBS market and the risk retention rules coming online, have driven a lot of that product at good pricing structure towards the bank. So we would expect to see that to continue.","Rob Reilly","Yes. And Ken, just in addition to that, in the large corporate loan book, we have seen progress.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Got it. Thanks a lot, guys.","Brian Gill","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Erika Najarian","Hi. Good morning.","Bill Demchak","Hi Erika.","Erika Najarian","Just a quick follow-up question. Bill, could you remind us where you are on your systems upgrade project, please?","Bill Demchak","Everybody always want to know what inning we are in, but rather than talk about this, I will talk about what we have accomplished. We have one new data center up and running. We have got the second one basically turned on and are starting to plan out migration activities to that. We are largely through the upgrades to applications so that they can run in a virtual environment. We have done the bulk of our investments in cyber and fraud. So we are pretty far along and making good progress. I think in dollars, Rob, if you want to comment, last year was our biggest.","Rob Reilly","That's right. Our biggest spend, yes. So in terms of dollars in the innings, we are getting to the later innings. Of course, will pick up some of the depreciation that goes along the ways, but we are on our way and by the end of this year, Bill, that second data center will be up and running.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And just as a follow-up to that, thank you for giving the color on where you are on the spend. The reason I ask is, it seems like investors are not just interested in that question not just because of how they are thinking about the incremental spend from here, but also I am fielding questions on whether or not being done or mostly done with the project changes the way you are thinking about your M&A strategy. And so, Bill, I would appreciate your thoughts on that.","Bill Demchak","It's probably a year ago I made the comment and I wish I didn't, but I made the comment that we would have the technical ability in terms of having the systems ready to do an integration if we wanted to do that. But we don't want to do that. So our attitude on M&A in terms of buying other banks remains the same and that we are basically out of the market. I don't see value there. I think there is many other things that we can spend our capital on to offer better return to shareholders.","Just as an aside, one of the things that I think people miss as it relates to a lot of the work we are doing in the core infrastructure is what it ultimately allows us to do with customers in terms of product offerings and customer services. We actually had an API test internally here last week where we had employees form teams and opened up all the API for our online mobile and online banking capabilities and turn them loose to create new service apps for customers, all of which is fantastic, but none of which works unless you have an environment that allows you to quickly deploy these new products. And that's what we are building and that's where I think the big benefit ultimately comes from, for all the money we spent inside the technology space.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you.","Brian Gill","Next question, please.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Kevin Barker","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I noticed in the auto portfolio you were fairly aggressive in growing that portfolio in 2012 and into 2013 but have since pulled back and have seen very little growth compared to the rest of the industry in the last couple of years. Obviously your FICO score is very high, near over 750 on average. Could you just give us a feel for what you are seeing in the industry and what are the reasons why you are not as aggressive as you were in the past?","Bill Demchak","Well, we are exactly where we were in the past. We are just not growing at the same pace. We haven't changed our credit box and everybody else has. By the way, that's a pretty consistent practice for us across all of our lending type. So we have tried to hold true to where we see real economic return in the auto book and you have seen other people, as you know, drop into the subprime space and go increasing into leasing where we don't play. But one thing that has grown for us this quarter inside of auto was actually the direct book where we have something called a check ready product, where customers, in effect, get the car loan without going through the dealer. That continues to grow at a very healthy clip. But beyond that, we see other people lengthening tenure, going subprime in terms of FICO, higher advance rates.","Rob Reilly","Taking risk we don't want to take.","Bill Demchak","Yes. And you see the delinquencies tick up across the industry as a result.","Kevin Barker","Is this something you are seeing particularly from the nonbanks? Or are you also seeing several large banks that are competing in the market?","Bill Demchak","You know the answer to that question. So I am not going to answer it.","Kevin Barker","Well, I appreciate the color. Thank you very much.","Brian Gill","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.","Matt Burnell","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question, guys. Just a question on the consumer growth. That's been much lower than what you have seen on the commercial side despite what appears to be a bit more demand on the consumer side. So I guess I am curious, maybe Rob, can you give us a little more color as to what's going on specifically within the consumer portfolio and why it appears you all are growing that portfolio a little bit slower than peers? And I am wondering if there's a decline in the government insured portfolio within other consumer that's maybe hiding some of the core growth there?","Bill Demchak","Well, that true in the student loan book that continues to run off, but there is two big run off in education lending as we run off the old government guaranteed book and continued declines inside of the home equity space. Largely while we continue to originate there at a healthy clip, just the size of the book that came with a combination of PNC and National City, remember they had a large national business, our production isn't keeping up with the maturities. So it's dropping as they hit maturities. We have seen drops in small business lending and largely that's around our ability bluntly to make money against some of the loans we see being made. It's a tough business to get a good return on without a lot of cross sell and a lot of that business has become loan only going to the small banks and our books declined as a result.","Rob Reilly","And then just the other two categories, auto we just talked about, which is risk management and then credit card, although it's relatively small for us, the growth has been pretty good year-over-year and we would expect that to continue.","Bill Demchak","Yes. The file one thing is, as you know, while we have grown some residential mortgage loans on balance sheet, we haven't been balance sheeting a lot and our production isn't that much. So a lot of the consumer growth you are getting, when you look at other banks is actually coming from simply retaining self originating mortgages.","Matt Burnell","Sure. That's fair. And then if I can just as a follow-up, Bill, I think you mentioned earlier in your comments about a repricing across some of the commercial areas which I took to mean an upward repricing. Can you give us a little more color on that and how those repricing efforts are being responded to by clients?","Bill Demchak","So I was specifically referring to what's going on inside of the asset based lending space. Most of the rest of C&I, frankly, somewhat illogically has held pretty constant notwithstanding what we have seen credit spreads do in the capital markets. But inside of ABL, as credits either move from being a cash flow credit get refinanced in ABL or people start to get into trouble and trip a covenant or trip something. Our ability to charge fees and ratchet spread is pretty aggressive. It's part of the original loan terms. As a fact of the matter, clients who use that product knows how it works. So I suspect they don't particularly like it. Nobody like to pay more, but that's the environment. And by the way, it is entirely consistent with many cycles we have been through in the past. ABL does really well when credit conditions get tight. That's what we are seeing.","Matt Burnell","Right. And then just to tag onto that, in terms of the energy portfolio, how do you manage the overall exposure relative to your loan agreements and when customers want to tap those unused lines, your being able to control that in terms of the covenants that you have that you have in your documents?","Bill Demchak","You almost have to go sector-by-sector and credit-by-credits. So there is high-grade energy credits inside of that services book that basically can draw when they want. There is asset based credits inside of the services book and midstream who have to have collateral value to allow the draw to occur, independent of what the line is. So simplest form in asset base, I can give you $20 million line, but if you have $10 million of collateral, we probably let you draw $8 million. And of course, in the reserve based stuff, it's a function of the forward, in effect projected value of the reserves coming out of the ground that give rise to that borrowing base. So it's across-the-board dependent on credit structure and ultimately whether, as is with some of those credits, whether they are really high investment-grade.","Matt Burnell","Okay. Thanks very much.","Brian Gill","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities. Please proceed.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Bill, can you broadly discuss the clearXchange opportunity? And in particular, do you envision the existing ACH system remaining in place and clearXchange basically just being a superior real-time P2P money transfer offering that would exist above and beyond that? Or is the vision that ACH would eventually go away and be replaced by clearXchange?","Bill Demchak","I don't know if I can do it briefly. First off, what is going on with the merger of EWS and clearXchange, there is six banks plus ourselves who collectively purchase this, we are creating a real-time P2P payment network that's going to be ubiquitous offering that we would like to get out into every banks' hands in the country, such that whether you are a PNC client or a Bank of America client, or a Fifth Third client, you have the same app that is pre-populated with information in a secure way to allow you to make payments person-to-person.","Entirely different than what we are doing at the clearinghouse as it relates to real-time payments in the potential down the road substitutability of ACH. So ACH is now gone. There is now same day ACH. You will have seen, the clearinghouse announced the build of a real-time payment system that today we envision certain use cases for, you might see it for payroll, you might see it simply when somebody wants to make a payment they don't want to wait a day on.","Whether or not that takes some or all of the volume off of ACH through time, we will wait and see. But today, those are two very different things. One thing focused on consumer payments, P2P make it really easy for consumers in a secure way to move money around, the other one mostly focused sort of an institutional payments.","Bill Carcache","Understood. Thank you. That's very helpful. And a separate follow-up question, Rob, for you. In response to the response that you gave to the earlier question about utilization and line draw-downs, can you discuss how you guys factor in the probability of utilization rates rising as we move deeper into the credit cycle?","Rob Reilly","We haven't focused a whole lot on that. Obviously we take a look at utilization for trends in terms of where they are. The percentage itself is something that you want to monitor. But again, if exposure comes down and percentage goes up, that's different than if it's the other way around.","Bill Demchak","To be very clear, in a generic credit book, we on a portfolio basis, assume as part of our reserve an amount to withdraw diversified across a credit book. As it relates specifically to energy, we are obviously looking credit-by-credit, what might be drawn, what the reserve redetermination is going to do on all of the above. But remember inside of the generic reserving process, we have a factor as does everybody else that assumes some amount of draw and it's a function of type of client collateral, a whole bunch of different factors that go into the modeling for that.","Rob Reilly","Yes. I think that's a good way to put it, that it is done on an individual basis and reserved in energy and reserved appropriately.","Bill Carcache","That's very helpful. Thanks guys. That's all I had.","Brian Gill","Next question, please.","Operator","There are no further questions on the phone lines, sir.","Brian Gill","Great. Thank you, operator and thank you all very much for joining us on this quarter's conference call.","Bill Demchak","Thanks a lot, everybody.","Rob Reilly","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Edison, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The PNC Financial Services Group Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bryan Gill. Sir, please go ahead.","Bryan Gill","Thank you, Edison, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's conference call for The PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO. ","Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These materials are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of July 17, 2019, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.","William Demchak","Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. As you've seen this morning, PNC reported net income of $1.4 billion or $2.88 per diluted common share for the second quarter. By virtually, every measure, it was a successful quarter. You saw we generated really strong growth in loans and deposits. We grew total revenues, both NII and noninterest income increased, managed expenses well, generated positive operating leverage and delivered strong returns. Building on the strong first quarter, we're pleased where we sit on performance through the first half of this year. Credit quality remains strong. We continue to see no cracks really on either the commercial or the consumer side. ","Our loan growth this quarter continued to be driven by the commercial side, but we did see growth in consumer as well. And inside of our strong commercial loan growth, we saw a drop in yields, consistent with lower interest rates, LIBOR sets basically and some further spread compression. The effect was particularly impactful on the margin this quarter. ","At the same time, we continue to have great success in cross-selling fee-based products to these clients and our economic profit on the total relationships continues to be really healthy. Pipelines are solid going into the third quarter. Sales on our Corporate Banking segment in June actually tied a month a record high, and treasury management and capital markets revenue also set quarterly records. ","In terms of market expansion, we continue to generate strong results in C&IB with our new markets, and we will take our middle market Corporate Banking franchise into two additional markets next year with moves into both Portland and Seattle. ","On the retail side, our national digital expansion effort continued to make good progress this quarter. Our high-yield savings product continues to be an attractive entry point for new customers in our expansion markets and beyond. And we've now opened 3 new branch locations under our solution center model in Kansas City and Dallas to support our digital offerings and outreach in our expansion markets. And we've been very pleased to see the growth in those branches. They are growing at nearly 5x the pace we'd expect for a de novo branch in our legacy markets. Looking ahead, we plan to accelerate the pace of new solution center openings over the next 18 months or so in Boston, Dallas, Houston and Nashville. ","We continue to return capital to shareholders even as we maintained a strong capital position. I'm sure you've seen we've recently announced a 21% increase in our quarterly cash dividend on common stock, raising the dividend to $1.15 per share on top of a substantial increase in our share repurchase programs. And as we look at the current environment and the remainder of the year ahead, there's obviously some uncertainty in the economy and the outlook for rates. That, of course, is beyond our control, but we will continue to invest in our businesses, particularly in customer-facing innovation to keep improving the customer experience and further expand our product and service offerings to meet our customers' evolving needs. ","As always, I want to thank our employees for their continued hard work, and with that, I'll turn it over to Rob to take you through our second quarter results in a little more detail.","Robert Reilly","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill just mentioned, we reported second quarter net income of $1.4 billion or $2.88 per diluted common share. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. Average total loans grew $6.3 billion or 3% to approximately $235 billion linked quarter. Loan growth compared to second quarter of 2018 was $12.2 billion or 5%. Investment securities of $83.6 billion increased $1.3 billion or 2%, primarily due to purchases of agency RMBS. ","Securities increased $6.1 billion or 8% year-over-year. Our cash balances at the Fed averaged $13.2 billion for the second quarter, down $1.5 billion linked quarter and $7.5 billion year-over-year. Deposits grew $5.7 billion or 2% linked quarter and $11.9 billion or 5% year-over-year. As of June 30, 2019, our Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated to be 9.7%, compared with 9.8% as of March 31, 2019. Our tangible book value was $80.76 per common share as of June 30, an increase of 12% compared to a year ago. ","Our return on average assets for the second quarter was 1.39%, up 5 basis points from the first quarter. And our return on tangible common equity was 14.82%, an increase of 69 basis points. ","Slide 5 shows our loans and deposits in more detail. Average loans grew $6.3 billion or 3% over the first quarter, with broad-based growth in both commercial and consumer lending. Commercial lending balances increased $5.4 billion or 3% linked quarter, with particularly strong growth in our secured lending portfolio. ","On the consumer side, balances increased approximately $900 million or 1% linked quarter, with growth in residential real estate, auto and credit card, somewhat offset by runoff in our home equity and education loans. Compared to the same period a year ago, average loans increased 5% or $12.2 billion. ","Average deposits increased approximately $5.7 billion in the second quarter compared with the first quarter, reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer deposits. The growth was primarily In interest-bearing deposits, however, average noninterest-bearing deposits posted a small increase as well. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, average deposits increased by $11.9 billion or 5%. ","As you can see on Slide 5, our capital return to shareholders has been substantial over the past several years through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, while maintaining an overall strong capital position. In the second quarter, we completed the common stock repurchase programs we announced last year. And last month, we announced a new plan to repurchase up to $4.3 billion of shares over the next 4 quarters. This represents a 48% increase over our recently completed share repurchase programs. Additionally, last week our Board of Directors approved a 21% increase in the quarterly dividend to an all-time high of $1.15 per share effective with the August dividend. ","As you can see on Slide 6, first quarter total revenue was $4.4 billion, up $153 million linked quarter or 4%. Net interest income was up $23 million or 1% compared with the first quarter. ","Noninterest income increased $130 million or 7% linked quarter, reflecting seasonally higher fee income as well as an increase in other noninterest income. Noninterest expense increased $33 million or 1% compared with the first quarter as expenses continued to be well managed. Provision for credit losses in the second quarter was $180 million, a $9 million linked quarter decrease. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 16.6%. For the full year 2019, we continue to expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 17%. ","Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. ","Turning to Slide 7. Net interest income of $2.5 billion was up $23 million or 1% compared with the first quarter. The increase reflects higher loan balances as well as an additional day in the quarter, partially offset by lower commercial loan yield and higher interest-bearing liability balances. Net interest income grew $85 million or 4% year-over-year, driven by higher earning asset yields and balances, which were partially offset by higher funding costs and balances. Net interest margin decreased to 2.91% in the second quarter. The primary driver of this decline was commercial loan yields, which were impacted by a decrease in LIBOR rates as well as narrower spreads. Additionally, deposit rates increased 5 basis points during the quarter. Noninterest income increased 7% linked quarter and 2% year-over-year. Importantly, fee income grew 5% linked quarter with increases across all fee categories. The main drivers of the $71 million linked quarter fee increase were: asset management revenue, which includes our equity investment in BlackRock and increased $8 million reflecting higher average equity markets. ","Consumer services increased $21 million and service charges on deposits increased $3 million due to seasonally higher transaction volumes and customer growth. Corporate services increased $22 million, driven by higher treasury management product revenue and loan syndication fees. And residential mortgage noninterest income increased $17 million due to higher loan sales revenue and a positive RMSR valuation adjustments, partially offset by lower servicing revenue. ","Finally, other noninterest income increased $59 million linked quarter, reflecting higher capital-markets related revenue, including a record quarter in our corporate securities business and asset sale and valuation gains. Second quarter other noninterest income included a gain on the sale of the retirement recordkeeping business, which was announced in the first quarter and was included in our second quarter guidance. In the third quarter, we expect other noninterest income to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million, excluding net securities and Visa activity. This reflects our expectation for lower asset sale gains compared with the second quarter. ","Turning to Slide 9. Second quarter expenses increased 1% for both the linked quarter and year-over-year comparisons, as our expenses remained well controlled. The largest percentage increase was in our marketing expense, which supports our national retail digital strategies. Our efficiency ratio improved to 59% in the second quarter, compared with 60% for both last quarter and a year ago. Expense management continues to be a focus for us, and we remain disciplined in our overall approach. As you know, we have a goal to realize $300 million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program, and we are on track to achieve our full year 2019 target. ","Our credit quality metrics are presented on Slide 10. Overall, our credit quality remains strong, and we continue to see strength broadly in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. Provision for credit losses was $180 million, a $9 million decrease linked quarter. Net charge-offs increased $6 million to $142 million linked quarter, and our annualized net charge-off ratio was unchanged at 24 basis points. ","Overall, our allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans was 1.15% as of June 30, 2019, virtually unchanged from the previous 4 quarters. Nonperforming loans were up $71 million or 4%, driven by the commercial portfolio. Total nonperforming loans to total loans represent 73 basis points, a small increase in the quarter, but down year-over-year. Total delinquencies were down $127 million or 9% linked quarter, reflecting a decline in both commercial and consumer delinquencies. As you know, we're approaching the adoption of CECL, the new accounting standard for credit losses, which will go into effect January 1, 2020. We've been in parallel run since the beginning of this year, and based on our expectation of forecasted economic conditions and portfolio balances as of June 30, 2019, we estimate that CECL could result in an overall allowance increase of 15% to 25% as compared to our current aggregate reserve levels. ","The majority of the increase is expected to be driven by the consumer loan portfolio, as longer duration assets require more reserves under the CECL methodology. Importantly, these are still estimates at this point, and we will continue to refine them through the balance of 2019. ","In summary, PNC posted very good second quarter results, which contributed to an overall strong first half of 2019. For the balance of this year, we expect continued growth in GDP, albeit at a slower pace over the second half of 2019. We now expect two 25 basis point cuts in the Fed funds rate in 2019, one in July and one in October. Looking ahead to third quarter 2019 compared to second quarter 2019 reported results, we expect average loans to be up approximately 1%. We expect total net interest income to be stable. We expect fee income to be up low single digits. We expect other noninterest income to be between $250 million and $300 million, excluding net securities and Visa activity. We expect expenses to be stable, and we expect provision to be between $150 million and $200 million. ","Turning to Slide 12 and taking into account our third quarter guidance, we've also liked to take this opportunity to reaffirm our full year outlook. ","Our income statement guidance remains intact and we are increasing our outlook for average loan growth based on the strong performance we've experienced in the first half of the year. We're now expecting full year average loans to be up approximately 5%. We expect the net interest income benefit of this incremental loan growth to partially offset the lower-than-expected rate environment, which will support our ability to achieve our original full year revenue target. Importantly, in the first half of 2019, we generated positive operating leverage and remain well-positioned to deliver positive operating leverage for the full year of 2019. And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.","Bryan Gill","Edison, could you poll for questions, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.","John Pancari","On your guidance for the full year, and it's good to see the revenue outlook unchanged despite the rate backdrop. So is it -- I'm wondering if you could break out that revenue expectation of -- at the higher end of the low single digit between what your expectation would be for the full year for NII versus fees? Because it seems like likely that your fee outlook is improving here and helping keep that revenue outlook unchanged in the backdrop of the lower rate environment.","Robert Reilly","Yes, yes, yes. John, this is Rob. I think when you take a look at in terms of our full year guidance what we originally expected, we said the upper end of the low single digits, probably at that time a little more NII and a little less in noninterest income. Fast-forward to today, accounting for the now a rate environment where we expect declining rates, so we'd see the NII back off a little bit than the noninterest income pickup. NII is not done as much as it would be as I pointed out in my comments because of the higher-than-expected loan growth. So probably a little bit more to answer your question, probably a little bit more equal contribution both from NII and noninterest income.","William Demchak","So it is clear that what Rob saying NII down a little bit, it's relative to our guide.","Robert Reilly","Expectation. Yes, of our original expectation. That's right.","John Pancari","Right. Got it. Okay. And then as it pertains to NII, can you give us a little bit more granularity on what you -- how you see the margin trending? I know previously you looked for a couple bps impact through the remainder of the year, but curious what your expectation is now that you're looking for cuts? And then also what would be the NII or NIM impact of 25 basis point cut? Just curious on your rate sensitivity.","William Demchak","We could both jump in. This is a bit of a weird quarter, John, because -- that the LIBOR sets kind of got in front of the expectation that the Fed is going to cut. So we had that drop in loan yields that wasn't really offset by any drop in deposit rates and other things. So I don't know that you're going to see a drop like you saw this quarter Interestingly, all of what we saw or virtually all that was on the asset side as opposed to the liability side of our balance sheet. So I think going forward, we do have two cuts in the forecast. You'll still see NIM under pressure, but it shouldn't be at all like the drop we saw this quarter. Having said all that, there's a million caveats to mix and other things in there that affect that.","Robert Reilly","I think I can add to that just in simple terms. This quarter, interest-bearing assets were down largely driven down by commercial loan yields. And on the liability side, we actually went up 1 basis point because even though borrowings came down, the deposit rates were up. So going forward, we...","William Demchak","And the deposit rates were up because of mix shift not because of betas.","Robert Reilly","Yes. That's right. And competitive factors. So going forward we see the liabilities be more in tandem. So less compression to Bill's point. And then on the NII itself, in terms of the approximate amount relative to the 2 cuts that we have, we approximate that to be about $100 million.","William Demchak","Relative to our...","Robert Reilly","Yes. Relative to what it would've been the cuts...","William Demchak","If we can get the cut...","Robert Reilly","Together, that's right.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.","John McDonald","The loan growth came in [Technical Difficulty] a little more color on where things have been picking up [Technical Difficulty] versus the legacy?","Bryan Gill","John, you're breaking up a little bit. You there? Okay. Go to the next question. We'll see if he comes back.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","I wanted to understand a little bit more about the loan growth that you generated this quarter. I mean you guys are known for being very conservative and careful, and this is really eye-popping growth. So just wanted to understand what the drivers were, in particular on the C&I side? And what kind of legs do you think this has? Just want to see if this was a really unusual quarter or if there's more to come?","Robert Reilly","Yes. Betsy, it's Rob, I can start this. We did have a -- we had a great record in terms of loan growth, as you've mentioned, largely on the commercial side, a little consumer growth was good too. On the commercial, I think it was a bit elevated in the second quarter. The big -- and the primary drivers of our loan growth, which we'd expect to continue maybe now at the same rate, we are in new geographies, all of which are doing well. And then in this quarter, similar to what we've been seeing for the last couple of years really, strong growth in our secured lending segment, which has better competitive dynamics. So those 2 things happened in the quarter and then on top of that, we had strong growth in some high-quality commercial, just general commercial credit. So little bit more in the second quarter than we'd expect going forward, which is why we guide to 1% loan growth in the third quarter, but those fundamentals are still in place.","William Demchak","Yes. And it's -- we haven't changed the risk bucket. Actually the quality of what we've been originating on average has been better...","Robert Reilly","Higher.","William Demchak","Over the course of the first half of this year than it was last year.","Betsy Graseck","That's interesting because we've seen in some of the data a little weakness in the manufacturing, transportation area, energy and those are big borrowers. So is there any -- is there other industries that's really driving the bus for you than this?","William Demchak","It's pretty diversified. The one thing that's in there is we did see some pickup in utilization this quarter, which helps a little bit, particularly in the asset-based lending book. Although, I would say that it actually came down in June, so it's -- I don't know that that's a strength that necessarily continues, but it was broad-based, it's new clients, the new. I don't remember the stat up the top of my head, Rob, but the new markets are growing at multiples...","Robert Reilly","Multiples, yes. Very high percentages off a small base but clearly,.","William Demchak","Adding materially to the balances. So strengths are just working. They are doing a good job.","Betsy Graseck","And do you feel like that is in part because of your size going into these new markets? Folks are looking for somebody a little bit larger that can take down bigger bites? Is that part of it? Maybe you can speak to the quality of the loans that you're doing? Is it more like cash flow, asset-based? Or is it the fund buybacks and M&A?","William Demchak","Remember that asset-based business has been national for years. We're not actually counting that when we talk about our new market growth. So most of the market growth is coming from our traditional middle-market products. It's not differentiated by risk. The cross-sell ratio in the new markets is accelerating quickly and approaching legacy markets. So we're just executing well. And I don't know how else to explain it. They're doing a good job.","Robert Reilly","Those new markets that we do in our legacy markets. We know how to compete. We don't win them all though we win our fair share.","Operator","And we will try with Mr. John McDonald from Autonomous Research.","John McDonald","I'll move on to the next topic. Got a big authorization on the CCAR with the buyback. I guess, Bill, just kind of wonder about your philosophy there. Some banks front-load, others are more opportunistic. How you're going to approach executing the buyback?","William Demchak","We spread it through time. You can't really front-load it anyway. You forget the exact growth but...","Robert Reilly","In terms -- yes, in terms of our plan going forward as what we've done in the past years, which is pretty much evenly distributed throughout the year. Some others have front-loaded but that's part of their submission. We're opting to do otherwise.","John McDonald","Okay. And then, Rob, you'll obviously get some benefit based on the tailoring proposal. Have you guys done any fine-tuning of the estimates of how much that could help on the capital fund if the tailoring goes through as proposed?","Robert Reilly","Yes. Yes, John, we have, and again, this is proposed that -- the quick answer is about 65 basis points on our CET 1 ratio. That's down a little bit from the last time. We're asked that question mostly because AOCI has changed around. So 65 basis points is a good estimate.","John McDonald","And is that pretty much all BlackRock then as the benefit...","Robert Reilly","Pretty much. Yes, the threshold deduction.","Bryan Gill","[Indiscernible] as well as threshold deduction.","Robert Reilly","BlackRock is the biggest piece. Bryan is right. The other components MSR and DTAs are down a little bit but BlackRock is the big piece.","John McDonald","Okay. And then just on the credit quality, Rob, anything to note there? The NPAs are up a touch. Is that just kind of lumpy stuff going on there? Overall credit looks good, just maybe a comment there.","Robert Reilly","Yes. That's our view, John. Just a couple of deals coming off of really, really low levels last year. So when you take a look at the percentages to the total loan portfolio, they are virtually unchanged. We had a couple deals on the commercial side. go to the NPA list, one of which went to the top there that we've disclosed. But they are unrelated and have instances and circumstances that mitigate what would be further broader concerns.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","As I think about deposit strategy in the midst of rate cuts, could you share with us what kind of sensitivity you assume as you think about mitigating the first few rate cuts? And are you going to continue to separately think about your expansion markets in terms of pricing versus your legacy markets?","William Demchak","You take the first.","Robert Reilly","Yes, sure. I can start on that. Obviously, going forward in the declining rate environment, we'll keep an eye in terms of our deposit rates. And if we do get the cuts that are proposed, it's likely that our rates would either, subject to competitive pressures, stable or go down. I think in regard to the national retail digital strategy, the deposits, although they've increased nicely percentage-wise, they're still pretty small relative to our total deposits. So we'll remain pretty aggressive there in terms of the rates that we pay. But of course, that will be largely subject to the rate environment and the competitive pressures.","William Demchak","I think practically betas lagged on the way up there so they don't have as much -- we don't have as much to go down. The national market is interesting. If you post in the top couple rates, you gather lots of deposits. If you're off that frontier, it slows down. And our strategy right now isn't actually to go out and try to grow those deposits aggressively. Instead, it's to go out and learn exactly the dynamics of how marketing dollars spent give you a return on your investment and the combination of marketing dollars and the physical branch presence effects volume. So you won't see as a practical matter, I don't think rate impact causing anything -- rate impact having -- causing any change in our national expansion in the near term because we're still on the stage of kind of figuring out the levers that drive success in that effort. Elsewhere inside the deposits, we're going to drop rates subject to what the market does.","Erika Najarian","That's very helpful. And as a follow-up, as you think about studying those new markets and how you enter those markets, is that affirming the decision that we're really in a digitally initiated world and therefore, the value of the traditional brick-and-mortar acquisition for someone like PNC is much lower, particularly if it's small in size?","William Demchak","A couple of things that are showing up very clearly to us. The branch builds that we're putting in place are much more successful, dramatically more successful than we'd resumed and they affect the quality of the customer that you actually book online. So our bias, and I have that in my comments, is probably to go with more branch builds that we'd originally assumed in our national expansion. The other thing that's very clear is that this online market is growing. We can measure deposits that leave us to go to competitors as well as the deposits that come to us and it's very clear that through time, at least in my mind, this is going to take a greater, greater portion of the market and for banking to be profitable as you see mix shift interest-bearing from noninterest-bearing and the margin on interest-bearing declining in effect for banking to be profitable. You're going to continue to see this branch spending in our saturated markets which we've talked about as we build out the fin. So I think this is in motion, not just for us, but for the whole industry. And I don't think there's anything that's going to slow it down.","Erika Najarian","Got it. I think it was unclear on my last question. I think you're loud and clear that the branch experience enhances the customer acquisition. I meant more that the organic build seems more valuable than the traditional tuck-in depository deal?","William Demchak","Oh, yes, ma'am.","Robert Reilly","Got it. Thank you. Go ahead. .","Robert Reilly","Are you going to add to that or...","William Demchak","No. I was just -- that math becomes -- it's fairly straightforward. The small deposits or institutions are trading at multiples of book value.","Robert Reilly","And that was one of the things that we wanted to test with this and it is proving out that way.","William Demchak","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill and Partners.","Robert Siefers","Rob, I guess first just kind of a housekeeping one. The retirement recordkeeping business, can you maybe quantify the size of the gain that was in other income? I guess in a sense, it does matter since you've given guide for other income...","Robert Reilly","I can help you a little bit of the math and you will be able to do yourself when you take a look at the AMG segment information. The gain on the sale of the business was -- came in two components. One was a $60 million gain in other noninterest income. Associated with the transaction was $20 million of expenses. The primary driver of that was the right-off of the software of our own administered system that was not part of the sale. So a net $40 million gain. And again, you could see that very clearly in the AMG segment info in terms of elevated revenue and expenses. And it was -- and as you pointed out, it was part of our second quarter guidance.","Robert Siefers","Yes. All right. And then maybe, Bill, just sort of a broader question. If the Fed indeed does go into this rate-cutting mode, can you talk a bit about what you think sort of the stimulative impact if any would be on your customers? I guess on the consumer side, it's a little more self-evident. But as it relates to your commercial customers, I mean would it generate any change in demand or how are you or your customers thinking about that dynamic?","William Demchak","I don't know that I have any insight into that in theory that's why they would do it. It's a practical matter. I continue to think we're on a -- we have really low rates today. So I struggle to see how another 25 basis points or 50 basis points actually is going to impact what is already pretty low cost of funding for people. But we'll see.","Robert Reilly","And psychological aspect of that sometimes.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Bill, Rob. Bill, you talked a couple of times about the success of the solution branches outside your footprint and they're growing much faster than expected. What are you finding as the reason for that success?","William Demchak","I don't know.","Gerard Cassidy","That's fair answer. Okay.","William Demchak","I think part of it Is we designed them purposely to be different in terms of the numbers of employees and types of employees. So the employees in those branches spend more time than a traditional branch outside of the branch. So they're out working, events and neighborhoods and centers of influence more than you would see in a traditional branch. I think the advertising that is in play in these markets makes people aware of us and our offer and I still think that particularly for large deposits, branches matter. Somebody says, look, it's a great offer but I'm willing to drive the 20 minutes to go see somebody face-to-face rather than do it digitally. That has -- that's kind of common sense but I think that's been -- has had a stronger impact than I otherwise would've suspected.","Gerard Cassidy","And then circling back to the strong C&I loan growth outside your tradition footprint, obviously from what you've said you're not selling -- or making the loans at prices that are completely different than your competition or underwriting standards. The guys on the frontline and are making -- building these relationships for you folks in the C&I area, what are they telling you, why people are coming, again I'm assuming it's not just the loan, is that the treasury management products that you have, which everybody knows are very strong or what's bringing these people to you guys if it's not pricing or underwriting?","William Demchak","First, John, you have to remember that we're just kind of starting to see the roll-on of this new business as we've been in these markets for a couple of years. Our strategy is just to call on people, sometimes for several years before we get any business. When we go into a market, we figure out who we want to have as customers and then we just focus on them for however long it takes. What you're seeing in terms of our results is what Mike Lyons [ph] calls it the wave but basically kind of this catch-up of the investments we've made is we're starting to see growth come from 3 years of planting seeds. If you remember all the way back when we bought RBC, we kind of did the same thing, right? We planted seeds and that effort came alive 2 and 3 years later and that's what you're seeing now. So it's traditional clients. I would tell you that TM makes a big difference. Our ability to go in and cross-sell when you -- more often than not you end up leading with capital with credit as part of your intro, the relationship and as you pursue cross-sell, we just have more to offer in terms of variety of products for treasurers and CFOs to choose from. We have good products, and it's worked for us.","Robert Reilly","Yes, Gerard, I'd add to that that I agree with that but what I'd add is that what we found is the receptivity of potential clients in all these geographies to a PNC calling effort has been very high which 20 years ago was difficult. But the receptivity is very high and once the dialogue occurs, it's all the point that Bill pointed out. We tend to compete very well with our products and services.","Gerard Cassidy","And then just lastly, your federal reserve balances obviously are down year-over-year quite nicely. How low can they go before they just have to be maintained? Or are you there already?","Robert Reilly","Well, so I think -- so how low can we go? That's a good question. I think we're...","William Demchak","I think it's a function of LCR that we can go down to 0 if you wanted to put out that stuff into Level 1 securities.","Robert Reilly","That's right. That's right.","William Demchak","One of the issues you saw this quarter was we actually changed the mix on balance of our securities a bit to 2A, which otherwise would have allowed us to have either less wholesale borrowings and\/or drop the balance more.","Robert Reilly","Yes. I think that's all true. I think we're essentially at the levels that we expect to be at. What I would point out though as part the tailoring proposals as a possible reduction in the LCR levels and if that occurs, we could go down substantially. Our math is as much as maybe $10 billion our $20 billion depending on what whether it's 70% or 85% leverage.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew O'Connor","I know the period on balances can whip around a little bit but I'm just wondering if we look at the securities portfolio, the cash you had, a pretty big increase there that seems like it's being funded with wholesale and just trying to think through like if that -- as you think about your interest rate positioning or your pre-fundings and some your securities or is it just some of that period of noise that I'm overthinking?","William Demchak","Yes, there is some mix shift between the average and the spot at period end, but you are correct that we did, because we added some 2A securities, we funded that with home loan advances actually and so you see that jump. That's all inside of our rate management process. We saw value in largely certain types of MBS this quarter and took advantage of it.","Robert Reilly","Yes.","Matthew O'Connor","Okay. And I guess -- I think there's a view out there that the rate curve is maybe overly ambitious in terms of predicting rate cuts. And I think folks are still trying to keep some dry powder. But if the rate cuts don't materialize or they reverse quickly, which could happen, how would you think about managing the balance sheet and some of securities and some of the actions that you've taken here to what seems like reduce the assets and [indiscernible]?","William Demchak","You shouldn't confuse the increase in balances with an assumption that we simply added duration. It's maybe the best way I could answer that question. We saw what we think were irrational prices on certain types of securities that offered a fairly protected return inside of fairly wide rate moves. If rates stay where they are, we don't see -- we, in fact, follow the forward curve, there's not a whole lot of reason to want to add duration at this point. Obviously, if -- because like you, I don't believe that forward curve. If that reverses, then we'll take a look at it and there's opportunity there.","Robert Reilly","But nothing radical.","William Demchak","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin Barker","Last quarter, you guys mentioned that you had some expense leverage you could pull if there was a lot of pressure on rates and if that were to continue. Are you still seeing some flexibility on the expense side if possible in order to continue to generate operating leverage, given the current rate environment?","Robert Reilly","Kevin, this is Rob. I'm not sure what the levers that we were talking about before, we had to look on the script. But I'll answer in the sense that you know we do manage a positive operating leverage. We've had a good first half, solid -- positive operating leverage and we expect to deliver full year positive operating leverage and that's what we managed too. So on the expense side, I feel good about it in terms of what we've managed. If you just go through the categories, our personnel expense is up 2%, which is consistent with merit. That contrasts to where we were this time last year where we're making a lot of investments in personnel, it was much higher. Occupancy is essentially flat. Equipment expense is up just a little bit reflecting our technology investments. Marketing is up. That's deliberate, discretionary and part of our build-out and we expect to continue to that. But the real savings has been in the all other category, which is our second largest behind personnel, which is down year-over-year. That's where our CIP program shows up the most. So I feel good about our expense management what we've done so far this year and what we plan to do for the balance.","Kevin Barker","Okay. And then let's shift gears back to some of the loan growth comments. I mean consumer loan growth was a focus for you and has consistently lagged the commercial loan growth. Is there anything there that we can see that maybe developed on the consumer side that will maybe start to emerge and maybe diversify your balance sheet a little bit more between commercial and consumer lending?","William Demchak","I don't think so. I mean the places we are growing are actually growing at reasonable percentages off of smaller balances because we haven't been that larger consumer. They're being offset by the continued rundown of home equity and student lending, which masks some of the underlying growth. But at the end of the day, our consumer loan growth is always in effect, I shouldn't always but practically always is going to be slower than C&I, simply because it's on a much smaller base. And by the way, if you see a dramatic change in that then you ought to start asking questions. We're growing it at I think an appropriate pace off the base we're in with the products we have as we increase penetration with the clients we have. But I don't know that you'd see a dramatic turn.","Robert Reilly","I don't think it'll be dramatic, but just to add to that. Card and auto are growing nicely and that's all part of our plan. Residential mortgages are up and that's a function of just higher client activity, particularly in the jumbo space. One day the home equity run-off will stop running off, and then we'll get the benefit of that, but the fact that's the plan.","Kevin Barker","Longer term or more broadly, do you view having a more balanced commercial versus consumer lending book as ideal or do you feel comfortable with the way it is right now, 70-30 give or take?","William Demchak","So look optically because we are light on and consumer, we screen poorly on efficiency ratio and some other things and our NIM is lower because our loan yields are lower. That doesn't have anything to do with true economics but optically people screen and say we're perhaps doing something wrong. The only way to materially change that would be through some sort of acquisition of some type and we aren't -- just as a site. Consumer lenders who for -- who come for sale typically have some sort of big problem and we're kind of necessarily...","Robert Reilly","To sit in that...","William Demchak","The people to fix a consumer lending problem. I'd probably answer that differently if it was the C&I problem. So I don't see that we have either the need economically or the opportunity to dramatically change that mix, given where we're starting from.","Robert Reilly","Nor do we want to slow down the high-quality commercial growth, which we're good at.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.","Michael Mayo","I just wanted to follow-up more on the solution center expansion and understand your thought process a little bit more. I thought going back a few years, you were looking at a market digital-only expansion and you called that an experiment. So should we take from this that now as you expand out of market, you're only doing that with the solution centers? And how many solution centers do you think you need in each of these markets to have the critical mass that you -- that's necessary?","William Demchak","That's a fair question, Mike. It's -- we always talked about going out digitally thin and building branches, largely following our C&I expansion. What's changed is we're going to build more than we had originally assumed. So in Dallas, if I was thinking 5, we're now thinking 10 or 15. Those are soft numbers. Having said all that, of course, national digital is national and in markets where we have no presence, and in fact, some of our greatest growth is coming from parts of the country where we don't have any presence in C&I or retail and we don't intend to build branches. So it will be a mix. All I'm suggesting here is that certain markets where we had -- where we thought we'd build a couple of branches, it's becoming clear that you can actually get a higher return in those markets by building more branches and I don't know if that's a function of just better brand presence, a higher return on your marketing or exactly what's driving it, but that's exactly why we're doing test and learn in all these different places with different levers to see what gives us the most economic growth.","Michael Mayo","And I mean just how you frame who you are? I mean when I go to your website, it doesn't say that you're a national retail bank. So is your intention to be across the country with solution centers? I mean you highlighted, I guess four cities here along with [indiscernible].","William Demchak","That's interesting, I didn't know that was on or website. I'm going to change that this afternoon.","Michael Mayo","It says the east, it says the midwest, it says the southeast and that's...","William Demchak","Yes, you know, I think traditionally, of course, we're following where we have physical footprint. It's a practical matter, Mike. Our ambition is to be a national retail bank. The form that that takes for us and for everybody continues to evolve. My own belief is that over time that will involve having physical presence in all the MSAs in this country done over whatever period of time as we continue to thin are saturated markets. I don't have a timeline on when that plays out, but I have this -- or we have this belief that fundamentally if you sit in your existing region and simply try to protect your region while you have the large banks coming in, so Bank of America and JPMorgan are in Pittsburgh. If I simply sit and protect Pittsburgh, I will lose because they will take share. And therefore, we have to go out and compete in markets where they have share today and we pull share. If you sit in your existing region, you will atrophy through time. And so our strategy is to go national.","Michael Mayo","And when you say physical presence in all MSAs, you mean like the top 50, top 20, top 100 and...","William Demchak","Yes, yes. To be the term but assume that it's a top 50. But all of that is it -- that is In next year's plan. It is in the year after that. But the practical outcome of the transformation you're seeing in banking with more and more is done digitally. The bigger banks are getting larger, the inability to simply defend a regional footprint, in my view, on a cost-efficient basis suggests that you need to reach the whole country and pull share where you can pull share. That's what we're going to do over time. It will evolve as we go and that's why we're doing the test and learn we're doing today so we don't do a massive spend and then have to relay it back in.","Michael Mayo","And then last follow-up. I mean this is very helpful. Why not -- isn't it tougher if you don't have the brand name outside of the market? I mean some of the largest banks are already known when they go into market, whereas PNC going into, I don't know, what you have here, Houston, Dallas, it's not going to be as well-known on the retail side and then why not just jump-start the whole process and buy a bank? I mean everybody says we're not going to buy a bank, we're not going to buy a bank but National City or Annual Report highlights a decade later that was a success. So why not accelerate this kind of national retail bank ambition with an acquisition?","William Demchak","I'm not exactly sure what that has to do with brand because the brand build ultimately comes from spend in the local market and national markets as well. But you could most definitely accelerate share through an acquisition. It issue and you've heard me talk about this, Mike, if you buy the small bank, you're getting a lot of stuff you really don't want at a multiple of book value. We want the accounts but we more often than not don't want to have anything to do with the balance sheet and the branches that you get are in the wrong place with the wrong technology, with the wrong style and the wrong employees. So it's just not a return on. I wish there was. If you jump up in scale -- look, if there was another National City less than book value that we could -- then, of course, we would do it, but that's a value question. Yes, that would accelerate what we're doing, but today at today's prices and today's opportunities, it's a much, much lower return than doing what we're doing.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.","Brian Klock","Rob, a quick follow-up question on the guidance. Around revenue for the full year, it seems like taking the first half of the year and the guidance for the third quarter, it seems like the fourth quarter would imply somewhere around $140 million, $150 million of revenue higher than the third quarter guide. So I think you have in there -- there's probably the gain in there related to the mutual fund business as part of your selling to federate it? Is there anything else in there? Or is that -- I think there was like a $52 million sale price if I remember correctly.","Robert Reilly","Yes. So let me just take a shot at [indiscernible] so I think the spirit of your question is, we stand by our guidance and feel confident around that. There is some volatility in that other noninterest income number and that's nothing new and tends to average out over the course of the year. So in the second quarter, it was a bit elevated because of all the reasons that I mentioned in addition to the sale of the retirement business. So it ran a little bit higher than what we expected. And that was included in our guidance. So when I look at the third quarter guidance, how I do that is I combine what I see in the next 90 days along with patterns that tend to emerge and then beyond that, I go by the patterns. So probably a little bit less in the third quarter in other noninterest income that we had in the second quarter and then in the fourth quarter, to your point, we do have a sale of the mutual fund business that we've announced that will be in there that will otherwise elevate that number. So you are on the right track. Yes.","Brian Klock","And in the rest that you -- like you said you had some good capital markets business, so that other piece of it could just be some of the seasonality that might go through?","Robert Reilly","Yes. That's right.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez","I wanted to get your perspective on sort of the trajectory of deposit cost, deposit betas on the way down. Obviously, deposit betas were low on the way up, you can make the argument that they will be low on the way down, but also wanted your perspective on the timing of when we actually see that rate cuts start to filter into interest-bearing deposit cost. Because historically, if I look at the data, there's usually a quarter or 2 quarter lag between when the Fed cuts and when you actually start to see the benefit in deposit cost and there's even a little bit of lag in terms of when deposit migration stops happening into interest-bearing accounts. So how do I -- if we were to see a July cut, how quickly do you think it actually filters into your deposit -- your overall deposit cost? Is there 1 or 2 quarter lag? Or do you feel like you should be able to see that filter into the deposit cost, which I think was 103 basis points this quarter?","William Demchak","Remember, the wholesale C&I deposit rates will kind of drop instantaneously. So we're really talking about what happens in retail. And I think you will see it take effect, all else equal, pretty quickly. The one thing that concerns me a little bit is if you look at the entire industry there are people who have been pushing on loan-to-deposit ratios, protecting NIM by effectively allowing deposits to run off and they're now trying to reverse that. So competition for deposits, even as rates drop could continue as we've seen loan growth outpace deposit growth for most of the middle-sized banks for a period of time now. So that's kind of the unknown in my mind in terms of what actually happens to consumer deposit cost.","Robert Reilly","And just to add to that, it'll be driven more by competitive pressures rather than the banks' abilities to move quickly.","William Demchak","Yes.","Saul Martinez","And do you think the greater importance of online banks, digital banks today than we've had in the past also plays into that and maybe limits the ability or willingness of banks to reduce costs, especially on the consumer side?","William Demchak","I think it does. I think we have seen the impact of online banks on deposit growth and mix generally. And I think that's going to have an impact not just on -- if rates go down, but as we roll forward increasingly over time. I think you'll see betas actually be faster and faster because the online bank rate is more deposits bank rate towards that becomes real-time. I don't have a timeline for that. I just -- it's happening. You can't ignore it.","Saul Martinez","Right. Quick follow-up on commercial credit. Obviously, you made clear that the uptick in NPAs you're not overly worried about that. But are there any segments or geographies or size of companies that you feel have a little bit more strain? Is there anything you're keeping a closer eye out or in terms of potential credit weakness?","William Demchak","It's the traditional stuff. There is some real estate on the margin. On the retail side that everybody's talked about, but it's fine. There's -- transportation companies are struggling for a variety of costs at the margin, but we're not overly exposed to this. It's just a -- there's a bunch of little stuff, but there's nothing inside of -- to Rob's point, I went through every single ad to our watch list and they all had their own idiosyncratic story, all in separate industries, all with a reasonable explanation that largely had nothing to do with the economy. ","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth Usdin","Just one follow-up on tailoring. So, Bill, having heard all the comments already made about just long-term environment for the sector, how would you start to prioritize the potential benefits from that capital free-up, if even you go forward and say, there is no value opportunities for traditional banks? How do you start to strategize and prioritize about what the best and incremental uses of that capital if a deal is not the right amount -- the right usage at that time?","William Demchak","Well, I think -- look, you're going to get the standard answer. Of course, we invest in our business and we've been investing a lot in our business for the last multiple period of years and that will continue. But we have an ability for the foreseeable future, in my view, to generate capital in excess of what we can intelligently deploy in growth. And so we get into a question of dividend and share buyback and, I guess -- I would suggest you just look at our actions this year to foreshadow the way we think about this, and what we might be doing going forward.","Kenneth Usdin","Yes. And is there anything left in the kit that you don't have on the nonbank side that you've been getting out of some businesses as you've called up and streamlined some other things? But is there anything that you're still looking forward to deepening? Or the aspects of things that you don't have that you still need to offer as you're getting round out that product offering?","William Demchak","There's a lot of stuff we look at, at the margin inside of payments, and other things we're doing in the C&I space on advisory. The issue in the payment space is finding value there, given the multiple you pay and our need to be able to scale whatever that business model is to justify the multiple. We look, but we haven't really hit on anything of any size. But we'll continue to look.","Robert Reilly","But there's no material.","William Demchak","There's not a whole there.","Operator","There are no further questions.","William Demchak","Okay.

Welcome to the PNC Financial Services Group Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, January 16, 2014. I would now like to turn the conference over to Bill Callihan. Please go ahead, sir.","William H. Callihan","Good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call is PNC's President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Our forward-looking statements regarding PNC's performance assume a continuation of the current economic conditions and do not take into account the impact of potential legal and regulatory or federal debt ceiling contingencies. Actual results and future events could differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in our statements and from historical performance due to a variety of factors and risks. Information about such factors, as well as GAAP reconciliation and other information on non-financial measures we discuss is included in today's conference call, earnings release and related presentation materials and in our 10-K, 10-Q and various other SEC filings and investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under the Investor Relations section. These statements speak only as of January 16, 2014, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Demchak.","William S. Demchak","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everybody. As you've seen, today, we reported record net income of $4.2 billion or $7.39 per diluted common share for the full year. That was up 41% versus last year's net income of $3 billion or $5.30 per diluted common share. Our return on average assets for the full year was 1.38%.","Now without question, 2013 was a good year for us, and our results offer an important measure of validation of the strategy and the priorities in which we've been executing. Our diversified businesses delivered fee income growth of 22% for the full year in 2013. Now to be fair, this includes a large positive swing from the mortgage business year-on-year. But even excluding mortgage, we increased fees by almost 9%.","We also grew loans and deposits throughout the year. Year-over-year commercial and consumer lending combined were up $9.8 billion or about 5%. Deposits were up $7.8 billion or 4%. And it's worth noting that results in the Southeast continue to outpace our expectations as we work aggressively to raise awareness of our brand, capture market share and build franchise value in our recently acquired markets.","Consolidated asset management revenue was up by $173 million or 15% year-over-year due to increases in the equity markets and strong sales production resulting in net positive flows. Within our Asset Management Group, net primary client acquisitions were up 22% with referral sales from other PNC lines of businesses up 44% compared to a year ago.","In retail, we took important steps to redefine the value exchange between the bank and our retail customers. And we made progress towards a reinvention of the Retail Banking experience that will enable us to more effectively and efficiently meet our customers' needs for generations to come.","Indicative of our customers' rapidly evolving preference for a customizable multi-channel experience, we had record-high migration of deposit transactions in 2013. In the fourth quarter, non-branch deposit transactions by ATM and Mobile increased to 30% of the total deposit transactions. That's almost twice the rate we saw in the fourth quarter of last year.","While it was a tough year for the mortgage industry, we made a lot of progress in building an integrated mortgage lending business that is a contributor to the PNC brand. To that end, in 2013, we introduced seamless delivery, which is just the first step in our long-term effort to reengineer the home-buying experience to get customers from application to closing more efficiently than our peers and to improve the quality of service they receive throughout their experience.","Customer loyalty continues to grow stronger as a result of these efforts. So we also reached settlements relating to repurchase obligations with the GSEs that will take some uncertainty out of the future performance of this business. Now while origination volumes overall were down for the industry in 2013, we, in fact, were flat. Further, in keeping with our strategic focus, we grew purchase volume year-over-year by 31%, more than double the industry purchase growth rate. Meanwhile, we took steps on expenses in line with the decline in refinance originations, and we'll continue to monitor and manage against these trends in 2014.","Now on the whole, 2013 was a good year for PNC, but frankly, it was a good year for the industry. What distinguished us was our ability to outpace the falloff in purchase accretion accounting with organic growth and to continue our focus on our long-term strategic priorities.","We improved our efficiency ratio from 68% last year to 61% in 2013, but it remains higher than we'd like. But there's a myriad of reasons as to why it's higher than our peers, but in the end, our expenses are higher than they should be, and we're focused on doing something about it.","In 2013, we exceeded our $700 million continuous improvement goal and reduced expenses year-over-year by 7%.","And moving forward, we're identifying opportunities to streamline core processes in order to further move the needle on expenses and to improve operating efficiency. At the same time, we'll continue to make targeted investments to bolster critical infrastructure and in support of our lines of business, particularly as we continue the transformation of our retail branch network.","Those are efforts we're going to talk about more not just in 2014, but for the foreseeable future. Now throughout 2013, we also effectively managed our credit risk appetite as market conditions evolved, and we continue to build on our strong capital position. This stronger capital position should position us well in terms of returning more capital to our shareholders this year, subject, of course, to the CCAR process.","So building on what we achieved in 2013, our priorities for this year are very similar: to continue our growth in clients, cross-sell and resultant fee streams, all the while focusing on our long-term strategic initiatives. Our challenge in '14 remains the same as well. We will need to outpace the ongoing decline in purchase accounting accretion and the impact of low rates and heightened competition through organic growth of clients and tight expense control.","Now with that, I'll turn it over to Rob, who will talk to you about the fourth quarter results.","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes, good. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill just mentioned, 2013 was a very good year for PNC. We ended the year with a strong quarter and accomplished virtually all of our financial goals in 2013.","I'll start our fourth quarter review with our balance sheet on Slide 4. Our strong loan and fee income growth along with well-managed expenses resulted in higher retained earnings in the fourth quarter, which led to strengthened capital. As you can see, total assets on our balance sheet increased by $11.7 billion or 4% on a linked-quarter basis. Drivers of this growth were higher investment securities, which increased by $3 billion or 5%, as well as loan growth of $2.8 billion or 1%.","In regard to loans, total commercial lending grew $2.7 billion or 2%, primarily in real estate and other specialty lending businesses, including public finance. And consumer lending saw a modest net growth on a linked-quarter basis as we continue to see strong increases in automobile lending and credit card, but that was largely offset by lower Residential Mortgage, home equity and education loans.","Turning to the deposit side. Total deposits increased by $4.9 billion or 2% in the fourth quarter. This was primarily driven by increases in transaction deposits, which were up $4.6 billion or 3%, reflecting seasonal increases.","Shareholders' equity increased by $1.3 billion or 3% in the fourth quarter due to growth in retained earnings and higher AOCI. This helped drive our capital ratios higher.","Our Basel I Tier 1 common ratio at the end of the fourth quarter is estimated to be 10.5%. That's up 20 basis points since the end of the third quarter. Our Basel III Tier 1 pro forma common capital ratio was estimated to be 9.4% as of December 31, without the benefit of phase-ins. This represents a 70 basis point increase from September 30.","Breaking down the components of this ratio, we had higher retained earnings and a lower deduction for quantitative limits, slightly offset by an increase in risk-weighted assets. On top of that, we had an approximate 20 basis point benefit from higher AOCI, primarily related to the annual valuation of our pension plan assets.","As you know, we're an advanced approach bank, and I want to highlight the changes in AOCI are clearly one of the factors that will fluctuate and will impact our B3 ratio going forward. I should add that at year end, our B3 ratio under both the advanced and standardized approaches are close to converging, and it's possible that the standardized approach will become our binding constraint going forward. We'll have further disclosures on our B3 ratio in our upcoming 10-K.","Importantly, as Bill mentioned, we continue to believe we are well positioned to return additional capital to shareholders this year, subject, of course, to the CCAR process. Our balance sheet also reflects our efforts to reach the goals of the proposed liquidity coverage ratio. For example, our interest-earning deposits with banks increased by $4.1 billion on a linked-quarter basis and by more than $8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter compared to the same period a year ago.","We increased total borrowings by $5.8 billion or 14% linked quarter. A substantial portion of this supported our enhanced liquidity position, as well as loan growth. And as I introduced in our third quarter earnings call, we successfully wound down the Market Street commercial paper conduit. All commercial paper from that entity was repaid in full as of December 31.","These changes affected our net interest margin in the fourth quarter, which I'll discuss in a few minutes. As you know, the rules on liquidity coverage are still on proposed form. However, we believe we have a clear line of sight on reaching the final targets once they are established.","Turning to our income statement. Our fourth quarter reflects strong overall performance. As you can see on Slide 5, net income was $1.1 billion or $1.85 per diluted common share, and our return on average assets was 1.34%. These results reflect ongoing growth in loans and fee income and continued disciplined expense management. This quarter's results also benefited from a release of reserves for Residential Mortgage repurchase obligations and a lower-than-expected provision for credit losses.","Let me highlight a few items in our income statement. Net interest income increased by $32 million or 1% compared to the third quarter as loan growth and higher investment securities offset the decline in purchase accounting accretion. Noninterest income increased by $121 million or 7% linked quarter, and I'll provide more detail on this in a moment.","As a result, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $4.1 billion, an increase of $153 million or 4% compared to the third quarter. Fourth quarter expenses were $2.5 billion, an increase of $123 million compared to the third quarter, a bit higher than expected due to items that were specific to the quarter.","As a result, our pretax pre-provision earnings were $1.5 billion, up $30 million or 2% compared to the third quarter. Provision in the fourth quarter was $113 million. This was lower than the guidance we provided due to continued overall positive credit trends and improved housing prices, which impact our loss estimates.","For the full year, our pretax pre-provision earnings were $6.2 billion, up $1.3 billion or 26% compared to 2012. These results were driven by a 17% increase in noninterest income during 2013 while reducing full year expenses by more than 7%.","Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to net interest income. As you can see on Slide 6, total net interest income increased by $32 million on a linked-quarter basis as a result of continued loan growth and higher investment security balances and yields. Those same factors drove an increase in core net interest income, which was up $40 million or 2% on a linked-quarter basis.","Purchase accounting came in essentially where we thought, and for the full year 2013, declined by almost $300 million compared to 2012. Looking ahead, we continue to expect purchase accounting to be down another $300 million for full year 2014 compared to 2013.","Net interest margin declined by 9 basis points linked quarter, and 7 basis points of this decline can be attributed to the increase in our deposits held at banks in light of anticipated LCR requirements. In terms of positioning, our balance sheet remains asset sensitive as we have maintained a duration of equity of approximately negative 2 years. Going forward, we will continue to take a measured approach to managing our balance sheet.","Bill talked about the progress we're making with our strategic priorities, and one of the places you'll see that is in our fee income. As you can see on Slide 7, our fee income grew by $114 million or 9% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily driven by a reserve release related to our Residential Mortgage repurchase obligations, partially offset by lower net hedging gains on servicing rights. The other drivers of our quarterly increase were asset management and consumer services revenue.","Turning to our fee categories. Asset management fees increased by $34 million or 10% as a result of higher equity markets, coupled with strong business performance for both PNC and BlackRock. Consumer services fees were up $11 million or 3% compared to the third quarter, primarily as a result of higher volume of customer-initiated transactions.","Corporate services saw an increased merger and acquisition advisory and capital market fees in the fourth quarter. That was offset by a lower net valuation of commercial mortgage servicing rights compared to the third quarter. And as a result, corporate services fees declined $5 million on a linked-quarter basis.","Residential Mortgage was up $72 million on a linked-quarter basis. Three primary factors drove these results. First, we recorded $124 million release of reserves for repurchase obligations. This was the result of our previously announced settlement agreements with both GSEs. Second, we saw a decline in net hedging gains on Residential Mortgage servicing rights. And third, we had a decline in loan sales revenue driven by lower origination volume.","As you know, higher interest rates affected fourth quarter originations, which were $2.5 billion, down $1.2 billion or 33%, as a result of lower overall mortgage activity. A final point on Residential Mortgage. The gain on sale margin was 396 basis points in the fourth quarter. As you know, our margins tend to be higher than the industry as we don't utilize the broker channel to originate loans. However, this quarter, our margins benefited even further by favorable mark-to-market accounting adjustments. Going forward, we expect the gain on sale margin will trend closer to 300 basis points in 2014.","Other noninterest income increased by $23 million or 6% linked quarter, primarily due to higher revenue from private equity investments and higher credit valuations related to customer-initiated hedging activities. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the sale of Visa stock, which took place in the third quarter. Overall, noninterest income was up $121 million or 7% compared to the third quarter.","Our diversified businesses resulted in noninterest income to total revenue of 44% in the fourth quarter. That's up from 43% in the third quarter and 40% in the same quarter a year ago. This reflects the impact of delivering our strategic priorities, and we expect this percentage to continue to grow over time. For the full year, total noninterest income was $6.9 billion, an increase of $993 million or 17% compared to 2012.","Turning to expenses on Slide 8. Fourth quarter levels were up due in large part to 3 factors: first, higher incentive compensation cost due to increased business activity; second, a $50 million contribution to the PNC Foundation; and third, higher settlement costs and legal accruals primarily related to former National City Residential Mortgage activities. These items, in total, represent virtually all of the linked-quarter increase.","As you'll recall, our 2013 goal was to achieve a total of $700 million in cost savings for the year through our continuous improvement program. For the full year, we reached more than $775 million. As a result, for full year 2013, expenses were lower by $781 million or more than 7% compared to 2012 expenses.","Because of the success we've had with our continuous improvement program, we plan to sustain our efforts in this regard. We have established a continuous improvement target for 2014 and have a goal to reduce costs by an additional $500 million. By design, these savings will essentially fund the significant investments that we're making in our infrastructure and in our retail bank transformation this year, which is consistent with our strategic priorities.","As you can see on Slide 9, overall credit quality continued to improve in the fourth quarter as both criticized commercial loans and total delinquencies decreased on a linked-quarter basis. Nonperforming loans were down $118 million or 4% compared to the third quarter as we saw broad-based improvement on our commercial loan portfolios.","Net charge-offs decreased $35 million or 16%, primarily due to declines in the commercial portfolio, partially offset by increases in the consumer portfolio. While we were pleased with this performance, we continue to believe the low level of net charge-offs is not sustainable over time.","Finally, our provision of $113 million declined by $24 million or 18% on a linked-quarter basis. This was driven by overall improved credit quality and better-than-expected improvement in housing prices.","In summary, PNC posted strong financial results in the fourth quarter and for full year 2013. Turning to 2014, we believe that the U.S. economy will expand at a muted pace and that short-term interest rates will remain low. With that in mind, we expect full year revenues to continue to be under some pressure and as a result, could likely be down year-over-year due to further purchase accounting declines, as well as lower Residential Mortgage revenues. Partially offsetting this, of course, will be our ability to grow loans and sustain growth in our fee-based businesses.","Recognizing this environment, disciplined expense management will continue to be a priority. As a result, we expect full year expenses to be down when compared to 2013.","Looking ahead to the first quarter of this year, we expect modest growth in loans. However, we expect net interest income to be down modestly, reflecting the continued decline in purchase accounting and the impact of fewer days in the first quarter. We expect fee income to be down due to the benefit we had this quarter from the release of reserves to the Residential Mortgage repurchase obligations along with some seasonality. We expect noninterest expense to be down mid-single digits when compared to the fourth quarter. And finally, assuming credit -- continued credit quality improvements, we expect the provision for credit losses to be between $125 million and $200 million.","And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.","William S. Demchak","Operator, if you could you give our participants instructions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.","Thomas LeTrent","This is actually Thomas on behalf of Paul. Just a quick clarification point, the $500 million of expenses that you expect to take out in 2014, that's off -- that's full year '14 over full year '13, correct?","Robert Q. Reilly","That's correct. Yes, that's correct.","Thomas LeTrent","Okay, perfect. And then you have about $130 million of repurchase reserves left, do we see that to begin to come back a little bit where [ph] sort of GSEs [ph] behind you and all that?","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes. Tom, this is Rob. Yes, we would expect to see that come down. We don't have definitive numbers on that, but that'll be part of our disclosures in our upcoming 10-K.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I was wondering, Rob, in terms of the loan growth, are you seeing any change in customer mindset on loan demand or is the growth you're seeing still kind of market share gains?","Robert Q. Reilly","I would say in terms of what we're seeing on the commercial side is very consistent with what we saw most during the year in terms of commercial real estate and some of the specialty lending businesses that we've seen. On the consumer side, the growth is coming in the form of the indirect auto, as well as the credit card, offset by the residential mortgages. So I wouldn't say there's any major change. Bill often alludes to the fact that the market share gains that we're seeing are sort of limited to certain geographies that we're in but not necessarily big movements.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And the core NII did well this quarter. What's your outlook for the core NII assuming the kind of current rate environment? What are some of the puts and takes on growing core NII?","Robert Q. Reilly","Well, we -- so we said in our first quarter guidance for core NII, we expect that to be modestly down. What were -- the challenges in the first quarter will be the continued decline in purchase accounting, as well as a couple of few less calendar days. Our ability go against that will be the loan growth.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Got it. I was thinking broader for the year x purchase accounting that's really loan growth versus still low rates?","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes, you got it.","William S. Demchak","Yes.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And then just a little bigger picture for Robert, Bill, on capital return it seems like you're in good shape to increase capital return as you mentioned. Any kind of broad-level comments even beyond this year about what an appropriate payout ratio should be for PNC when you look at the math of your ROE and your asset growth profile over the next couple of years. Not trying to back into this year's, not...","William S. Demchak","I'm not -- I'll purposely be vague so you can't. Now going forward, I think for us and the rest of the industry, capital returns are going to become a bigger part of the story. What's going to be interesting is that at some point, as we all hit our operating targets on capital, the total amount of capital return is going to approach 100% or even go over. And then you get into this debate of whether -- how you can split that between dividends and share repurchase. But for PNC, absent the capital we need for organic growth, which has been pretty robust, our intention is to return it back to shareholders.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. One quick follow-up on the NII. You mentioned LCR, are you now fully prepared for your understanding of what LCR is?","William S. Demchak","We -- well, we still have some moving parts on their proposal in terms of what's in and what's out. We are close but not there yet and working towards it. You saw this quarter the big increases in balances at the Fed, and that'll continue to increase. We still have some outstanding questions on Level 1 securities we pledge against municipal deposits and a whole bunch of other random things that we need to work through. But long story short on LCR, we can get there. It's kind of a mechanical exercise. It'll cost us a little bit of money at the margin.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Robert Placet - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Rob Placet from Matt's team. First question on expenses. Your guidance is for 1Q expenses to be down mid-single digits. Does that include the $50 million charitable contribution and the legal accruals taken this quarter?","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes. Rob, this is Rob. Yes, it does. And just a clarification to the earlier question around the continuous improvement, that $500 million are additional ideas. But that's largely, as I mentioned in my opening comments, much of that will be used to fund the investments in technology and the retail transformation. So I just wanted to clarify that earlier point.","Robert Placet - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, right. So on the cost savings, should we not expect that $500 million to reduce your run rate expense levels from here? It'll be used for investments [ph].","William S. Demchak","The only -- so fourth quarter to first quarter comparison is a big comparison because fourth quarter was elevated. So that's why we said mid-single digits, and then the guidance for the full year is just that we will be down without getting specific about it. Now we have a lot of programs in place, and we're going to try to be aggressive about it, but we haven't given you specific numbers on actual expenses for next year.","Robert Q. Reilly","Or full year.","William S. Demchak","Yes. But year-on-year comparison target is to be down.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Murray with ISI.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Would you guys be able to quantify the private equity gains and the hedging gains that you noted on the fee income side this quarter?","Robert Q. Reilly","Sure. That's in our other income, and that is why it's elevated. I don't think we disclosed a specific number around the private equity transactions. They were up year-over-year, which was part of the elevated incentive compensation that we talked about in the fourth quarter. But generally speaking, in that other income, we say that we can usually count on roughly $300 million or so in that category on a quarterly basis. This particular quarter was a little bit higher because of that transaction, as well as some CBA [ph].","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the $500 million of savings that you've targeted, is there a pension expense improvement in there? And would you be able to quantify that?","Robert Q. Reilly","No, no. We don't have any pension-related items in the expense savings.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So could that be something on top of that for '14?","William S. Demchak","It's already embedded in the generic guidance that we think we can be down year-on-year in total expenses. We talk about continuous improvement, and that the important thing is saying that we'll have expenses down year-on-year. So continuous improvement is an internal exercise that allows us to recycle expenses in effect, to fund our investments. So it's an internal goal. It's important because we try to sell fun [ph] things but practically focus on the year-on-year down, and we haven't been specific on that percentage.","Robert Q. Reilly","That's right.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And obviously, you showed very strong commercial growth, loan growth this quarter. Is there any uptick on the consumer demand yet? I know there's a small uptick in loans for this quarter, but are you seeing any change in mindset there?","William S. Demchak","Not particularly. We have gives and takes where you see auto, a little bit of card, offset by residential home equity, and student lending, which will continue to roll off. So basically flat this quarter and fairly muted growth we'd expect going out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Bryan Batory - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is Bryan Batory calling from Ken's team. My first question is just on the size of the balance sheet going forward. So the loans, securities and cash were all up on a quarter-over-quarter basis, and we get your -- the loan guide for modest growth in the first quarter, but how would you expect these securities balances and liquidity to trend going forward?","William S. Demchak","I don't know that I have specific answer to that. Some of the security balances that you saw on a spot basis kind of all occurred in late in the year, and frankly, where Treasury securities that were asset swapped largely against LCR requirements. So it's inflated, but it's not -- that wasn't what was driving our net interest income. So as we go forward, that mix between what we hold in securities to deal with LCR is going to kind of drive that. Loan growth basis, we're kind of saying mid-single digits. Of course, what changes that is if the economy really comes back, and we see utilization change, when you could then see that growth be quite substantial beyond that.","Bryan Batory - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then a final one on loan yields. So we saw them start to flatten out this quarter, and just wondering if you think we should start to kind of see loan yields bottom here in the -- when we move through '14.","William S. Demchak","We're not -- I don't know that we're expecting that. If you follow cycles and loan yields continue to -- loan spreads, I shouldn't say outright yields but loan spreads continue to contract until something bad happens. So we've seen on the C&I side, I think we said it's seen a pretty steady grind of 4 or 5 basis points a quarter, and our expectation is will continue to see that.","Robert Q. Reilly","Consistent with what we saw in the fourth quarter.","William S. Demchak","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Erika Najarian calling in for Erika Najarian. Just to take a step back, Bill, what do you think -- we're hearing you loud and clear. You made such great progress in efficiency this past year, but you think there's more wood to chop. As you think about the franchise over the next 2 or 3 years, without the help of rates, what do you think is the natural efficiency ratio of your business as it stands today? And can we look forward to an efficiency ratio that will go sub-60% at some point this year?","William S. Demchak","Look, I don't know where it gets to in '14, but we don't target an end efficiency ratio because there's too many variables. I mean, you tell me an interest rate scenario, and I'll tell you what the answer will be on a efficiency ratio. What we do know is when we look at the way we're spending money in our core operations, we're inefficient. And more importantly, as we grow our company, what we were finding was that we weren't getting economies of scale out of the back office. In fact, our back-office costs were growing faster than our front-line operations. So our big focus over the next 2, 3, 4 years is really to streamline operations in technology that -- in a way that not just takes dollars out, but importantly gives us an ability to scale with revenues and create positive operating leverage. So we can be better than where we are on a ratio basis, but I don't tend to think about it that way. I tend to just look at what we're spending and say I can do better through time by rationalizing some of the stuff that we've put together through the integrations.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And my follow-up question is, thank you for the color that you gave in terms a further -- potentially building our liquidity position, but once that's behind us, if we just think about the core margin for this year, excluding purchase accounting and think about where the forward curve is indicating, is it too optimistic to think that the core margin x purchase accounting will bottom in 2014?","William S. Demchak","Will bottom in 2014. No, I don't think that's...","Robert Q. Reilly","I wouldn't say that's too optimistic.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. Just given that answer, I guess I'm kind of intrigued about your guidance in the discussion for net interest income because since you do have growth in loans and presumably earning assets, maybe could you just kind of flesh out your kind of expectations for full year net interest income? We know you've got kind of $300 million of purchase accounting reductions that you've got to face. But...","William S. Demchak","That's our fight, right? So you have the $300 million that comes off the top. We know we're going to grow loans. Loans are contracting in spread by our 4 basis points a quarter. We've largely run out the deposit repricing. And our security balances, all else equal, if we keep them neutral to duration of equity, we're rolling off 3.25 yields and putting on a 2.75. Those are all the moving pieces, right? It can change. If rates went up, and we invested more in securities, if loan growth was higher, utilization went up. But when we look at sort of the assumption that rates are going to do what the forward curve says, and we maintain a negative duration of equity, my comments are it's going to be the same fight in '14 we had in '13 to grow core.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right, but at the same time...","William S. Demchak","We're going to try to do it.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But I guess I was referring to the comment about the stabilization of the core margin during the year that would sort of lend credence to that number.","William S. Demchak","No. Well, but remember the question was an easy question to answer because she said is it going to bottom. So it could bottom on December 31 of '14. I hope it bottoms before that, but those questions or those comments are kind of unrelated.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got you, and as far...","Robert Q. Reilly","This is Rob. I [indiscernible] that I think Bill said it will. I think what we expect to see in '14 is very much a continuation of what we saw in '13 in regard to NII.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And in terms of -- on the expense front, I mean, just could you just talk a little bit your thought process about the pace of investment. In other words, is it something that to the extent you have more available, you'll do more but are committed to keeping kind of headline expenses down? Or is there kind of a fixed amount that you feel like you have to do?","William S. Demchak","Probably a little bit of both. I mean, there is fixed infrastructure expense that we have in our budget that we need to do to be efficient in this environment. We're self-funding that through continuous improvement. At the margin, are there things that we could accelerate? Yes, probably. But we're keeping our eye on that, and it's important to us in this environment to be disciplined on expenses.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And just the very last thing. When you talked about kind of a long-term framework for capital return of everything that isn't needed for internal growth, what do you think is the time frame to get there? Is it, I mean, is it going to be '14, '15, '16 like, what -- when do you think you reach that kind of normal level?","William S. Demchak","I don't -- we are today running over operating targets that we've put out there before. For an environment where -- for the CCAR process, the body language and guidance is still on a build capital mode coming from the regulators. At some point, my comment was just kind of at some point, we and everybody else are going to get to a point where we're well above whatever threshold you need to hold, and you're going to see total return to shareholders increase. I don't know when that is. It's not this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Bill, speaking of capital, what's the level whatever it's determined that PNC will be required to keep let's say in the Basel III Tier 1 common ratio. I guess, tentatively it's 7% today. There might be a small SIFI buffer for you and your peers, but what level above that are you going to play? Once we get to this normalization period, what level do you think you're comfortable with carrying your Tier 1 common ratio at?","William S. Demchak","It's a great question, and the answer is actually what level do we want to end up at in the stress test. So our starting point kind of is a function of the target of the ending point. And of course, we want to maintain and be above the 4.5% in the severe adverse. Now the reason I say that is, depending on the economy that we're in or risk factors, that could dictate that we would run at an 8.25% in one environment and 8.75% in another environment. So I don't know -- we've talked about being 8% to 8.5% as a guideline. That kind of is reflective of where we sit today and what we expect we see in stresses. That could change through time depending on the environment. One of the things -- if you look at our ratio, the outperformance in B3 Tier 1 common this quarter, some of that came from AOCI and the effect of revaluing pension, right? If you think of in a stress, that will disappear instantaneously the same way it appeared.","Robert Q. Reilly","And that's 20 basis points in the fourth quarter.","William S. Demchak","Yes. So in effect, things that -- AOCI swinging around can cause you to carry a higher ratio than you otherwise might. But we don't -- we're not going to simply say we get to 8.5%, and that's where we need to stay. We need to look at the environment, and we need to make sure that in severe adverse case that we're above our thresholds.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And shifting back to your comments about the investing that you're doing, what are some of the targeted areas where you're going to spend that money this year in the -- on the investment side for the firm?","William S. Demchak","Yes. So business-focused investment, a lot of it's going into retail where we continue to roll out of image-enabled ATMs and reconfiguration of branches as we make that change. On the technology side, core infrastructure side, we've got a lot going on, both application, replacement, infrastructure, data center upgrades, cybersecurity, all the stuff that I think we need to be a top player inside of this environment and against our -- the expectations we want to have with our retail clients on a seamless delivery through digital and physical space.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Should we anticipate -- I may have missed this, you might have already addressed it, that there will be more branch closings in 2014?","William S. Demchak","It's -- you're going to see -- it'll be a push. We're going to open some and consolidate some. But what you'll see through time is the reconfiguration of branches with universal employees, with square footage per branch on average going down with the continued rollout of image-enabled ATMs into old branch structures. So we're kind of, the raw number of touch points feels about right. But you're going to still see us reconfigure those touch points.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Is -- do you get a sense, without holding you to a specific number, but when you guys look at the retail delivery channel, you gave us a number today, 30% is being the deposits are coming from outside that traditional teller channel. Do you have an idea where that can go to and then finally kind of like top out?","William S. Demchak","I don't know that I do. I think it can go materially higher from where it is. Our goal here, and it's important, we will serve the clients in whatever form they want. So whether that's they want to use tellers or universal employees or use digital, we'll do that. Through time, the trend continues to be increasingly towards digital. But we don't know the answer to that, right? That's part of what's playing out in the industry, and we're trying to figure that out as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It's Betsy Graseck. So a couple of questions. One was on reinvestments. And it does look like you've reinvested in the mortgage market. You mentioned that the purchase mortgage originations you've had are about twice the industry in 2013. So wanted to understand what else you have to do there in the mortgage space to leverage the mortgage banking platform you have and how you are going to be navigating this year with, again, a big decline in refi. Maybe you could just talk to that.","William S. Demchak","Well, the -- so mortgage investment, we rolled out seamless delivery. We have, I mean, the investment goes back several years where we consolidated underwriting platforms and upgraded technology and worked through all the changing regulations. All that's ongoing. But the big change though is the work we've been doing in integrating mortgage into the company, right? And that's why -- that's one of the primary reasons why you see our purchase volume outpacing perhaps some of our peers. Instead of being a business where they were kind of out on their own originating transactions, now they're integrated into the branch network and part of our company. So we're working our retail channels a lot more aggressively than we used to. New things that will rollout in mortgage through time, we're working on a product that's kind of the equivalent of our Virtual Wallet or Wealth Insight or CFO Insight that will play in the mortgage space that we're pretty excited about and ought to help again with purchase volume. Notwithstanding all that, '14 is going to be tough. Volumes are going to be down. We've taken out costs. You saw in the third and fourth quarter, and we'll continue to watch that and deal with that depending on what volumes are.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And when you think about capacity utilization in the mortgage banking platform that you have, what's your sense of where it's running right now?","William S. Demchak","It's pretty close to capacity simply because one of the things we did when volumes were -- one of the reasons we saw volume actually stay flat year-on-year is we were -- we had to build capacity to keep up with the refi requests we had. And we had, in fact, a third party out there who was helping us with some of that. So for our downsizing relative to new origination volumes, we were actually just -- we were able to cut this third party out and then take expenses out. So we're pretty much right-sized on the origination side today. We have opportunities on the servicing side as we work our way through the new mortgage regulations and become efficient on that. And then we'll see where we go depending on volumes.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, I guess because one of the questions is couldn't you take your platform and expand over a broader geographic mix than you have right now?","William S. Demchak","You could, but we're national now, right? So we're integrated into the bank and we deal with our retail footprint, but we're pretty much across the country as we sit today.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right, right. Okay. I was just thinking, you might be able to do more in non-footprint locations than you have been doing. But I guess your answer is no.","William S. Demchak","I'm sure there is opportunity. I mean, our presumption is, if we can get good loan originators in this market, we would do so.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then the second kind of theme is on auto, and I just wanted to dig in a little bit on what your plans are for focusing on the auto space, given that there's a little bit of a shift going on there, too.","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes. Sure, Betsy. This is Rob. I'll answer that. We have, as you know, seen significant growth in our auto portfolio. There's been a lot of talk in the industry in terms of where we are in terms of sort of the cycle in that regard. We are starting to see longer tenures and some pricing contraction, which we're cautious about. That being said, we still see growth in 2014 because auto numbers are still -- manufacturing are still very strong. And we've expanded a lot of our dealer networks across geographies, particularly in the Southeast, and we're seeing growth there. So we still see growth, maybe just not at the historical run rate.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then do you just -- do you feel like there's a better opportunity for you in either prime, near prime, subprime. Some guys are talking about how capital requirements push them one direction or the other.","William S. Demchak","No. We're not going to change our risk bucket as it relates to auto. So I think what we have the opportunity to do and we've been pursuing is, as we've expanded into the Southeast, we basically bring on board new dealerships with our program. And that's a large part of the growth that you're seeing on our balance sheet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","Bill, a question for you, and I apologize if you've given this answer. I'm sure you probably have at recent conferences, but I missed it. Could you just sort of give the -- what you see as the high level impact of the Volcker Rule for PNC and if there's any estimate that you have of how much it's going to cost you or not cost you?","William S. Demchak","Yes. I mean, I will give you a sort of preliminary views. The direct impact that we have, and we've talked about this is that through time, we'll have to run down parts of our alternative investment books or our private equity book. We're prepared to do that. A lot of it's going to be monitoring costs. So we're going to have to have lots of people proving that we don't anything that we never did. And we'll make sure as we go through certain of our hedging activities on the balance sheet that they're compliant. So I don't know in the end that it's going to have a huge impact on us beyond the cost of compliance and the work set to make sure that we're there. One of the things I'll just bring up that you see in the press is the impact on CLOs, where depending on the structure of CLOs, they were ineligible securities. Of course, you see all the noise around the [indiscernible]. We own loan-based, so C&I loan-based CLOs, which are all largely at par thereabouts, and there is some possibility that some of those might need to be exited. But frankly, the industry is kind of working on that, and I think they can be restructured. So no real impact from that either. So I think -- a long-winded answer, but it's going to be a lot of work without a lot of impact I think.","Robert Q. Reilly","Nancy, this is Rob. I'll just add to that just to round that out. We have very de minimis holdings in CDOs. So that's not an issue for us.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And along the same line, Bill, I mean, do you -- could you just give us your view of how you see the housing market shaping up in terms of legislation, shape, et cetera, and if you see any sort of long-term impacts for PNC?","William S. Demchak","I don't have a crystal ball into that. I read the same press and from the same players that you do. I think at the end of the day, housing finance is going to be the single-most important financial transaction that our retail clients are going to deal with. We need to be good at it. We're going to evolve with the industry as it evolves. Fannie and Freddie are obviously going to play a role, but it is a product that we need to be very good at. I don't have insight into the political movement as to whether or how they'll end up winding those things down.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio from KBW.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","It's Chris Mutascio from KBW. Just 2 quick questions. Rob, on the standard approach, did you give that number on Basel III? I know there's the 9.4 on the advanced approach. I know there's a gap. Did you give the standardized approach to ratio?","Robert Q. Reilly","No, no. I didn't. What I did mention, though, is in terms of our calculations, we do use the advanced approach. That's the 9.4% number. What I've mentioned was that the standardized, which we do calculate, is converging with that and going forward may be our binding constraint.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Right. So, if it's going to be your binding constraint is it something that you might disclose at a -- in a future date so we can see the difference between the 2 right now?","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes, sure. On a future date, absolutely.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","The other thing I wanted to ask, if I back out the Visa gains in third quarter, the other income line item that was very strong this quarter would have been about $380 million versus $270 million, so that about $110 million delta. I know you kind of glossed over the private equity, maybe some hedging. Are there -- can you provide any of the sequential quarter deltas, 2 or 3 line items? And if you can't provide them, can you just talk to the sustainability of roughly the $380 million number that you posted this quarter?","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes. No, good question. It's similar to the earlier one. Now I'm going to refrain from the specific categories, but we did see higher-than-usual equity management gains, if you will. And generally speaking, in terms of that other noninterest income per quarter, a $300 million number seems to be where we average over time.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And there's -- but you won't provide what that was this quarter?","Robert Q. Reilly","Well, the total was $383 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. First maybe, Rob, just in terms of credit quality and the provision guidance. You guys have been pretty consistent in terms of the provision outlook over the last several quarters. It's come down slowly over that period of time. But you look at the credit measures where we are today, 39 basis points of loss, things have gotten markedly better over the last 12 to 18 months, if you will. But as I think about the growth in the portfolio, are we now at a point where we're likely to kind of converge between charge-offs, reserves as we think about growth in '14?","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes. It's a great question, Todd, and one that we spend a lot of time on, as you know. You're right. We've -- throughout -- particularly throughout 2013, we continue to be surprised on the upside in terms of the improvement in credit quality. And as a result, in terms of our guidance, we've continued to lower the range around provision. As I said in my opening remarks, the -- we don't believe that these low levels, particularly a 39 basis point charge-off ratio, are sustainable over time. So we would expect, and I don't know what quarter that would be, but we would expect those numbers to go back more to historical norms. And that's why our guidance for 2014 is above the $113 million number that we had here in the fourth quarter.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just secondly, just in terms of on the legal accrual in the quarter, granted, it was effectively for settlements, if you will, and we've obviously seen a lot of that within the industry this quarter. I'm just wondering as we think about the volatility within your legacy mortgage segment, Nat City and so forth, are we at the -- have we hit that inflection point at this stage? Is the bulk of kind of the primary litigation now behind the company? Or could we expect to see a little bit more volatility from time to time as we go through the next 12 to 18 months, if you have any sense for that?","William S. Demchak","Without commenting on specific litigation, we disclosed all that in the Qs, and you could look through it. I think the biggest piece of volatility we got out of the mortgage business was the settlements with the GSE, which weren't really litigation per se. And we'll see. We continue to operate in a fairly strange environment as it relates to people coming after banks, but we disclosed everything, and I guess we'll leave it there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","It's Andrew Marquardt with Evercore. Couple of [indiscernible] questions. In terms of fees or core fees, however you look at it. Sorry if I missed it. Did you give any color comment in terms of how you think about the full year '14 shaping up?","Robert Q. Reilly","Andrew, this is Rob. No, we didn't do it for the full year. Again the full year guidance was in broad categories in terms of revenues and expense, total expenses. What I did say was for the first quarter guidance, we expect fees to be down modestly because the -- largely, the Residential Mortgage repurchase release was a contra revenue or a fee item, if you will, in the fourth quarter.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Right. Got it. And in terms of spread revenue, understood that kind of core NIM is still grinding lower. But then I thought I heard maybe a comment that we should think about spread revenue for this year being similar to last year. And on a core basis, that was down 2%, 2.5%. Is that how we should be thinking about it x PCI or did I not understand that correctly?","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes. No, I'm sorry. What I meant by saying what we'll see in '14 is similar to what we saw in '13 was more around the struggle, just in terms of spread compression, low rates against loan growth. So just that struggle in itself, not the outcome of that struggle for '14.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. But maybe loan growth could be better with maybe less margin pressure but still there on a core basis. Is that, so that loan growth directly [ph] could offset the ongoing pressures? Is that how we should think about it conceptually?","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes. Theoretically, absolutely.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly on expenses being down on a year-over-year basis, just to be clear that the base of that is that you're -- that we should think of is $9.8 billion kind of all-in number. Is that correct for this year, for '13?","Robert Q. Reilly","$9.8 billion for -- $9.801 billion to be exact for the full year 2013.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then should we anticipate that you'll be able to generate positive operating leverage in '14 with that kind of expense management though still challenged kind of top line? Is it possible to get positive operating leverage with that kind of backdrop scenario?","Robert Q. Reilly","Well, we didn't really approach it like that. What we said in terms of our guidance for '14, was that we do expect revenues to be under continued pressure, principally, from the purchase accounting in the lower Residential Mortgage activity. And in light of that, that we have expense management as a priority and we do have plans for the expenses to be down year-over-year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous Research.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","The -- most of my questions have been asked, but Visa, it's a big line item for you versus others. You kind of talked about the $300 million other fees, that's a lot of moving parts. But $300 million with quarterly volatility is a good guess. With Visa, any potential monetization of Visa be included in that $300 million or should we think about Visa as kind of a discrete item? If it's monetized, that would be above and beyond that $300 million run rate?","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes, I think the majority of that would be above the $300 million.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","Got it. And then on capital, certainly we'll wait for the standardized disclosure, but hopefully I'm thinking about it right. The standardized would end the opportunity to continue to have RWAs come down while assets are going up or changing, optimizing RWA mix, whatever you want to call it. But your numerator deduction has shrank a lot over the past year, too. It's still $1 billion. AOCI will do what it does on rates. But are there still opportunities to optimize the numerator independent of this standardized floor kicking in or is the numerator about where it's going to be now, and we should expect it to grow with earnings?","Robert Q. Reilly","Well, I think -- this is Rob. I think I can answer that. I think, clearly, earnings will help grow it. I think, within the disallowance of the cin [ph] bucket, probably the room where we could get more room is as we grow our Tier 1 common capital, that 15% general bucket, as you will, gets larger, creating more room in terms of what would otherwise be disallowed.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","Got it. So we should kind of build in a little bit of a multiplier where, every dollar of earnings less dividend, less buyback kind of creates $1.15 of capital?","Robert Q. Reilly","Formulaically, that's right.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Stephen Scinicariello with UBS.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's Steve Scinicariello, UBS. Just a quick one for you. Just curious -- just given the strength in the asset management side, and I know that's an area where you guys are looking to focus and grow. Just kind of curious what some of the key drivers are there. And as you look forward, what are some of the opportunities to kind of keep that going into '14 and beyond?","Robert Q. Reilly","Sure. This is Rob. Yes, we've been very pleased in terms of the growth in the Asset Management business, particularly following, as you know, several years of investments in terms of building out that distribution. We're still optimistic. The -- as Bill mentioned earlier, in terms of what we're trying to do with the mortgage company is largely what we've been doing with the Asset Management Group. And that's why referrals being up 44% is driving those kinds of numbers and confirming and validating our strategy in terms of that cross-sell, if you will. So we do see opportunities within the existing consumer base. And then obviously, with the addition of the Southeast territories and the offices that we put in place there, we'll continue to be optimistic.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And so you still feel you'd be able to kind of grow that year-over-year at kind of a high-single-digit or even better kind of number in terms of revenues?","William S. Demchak","Yes.","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes. That's right.","William H. Callihan","Bill, do you have some closing comments?","William S. Demchak","No. It's -- just quickly I guess. '13 was a great year for us and for the industry. We're looking forward to '14. I think we've been pretty clear on what our challenges and opportunities are. We appreciate everybody joining us this morning.","William H. Callihan","Thank you.

As you have seen this morning, we reported net income of $1.1 billion or $1.85 per diluted common share for the quarter with the return on average assets of 1.31%. For the first half of the year we are largely trending in line with our planning assumptions you have seen that we have grown loans by more than 5 billion and we are growing our fee businesses as planned. Credit quality continues to improve and we are managing expenses well in spite of a modest increase this quarter due in large part to seasonality. At the same time interest rates remain low and we are seeing the market moving beyond what our risk return appetite will tolerate in some asset categories and it\u2019s been particularly true in certain parts of consumer and small business lending and on the pricing side in the corporate bank. Still in the Southeast loan and client growth basically across all lines of business continue to exceed our expectations.","In retail we are on target to have completed more than 150 universal branch conversions by the end of this year and more than 300 by the end of the first quarter next year. For mortgage we focused on growing our percentage of new purchase originations as refinance activity declines for the industry and we are pleased that the new purchases were 50% of our originations in the second quarter. Having said that lower volumes and continued elevated cost structures related to foreclosure activity will continue to make this a difficult business in the near-term.","Finally we continue to see strong growth in fees out of our asset management group with total non-interest income in this business up 11% year-to-date versus the first half of 2013. So on the whole we are trending as we expected through the first half. Still, we are in the same boat as all of our competitors recognizing the continuing credit quality improvement and lower provision have basically enabled us to mitigate the impact of low rates, but these conditions aren't going to last forever.","The great unknown as we look towards the end of the this year and into 2015 is when credit quality will begin to normalize and whether rates will rise in time to offset the higher credit costs that will naturally be the result when this occurs. Nobody knows how this rates will play out, but we are mindful of it as we focused on delivering a differentiated customer experience in creating long-term shareholder value.","To that end, we continue to strengthen our Basel III capital position in the quarter and in keeping with our previously stated intention to return more capital to shareholders we increased our quarterly common stock dividend by 9% to $0.48 per share for the second quarter of 2014. We also repurchased 2.6 common shares.","And with that I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our second quarter results. Thanks.","Rob Reilly","Thanks Bill and good morning everyone. Overall we had a solid second quarter that continued many of the trends we saw in the first quarter. Importantly our second quarter results were in line with the guidance we provided during our last earnings call and demonstrate a consistency of performance that supports our growth strategies.","The sustained low interest rate environment continues to affect our net interest income. However we saw a strong fee income growth this quarter that more than offset the net interest income declines, resulting in revenue growth on a linked quarter basis.","Expenses remained well controlled and credit quality was favorable. Our capital ratios increased even after returning $479 million in share buybacks and dividends to our shareholders in the second quarter compared to $234 million in the same period a year ago.","Now let me start with our balance sheet on slide four. As you can see total assets on our balance sheet increased by $3.6 billion or 1% on a linked-quarter basis and included net loan growth of $2.7 billion or 1.4%.","Total commercial lending during the second quarter grew $3.3 billion or 3% with growth in nearly all areas. And consumer lending was down by $568 million or 1% linked quarter as declines in home equity, residential mortgage lending and education loans offset increases primarily in credit card and automobile lending.","Compared to the same quarter a year ago, overall loan growth was $11.2 billion or 6%. Investment securities decreased by $2 billion or 3.5% in the second quarter as net payments and maturities exceeded our reinvestment activity, reflecting the current low interest rate environment. And lastly, our balances with the Federal Reserve increased to $16.5 billion in anticipation of proposed rules on liquidity coverage standards.","On the liability side, total deposits increased by $172 million when compared to March 31st driven mostly by increases on the consumer side. We saw growth in demand, money market and savings deposits partially offset by lower retail CDs.","Shareholders\u2019 equity increased by $884 million in the second quarter, primarily due to growth in retained earnings. This helped to drive our capital ratios higher. Our pro forma Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in and using the standardized approach was estimated to be 10% as of June 30, a 30 basis-point increase from the end of the first quarter.","As you know, from a regulatory capital perspective, we\u2019re subject to the transitional Basel III rules; our transitional B3 common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated to be 11% as of June 30th, an increase of 20 basis points from March 31st.","As I mentioned, our balance sheet reflects our efforts to comply with the proposed liquidity coverage ratio and support continued loan growth. For example, our interest-earnings deposits with banks, which are primarily with the Federal Reserve, increased by $2 billion from March 31, and by more than $13 billion compared to the same time a year ago.","We increased total borrowings by $2.3 billion or 5% linked-quarter, a substantial portion of this supported our enhanced liquidity position as well as loan growth. As you know, the LCR rules are still in proposed form, however we believe we are well positioned in relation to the proposed targets.","Finally, our tangible book value reached $58.22 per common share as of June 30, a 3.4% increase linked-quarter and a 15% increase compared to the same time a year ago, reflecting our commitment to delivering shareholder value.","Under our existing common stock repurchase authorization we repurchased approximately 2.6 million common shares for approximately $225 million during the second quarter against our capital plan of $1.5 billion. We remain committed to shareholder capital return and expect to continue our buyback program with the flexibility to increase repurchases over our second quarter levels through the first quarter of 2015.","Turning to our income statement on slide five, net income was $1.1 billion or $1.85 per diluted common share and our return on average assets was 1.31%. Our second quarter performance for net interest income and expenses were as expected, while exceeding expectations on fee income and provision. As a result, total revenue increased by $33 million or 1% linked-quarter.","Let me highlight a few items in our income statement. Net interest income declined by $66 million or 3% compared to the first quarter. Of that $31 million was due to the impact of an accounting change to reclassify certain commercial facility fees from net interest income to corporate service fees. Importantly, this change is revenue neutral.","The remaining NII decline of $35 million was primarily attributable to lower purchase accounting accretion and lower loan yields and security balances. Non-interest income increased by $99 million or 6% linked-quarter, primarily due to fee income growth in corporate which includes the reclassification as well as increases in consumer fees and residential mortgage revenue. Non-interest expense increased by $64 million or 3% in the second quarter following seasonally lower cost in the first quarter. Overall, expenses continue to be well managed.","Finally provision in the second quarter declined to $72 million due to continued overall positive credit trends. Now let\u2019s discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail.","Turning to net interest income on slide six, total net interest income decreased by $66 million or 3% for the reasons I just highlighted. As you can see, purchase accounting accretion declined on a linked-quarter basis consistent with our expectations. Regarding our core NII excluding the $31 million impact of the accounting change, the net impact was a decline of $19 million which is primarily related to lower security balances, spread compression and liquidity related actions.","Net interest margin declined 14 basis points linked-quarter; of that amount approximately 5 basis points was due to the commercial fee reclassification. Of the remaining 9 basis-point decline in NIM, 3 basis points was attributable to purchase accounting accretion and additional 3 basis points was due to liquidity related actions and the remaining 3 basis points was primarily due to spread compression.","In terms of our interest rate sensitivity, our balance sheet remains asset sensitive as we have maintained a duration of equity of approximately negative 2.5 years. Although we recognize this may constrain our NII growth, we will continue to remain disciplined with the focus on achieving appropriate long-term risk adjusted returns.","Turning to non-interest income, we saw a strong fee income growth this quarter, reflecting progress we continue to make against our strategic priorities. Total non-interest income increased by $99 million or 6% linked-quarter. Now in fairness, $31 million was related to the commercial fee reclassification. However the remaining growth reflected momentum across our diversified businesses.","As Bill mentioned our asset management group had another good quarter with growth driven by increases in the equity markets and sales production. As you know the asset management fee category reflects the combination of fees generated by our asset management business along with the earnings attributable to our interest in BlackRock.","Compared to the same quarter last year, overall asset management fees were up $22 million, or 6% due to increases in equity markets and sales production.","Consumer services fees and deposit service charges were higher in both the linked-quarter and year-over-year comparisons. Compared to the first quarter these fees increased by $42 million or 10% as we saw strong growth in credit and debit card, merchant services and brokerage fees due to broadly higher customer activity.","Compared to the second quarter of last year, fees were up $18 million or 4% primarily due to growth in customer activity.","Corporate services fees were up $42 million or 14% linked-quarter, as I mentioned $31 million of that was attributable to the reclassification. However excluding that, fees increased $11 million or 4% linked-quarter primarily due to higher treasury management fees. Compared to the second quarter of last year and again setting aside the rate class corporate services fees were down by $14 million or 4% primarily driven by lower net CMSR valuations.","Residential mortgage banking, non-interest income increased $21 million or 13% primarily driven by higher loan sales revenue. A couple of items to point out here in regard to our mortgage revenue. First, we recorded a production income increase of approximately $11 million reflecting higher quarter over quarter originations. Second we had elevated loan sales and fair value mark increases on portfolio loans totaling $61 million in the second quarter compared to $24 million in the first quarter or a $37 million linked-quarter increase. And third partially offsetting these items was a net $21 million reduction of repurchase reserve assets compared to the linked quarter.","Origination volume increased to $2.6 billion in the second quarter up from $1.9 billion in the first quarter but down from $4.7 billion in the same quarter a year ago. Importantly, purchase originations production of $1.3 billion in the second quarter essentially equaled to same quarter a year ago reflecting our strategic focus in this area and purchase originations represented 50% of our total originations.","The gain on sale margin was 538 basis points in the second quarter. Our margins benefited from the gains associated with the loan sales and fair value marks that I just mentioned. We continue to expect our margin to trend closer to the 300 basis points through the remainder of 2014.","Other non-interest income increased $19 million or 8% primarily due to higher revenue related to asset sales and higher credit valuations from customer related derivative activities. Non-interest income was also impacted by lower pre-tax gain of $54 million on the sale of $1 million Visa Class B common shares that compared with the $62 million gain on Visa shares that took place in the first quarter.","Non-interest income to total revenue was 44% in the second quarter up 2 percentage points from first quarter levels and it held steady from the same quarter a year ago when we experienced higher gains on asset sales and valuations. This reflects the progress we\u2019re making against our strategic initiatives to increase overall fee income on both an absolute and relative basis.","Turning to expenses on slide eight; second quarter levels increased by $64 million to 3% consistent with our guidance due to seasonal factors such as higher compensation and marketing costs during the period. On a year-over-year basis expenses are down $77 million or 3% reflecting strong benefits from our continuous improvement program and overall expense management.","As we have previously stated, our CIP program has a goal to achieve $500 million in annualized cost savings in 2014. We're half way through the year and we've already completed actions relating to capturing more than two-thirds of our goal. And as a result, we're confident we will achieve our full year CIP target. With these savings to-date, along with further planned activities, we intend to fund the significant investments we're making in our infrastructure and in our retail transformation.","As you can see on slide nine, overall credit quality continued to improve in the second quarter. Nonperforming loans were down $146 million or 5% compared to the first quarter as we saw broad improvements across our commercial and consumer portfolios. Total past due loans decreased by $128 million or 6% linked-quarter. Net charge-offs declined by $41 million or 22% linked-quarter and were 29 basis points of average loans on an annualized basis down 9 basis points linked-quarter.","Our provision of $72 million declined by $22 million or 23% on a linked-quarter basis. Finally, the allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans is 1.72% as of June 30th. While we were pleased with this performance and as we've acknowledged for some time, we continue to believe credit trends may not remain at these levels.","In summary, PNC posted a successful second quarter largely consistent with our expectations. Going forward assuming a continuation of a current economic environment, we continue to expect that full year revenue will be under pressure and as a result could likely be down year-over-year due to the further purchase accounting accretion declines and lower residential mortgage revenues.","Regarding purchase accounting, we continue to expect it will be down approximately $300 million for full year 2014 compared to 2013 and for 2015 we expect purchase accounting accretion to be down approximately $225 million for the full year compared to 2014. In this environment we will remain focused on disciplined expense management and we continue to expect full year expenses to be down when compared to 2013.","Looking ahead to the third quarter we expect modest growth in loans primarily in our commercial portfolio, we expect net interest income to be down modestly due to the continued decline in purchase accounting accretion and further spread compression. We expect fee income to remain stable as we expect growth in our other fee based businesses to offset the benefit of the elevated second quarter gains in residential mortgage.","We expect non-interest expense to be up by low single-digits as we will have some increase in the third quarter expenses related to employee benefit seasonality and also some cost related to be automating of our regulatory submissions.","Finally assuming a continuation of the current credit trends we expect the provision for credit losses to be between $75 million and $125 million.","And with that Bill and I are ready to take your questions.","Bill Callihan","Operator could you give our participants the instructions please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Hi, good morning. Bill or Rob I was wondering if I could get some thoughts on the timing of buybacks and kind of your philosophy on how you will balance price sensitivity versus kind of the lack of other good options to deploy your growing excess capital in this kind of environment?","Bill Demchak","I guess some generic thoughts and I got asked this I guess in the first quarter and I think my answer wasn't going to be purposely vague. We obviously -- our program has been active and as Rob stated in his comments, we're going to continue that. We look at relative price performance, outright price performance other opportunities to deploy capital. We're in a position where we're generating more capital than we're using. So, our first, second and third alternatives are kind of capital return to shareholders through dividend and repurchase. Having said that, we are sensitive to price and value certainly the extremes. I don't think we're there now, but that's something that we'll look at through time.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And Rob mentioned the flexibility to increase buybacks above the second quarter level, just as we contextualize since you\u2019re just starting, what you did this quarter; did you get a late start this quarter, because of when you did the Board approval or is that part of why you had that comment?","Bill Demchak","No, it's simply, mathematically we had a $1.5 billion we could do, we did less than the quarter of that in the first quarter. Various reasons as to why we did less, not worth worrying about. So again just mathematically, we have the capacity within our non-objected capital plans to do more, that's all that comment that was related.","Rob Reilly","Yes. And John, as you know, this is Rob, as you know we can carry over that excess capacity going forward.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then on loan growth, Bill anymore color on degree of follow through on kind of the green shoots of better line utilization that you started to see at the end of last quarter or did that follow through to the same extent you\u2019d hoped it would or can you just give some color on that?","Bill Demchak","We didn\u2019t see that -- I mean short answer is utilizations are up quarter-to-quarter largely across all lines. So we didn't -- it did hold and it went up a bit more, it didn't grow to the same extent as we saw, just at the end of the first quarter. But I think, what you see in our book is pretty consistent with some of the comments I've seen on other calls where utilization generally is up, still below historical potential. So it's not as if the economy, people are using their lines to the extent they did back in 2004 or 2005 but it's higher than it was and continues to trend up.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","So, for the year I guess Rob, are you looking for loan growth to kind of be similar to last year in the mid single-digit range for the full year this year as far as you know right now?","Rob Reilly","As far as we know right now relative to our third quarter guidance in terms of modest increases, consistent with what we've been experiencing.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And then just a quick one Rob, on the fee income outlook for that stable next quarter. Are you embedding some expectation that you'll continue to harvest the Visa gains when you say fee income stable?","Rob Reilly","No. Any Visa sales are not part of that for that guidance. What I'm saying there is that we did have some elevated gains there in the mortgage business. So the expected growth that we see in the other fee business is we look to offset that.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Rob Reilly","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Yes. Good morning. Thank you.","Bill Demchak","Hi Erika.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Hi. My first question sort of has to do with where you are on the LCR with regards to the current proposals. Could you give us an update on where you are and sort of how you are thinking about future investments in terms of your excess deposits in your bond portfolio? I did notice that your cash is up and your securities balances are down on an average basis.","Bill Demchak","Yes. Rob, why don't you hit just the LCR and talk a little bit about balances?","Rob Reilly","Well Erika, I think you can see, we continue to make progress in terms of increasing our liquidity against these proposed rules that still aren\u2019t finalized. We've been doing that now for the better part of the last three quarters or so and you've seen the effect in terms of the NIM compression related to that which was greater in past quarters than it is now. So as you know, the final finish line is fluid, but we believe we're well positioned and then that's demonstrated by the liquidity that we generated here over the last year or so.","Bill Demchak","Just with respect to deposits that we have at the Fed in the form of excess reserves and the decline in securities, I mean it's kind of self evident. We could choose if we like the rate environment to buy level one securities as opposed to put that cash on deposit and not have an effect on our LCR calculation. Just given our view on rates and investment opportunities, we've been growing the balances at the Fed. And I guess we're bit of anomaly in the industry with our security balances shrinking and for the most part maintaining that the same de minimis convexity characteristics or put differently, we're not buying mortgages that put us at risk in a higher rate environment, and we're happy with that. The opportunity cost to foregoing some interest income today is a function of interest rates I think is a worthwhile trade relative to what will happen when rates rise.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Okay. And just my follow-up question to that, it's clear that the strategic priorities implemented by the bank has -- we've seen it in the expense discipline and higher core fees, but clearly the purchase accounting accretion and to your point the conservatism in terms of investment securities purchases has driven the efficiency ratio a little bit higher quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. And I guess the question here is if we take into account an interest rate environment that doesn\u2019t necessarily shift significantly over the next four quarters, marry that with the purchase accounting accretion roll off; is there enough left in the tail in both the revenue side and the expense side on the strategic priority front that we could see the efficiency ratio start to trend down?","Bill Demchak","I mean it\u2019s a function of timing. Practically what we have in place is it relates to the southeast and growth and fees together with expense initiatives will serve us well as it relates to our efficiency ratio longer term. I can\u2019t sort of intuit over the top of my head what the next four quarters look like with respect to rate roll down if rates don\u2019t move at all. So I don\u2019t know how to think about that. What we have in place though is a long-term strategy independent of rates to make this company more efficient and less dependent on net interest income and more dependent on fees. And that is playing out.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Okay, thank you.","Bill Callihan","Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Thanks, good morning. Bill, I was hoping I could follow up on the point that you made about the fee income growth playing out. So the call is for the outlook is for stability in fee income growth in third quarter versus second quarter but that is something that is an area where you expect to see continued growth as you look out farther over time, correct?","Bill Demchak","Yes that\u2019s correct. We had some and we highlighted them in Rob\u2019s comments. We had some that we highlighted them in Rob's comments, we had some probably non-repeatable fee items in mortgage related to frankly some scratch and debt stuff that had appreciated and we sold. So, we backed that out, we're going to, we think we can overcome that through growth in core fees quarter to quarter which leads to kind of flat result.","But through time the trend lines and fees across basically all categories have been pretty strong for the last four to six quarters and we continue to play that card.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Understood. I was hoping Bill to get your thoughts on a different topic on just switching over to LCR and really the interplay between LCR and capital return. In the precrisis world excess liquidity sitting on the left hand side of balance sheets could be return to shareholders to the extent that banks were sitting on excess capital. But in a post crisis world and I guess let's say CCAR side for a second and just focus on LCR, it seems like that liquidity on the left hand side of balance sheet is needed for LCR purposes. Maybe can you comment on that dynamic and the extent to which you see LCR could potentially add to the constraint to capital return or at least make it more expensive?","Bill Demchak","Look, I don't think it will act as a constrain at all, I mean if margin I suppose it's more expensive because I'm borrowing at Libor plus something to the extent I don't have the cash on hand. But practically if you just think of the size of the two different things, we have around $16 billion $17 billion sitting at the [Multiple speakers] capital deployment and non-objective plan is $1.5 billion and repurchase is $1 billion in dividend plus or minus. So, at the margin it impacted but practically it doesn't really enter into our banking as it relates to what we'll return to shareholders.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Got it. Thanks very much for taking my questions.","Bill Callihan","You're welcome. Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Good morning.","Bill Callihan","Good morning Matt.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","On net interest income here, when we put together all the moving pieces of pretty good loan growth the lower purchase accounting and obviously still low rates, I mean at what point do we get just kind of naturally an inflection of the net interest income dollars?","Bill Demchak","Boy, we\u2019ve been waiting for it. I think off the top of my head we would have been far away from it this quarter had we chosen to carry security balances flat. We still see a drop in margin as I think through it just because of our borrowings for LCR accretion accounting and the outrage spread on loans. But we were pretty close this quarter when you back out the non-controllable and had we chosen to reinvest, we probably would have been there.","Rob Reilly","Yes. Just to expand on that Matt so that $19 million decline of that $15 million was securities balances related.","Bill Demchak","Good guess.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","I mean I guess the question is I don\u2019t blame you for wanting to stay short but just assuming kind of the medium to long part of the curves don\u2019t move and you stick to your practice of saying short. You still try to reach the natural level where (inaudible) going to go lower than net add dollars are not going to go lower. I am just trying to get the gauge or\u2026?","Bill Demchak","That\u2019s right. I mean you\u2019ve also seen the curve flattening, so with the rally and the long end over this quarter and the belly of the curve selling off which at the margin we\u2019ve been positioned for and has helped us. At some point you\u2019re right I mean if the curve stays just where it is forever we have some fairly long dated securities in there particularly the sub-investment credit would take a while to grind through the yields on those where we just to replace everything we have with that market rates.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then just separately on the capital deployment side of things. I mean how should we think about looking out over the next two to three years, I mean it feels like for banks that don't use their approve buyback in any given year under CCARs almost like use it or lose it and you've got to go back and start over the CCAR process. So like assuming we can't get payouts in excess of 100% of earnings it feels like your capital\u2019s going to build to level higher than you would might have?","Bill Demchak","Yes. That's a fair statement, I think that's an issue the whole industry faces that eventually even if you use your full, assuming you use your full allocated buyback, you get yourself to a position of without over a 100% payouts, you will continue to build capital levels in the industry. We also have and we've talked about this before that even the dividend, soft constraint at 30% of the earnings is a constraint against to your base case CCAR projections which often in our case are below what our potential to earns is.","So there is a number of issues on the table, I think eventually over a 100% is possible coming from the Fed and as we've mentioned before the alternative to choosing to do that through share repurchases is through a special dividend one-time approval I don't think that happens next year, but I think mechanically that's possible as well.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","And we assume some banks carve out gains from selling down positions to be used for additional capital deployment. So for example like in your case to be the gains might enable you to deploy more capital, are there any nuances like that that you are thinking about for I guess for the next round?","Bill Demchak","I mean the next round is the next round. I would tell you that during the course of putting together this year\u2019s plan while perhaps we were conservative under our (inaudible) we did look at the potential of how we might include these inside of that and some other things. So we think about that.","I think it issue independent of what we do but my understanding of the process by the Federal Reserve is you need a pretty hard contractual context to realize that gain so if you think about our Visa situation since it is our choice and it is dependent on future price it\u2019s tough to count that one.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay alright, thank you.","Bill Callihan","Okay. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Murray with ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Murray - ISI","Thanks, good morning.","Bill Demchak","Good morning.","Keith Murray - ISI","Want to ask you on the credit side whether the shared national credit review results were included in this quarter?","Rob Reilly","Yes, this is Rob. Yes we did include that and the snick results although we don\u2019t get specific in regard to those are not fully accounted for in our reserves.","Keith Murray - ISI","Okay. Then just go back to the efficiency ratio question, just specifically on the retail banking side, obviously you guys continue to work on branch closings and coming more efficient but when you look long-term right would assume a more normal rate backdrop what do you think a reasonable range for the efficiency ratio in that segment should be?","Bill Demchak","We are looking at each other on what the number ought to be. I have to clarify that effort inside of retail isn\u2019t about closing branches per se to save money, it\u2019s about converting our contact points with clients. So, we're reducing square footage, closing certain branches, opening others that are less square footage. And we're investing a lot of that saved money into technology and digital touch points with consumers. The end result of that is our expense base basically shrinks and our interaction with our clients increases and that is a good thing. But I just want to clarify; we're not closing branches as an isolated expense saving exercise.","The efficiency ratio long-term as you mentioned, particularly for retail is largely driven by the value of the deposits they generate which in turn are driven by where interest rates are and revenues again. So I mean they\u2019re materially under earning their potentially today vis-\u00e0-vis grades, I don't know that I have a percentage as to where that ought to go through time.","Rob Reilly","Yes. And the only thing that I would add to that just sort of qualitatively is with the migration and more and more technology and mobile deposits and alternative channels, there are lower costs vis-\u00e0-vis the traditional teller interaction over time.","Keith Murray - ISI","Fair enough. And then just lastly, maybe your crystal ball is better than others. But knowing what you know today piggyback on Matt's question, when you look out, do you think net interest income could turn the corner first before credit goes the other direction? That's a big question.","Rob Reilly","We can give several answers to the same question and obviously we're focused on it. But it's not new, it\u2019s last several quarters, it's been a race between loan growth and the spread compression. And then in this quarter a little bit more in the race on the security side, but it's plus or minus 20 million, 40 million 1%, 2%. And I think that's the environment that we're in.","Bill Demchak","I mean I would tell you that across our credit books notwithstanding some of my comments on competition and certain asset classes getting tough, the credit performance has been really good and improving largely across everything that we do. So it\u2019s not as if we\u2019re warning that somehow that\u2019s going to turn around and I don\u2019t expect that to be the case anytime in the near future. But at the same time we kind of know that we can\u2019t persist, I love to but I don\u2019t expect to persist to what was a 29 basis-point\u2026","Rob Reilly","Yes.","Bill Demchak","Charge off which is not going to happen. By the way I don\u2019t expect fed funds to be zero forever. So, all we\u2019re pointing out is those, one of those is a positive item for us in the form of rates with a lot of leverage on it for us and the other one is the negative item on normalized credit cards, that\u2019s who we are, that\u2019s what a bank does.","Keith Murray - ISI","Yes, understood. Thanks very much.","Bill Callihan","Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks. I just wanted to circle back to the NII dollars for a moment. Rob, so with the -- it seemed that all of the balance sheet dynamics ultimately pointed to was essentially a down $4 million NII figure when you adjust for the security impact. But I guess the question that that raises is to the extent that you\u2019re putting up very strong loan growth but getting price compression and at the same time funding that increasingly in wholesale format and therefore despite the balance sheet expansion not actually generating incremental dollars of revenue. How do we think about that dynamic?","Bill Demchak","I mean Rob will pile in here, but we are generating incremental dollars of revenue, right. We\u2019re just doing at a lower NIM than we had with loans and higher spreads and with free deposits from floated checking accounts.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. Perhaps I\u2019ll circle back with you, I may have misunderstood, but it seems that the NII dollars were effectively flat once made all the adjustment?","Rob Reilly","Yes, I think that's right. I think Bill was speaking specifically to the loan book there.","Bill Demchak","Yes.","Rob Reilly","So again, you just look back at the dynamics in terms of loan growth being what helps us spread compression and rates hurting us and it's a race between those three items.","Bill Demchak","Yes. You also have to remember that inside of -- so we have net loan growth, we also have re-pricings within the loan book, right. So part of the reason you see the three or four basis-point average spread compression in the loan book, it's not all the new balances that are coming on that's causing that, a lot of it is just re-pricing of existing balances through the refinancing.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Right.","Rob Reilly","It's great compression.","Bill Demchak","Yes.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Right. And as your loan to deposit ratio is creeping up a bit here into the low 90s, how are you thinking about that and particularly as you contemplate higher rates and is there some concern about what may happen with deposits and under the circumstances?","Bill Demchak","I think we spent a lot of time thinking about that. I think when rates start to move in conjunction with shrinking of the fed's balance sheet, so shrinking if [QE], we are concerned about deposit flows generically across the industry. So, if fed shrinks its balance sheet, it\u2019s going to pull deposits out of the industry. I think offsetting that somewhat is I think that the banking industry will take advantage of some of the changes in the money fund industry and actually retain balances that historically would have mode both from corporates and from individuals. The dynamics between all that are pretty complex. We spend a lot of time thinking about it. We have strategies in place to make sure that we remain core funded in our deposit profile. I think we will be able to do that, but at the same time I would tell you this will be different this time. We\u2019re going into an environment of potentially rising rates as they drain liquidity in a way that hasn\u2019t been attempted before.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. And just my last question is just on credit. The low figure that you put up in provision this quarter was driven primarily by just the low level of NCOs. And so I just wonder with respect to your guidance given that you had very little reserve release, does that reflect the expectation of some increase in NCOs maybe from lower recoveries or does it reflect the fact that you anticipate some increasing build in reserves given your balance sheet growth?","Bill Demchak","We have been wrong on our provision guidance for four quarters running. I think it reflects the fact that we continue to look at where we are and just kind of say it can\u2019t be this good.","Rob Reilly","Yes. I think that\u2019s right. And the only thing that I would add to that is we did have a release this quarter assuming everything, the economic conditions stay the same, we would have -- expect that further releases although not necessarily at these levels.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Got it. So it sounds like your bias would be low end or possibly below low end of the current guidance?","Bill Demchak","I don\u2019t know that we have a bias.","Rob Reilly","Yes, we don\u2019t have a bias, we are in day one here.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Right. Okay. Alright, thanks very much.","Bill Demchak","Thank you.","Bill Callihan","Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Bill Demchak","Hi Ken. Hello? Hello Ken?","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Guys can you hear me?","Bill Demchak","Yes, we can.","Rob Reilly","Yes.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Sorry about that. On the expense side, can you guys detail a little bit more about the automation costs that you are expecting in the third quarter, whether that's a new run rate, kind of how that's been funded by the continuous improvement expenses? And then a bigger question for next year just how much of this automation expense can we see as an acceleration to costs going forward?","Bill Demchak","Why don't I just before we get on the third quarter, one of the things that we're doing here as you think about our technology and operations streamlining agenda. We're basically using technology which eventually will give rise to greater depreciation cost. To simplify what we do and lower manual costs right people. And that will play up through time.","The third quarter comment kind of relates to some stuff that we need to do near term just on increasing demands and expectations as it relates to CCAR data requirements from Fed, we just want to stay on the top of our gain as it relates to requirements of the new regulatory regeme.","So, this is kind of some near term consulting health and some other things just to get some stuff over the hump.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","And Bill the follow up on that as you do think further out from a big picture perspective understanding that is efficiency over long-term, do you believe that you'll still be able to offset that incremental intermediate term spend with incremental continuous improvement expense once you get passed this year where you\u2019ve been pretty clear on the ability to do that this year?","Bill Demchak","Yes. That is the plan. I mean that the whole idea here is that we will not only have that offset but then build into our core technology and operations the ability to scale this company with positive operating leverage. One of the challenges we had was we were losing our ability to do that because of the manual intervention it took to grow things, we\u2019re putting everything back in the expense line. Through automation, we got to be able to scale it.","Rob Reilly","Hey and just to add to that just in terms of the expenses, just overall in terms of where we are. I do want to emphasize that expenses remain a focus point for us. We\u2019ve got to good first half of the year as you can see, by the first and second quarter. We\u2019ve got a couple of expenses specifically that Bill just talked about in the third quarter but it\u2019s a focus point. And as I said in my opening remarks we continue to believe we\u2019ll finish down year-over-year even with those investments.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay, great. And then second question just to drill down a little bit more into loan yields and understanding the shift of the move to fees from NII this quarter. Can you catalog for us explicitly where competition is pressuring loan yields the most versus the amount of lingering just negative roll over you\u2019re having from maturing loans and so is it just that competition still really punching down?","Bill Demchak","Yes. But let distinguish between a couple things, Rob can maybe give you some examples. But one issue is just that the spread on what is otherwise a good loan, right so that\u2019s a pricing issue and we\u2019re seeing competition pretty aggressive inside of the middle market space. And by the way we could be accused of that as well, we\u2019ll protect our existing clients where we have a lot of cross-sell by being aggressive on loan pricing. The other issue out there that concerns me more is on structure and we're seeing in small business and smaller commercial tenders extending collateral values deteriorating a lot of things going into those structures where we would just choose not to compete independent or what the price was. Consumer side we're seeing, you'll see our growth in auto has slowed, we expect that kind of continue as tenders and LTVs on car loans have worsen. So pricing we can deal with, the good loan is a good loan you don't earn as much today, but you do tomorrow to the relationship structure raises.","Rob Reilly","Guys what I would add to that, I would just focus on sort of the core compression, spread compression which has been around three basis points. So that excludes the reclassification and all system purchase accounting around the yield. So I just feel right at that 3% which has been largely consistent with what we've been experiencing for the better part of the year under this, I'm sorry, three basis points which has been largely consistent with what we have been experiencing, actually a basis point lower, it's kind of around four to five.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay. Thanks guys.","Bill Callihan","Sure. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Miller - FBR","Yes. Thank you very much. And can you talk a little bit about I would have to jump it all around, I don't know exactly everything you said. But on your re-performing loan sales, do you say -- I know there is a lot of people feel that there is a great opportunity be selling re-performing loans into the market. Do you foresee selling more loans going forward?","Rob Reilly","Yes. They are different things obviously to project or forecast. We have had loan sales during the last couple of quarters. What I wanted to point out was that the second quarter rather in our judgment had elevated levels around that.","Bill Demchak","And it\u2019s not -- and they are fair value assets out there.","Rob Reilly","Yes.","Bill Demchak","So in fact we sell them or not they are getting written up based on market values.","Paul Miller - FBR","And then on you might have talked about this already but utilization rates. We have heard from a couple of institution that they are up. I don\u2019t think you have really disclosed it in your documents, can you talk little bit about are you seeing increase in utilization rates?","Bill Demchak","No we did talk about it. They are up from the first quarter which was elevated from the end of the year pretty much overall categories they are not it\u2019s not necessarily anything to write home about they are up half a percent across different categories. Still well below their potential relative to past cycles, but the trend is good. And that increase in utilization is part of what gave rise to the loan growth this quarter.","Paul Miller - FBR","Okay, guys thank you very much.","Bill Demchak","Yes.","Bill Callihan","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please proceed with your questions.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Thank you. Good morning guys.","Bill Demchak","Hey Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Can you give us an idea if we had a 100 basis point move a parallel shift in the yield curve both the front end and long end going up what type of increase to net interest income could be achieved?","Bill Demchak","We have that and let Callihan kind of\u2026","Bill Callihan","It\u2019s 2% in the first year.","Bill Demchak","The challenge with that measure that we disclosed in the Q assumes that we don\u2019t actually increase our investment profile alone to 2%. So 2% and in fact saying that we would just replace what we hold today as opposed to increasing what we hold which is in fact what we would do.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Right.","Bill Demchak","It's a material number. Front end helps us in many ways near term more than the back end.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Okay. Coming back to Rob, you mentioned the gain on sale margin was obviously over 5% this quarter which was helped by some of the fair value marks.","Rob Reilly","Yes.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","And on the fair value marks, I think Bill you said it was because of the scratch and dent loans in that, is that what helps you guys on the fair value marks on the mortgage side?","Bill Demchak","Yes, essentially it's loans that we took back from whatever reason from various government agencies and cured them through time and or just through collateral values underlying the loan because the house price appreciation allowed the value of those to increase.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Okay. So when you -- Rob, when you mentioned heading more toward the 300 basis points on sale margin going forward, is it primarily due to the fair value marks not being there?","Rob Reilly","That's exactly right, Gerard. Yes, that's exactly right.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Okay. When you guys take a look at -- you gave us some guidance, I just wonder I can get a clarification here on the fee revenue that\u2019s going to be stable in the third quarter. You indicated that the Visa gains were not included in the third quarter assumptions. Is it also we should back them out of the second quarter number spend when you stable would be apples to apples?","Rob Reilly","Yes, that's right, that's right. The distinction as it's between fee income and then total other non-interest income or a total non-interest income which includes other; Visa is in the part of the other.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Great. And then finally, obviously your Tier I common ratio is very strong at 10%. Bill, is it safe for us to assume you mentioned that you are growing capital faster than you could redeploy it that the total [ask] in next year\u2019s CCAR should be closer to a 100% than where we are today, which I think is around 65%?","Bill Demchak","I don't know. You shouldn't assume anything in the middle of July without any instructions coming out of the fed or any expectations coming out of the fed as it relates to the \u201814 CCAR.","Rob Reilly","And argue for the industry.","Bill Demchak","Yes. I mean look, we\u2019re running at levels right now beyond what we would say is our need. So, I\u2019ll leave that as a statement and we\u2019ll see what plays out in the environment and where the fed comes back with next year\u2019s process.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Great. Thank you guys.","Bill Demchak","Yes. Thanks Gerard.","Bill Callihan","Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Great, thanks. And most of my questions have actually been asked and answered but just kind of a follow-up on the net interest income. As I look back to what you said three months ago, you talked about that purchase accounting accretion that really didn\u2019t change and you talked about some of the other things. I am not sure that you\u2019ve talked so much about the general kind of spread compression. I mean, did your kind of view on that kind of soften during this quarter or is that a change or is that not, am I just reading too much into it?","Bill Demchak","We\u2019ve been rolling three or four basis points a quarter.","Rob Reilly","For the last year and half. Just\u2026","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Okay. So your view is that it hasn\u2019t really changed that it\u2019s just pretty much...","Bill Demchak","Yes, that\u2019s right.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Okay. Alright. Thanks very much.","Bill Demchak","Yes. Thanks very much.","Bill Callihan","Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Hi, thanks. Just on the expenses and I know we talked a lot about that already today. You are obviously indicating that 2014 expenses anticipated come below 2013. You\u2019re two thirds the way through the CIP program, not as much of this quarter CIP fell to the bottom-line because of things like (inaudible) I am just wondering based on what I am hearing that expectation is that more of your CIP program will likely fall to the bottom-line in 3Q and 4Q that's my read between the line, is that accurate?","Rob Reilly","Yes, I think that's accurate. Yes, It's an annual program. We continue to do, continue to go after expense savings part of that program and even beyond that. So we would expect to get savings in the third quarter from our continuous improvement programs.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","And it would fall more to the bottom line as did in second quarter?","Bill Demchak","Danger with the continuous improvement program is because while we save the money that the better guidance is the direct guidance on what we expect expenses to do in totality in a quarter. And the comments going from second to third was we continued slight jump on the back of this automation and regulatory stuff and some seasonality we\u2019re having in employee (inaudible).","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Got it.","Bill Demchak","It continues, it's important internally because it gives employees something to focus on as it relates to recycle dollars, but it\u2019s a practical matter externally in the way you model our income statement, I would just focus on the guidance.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then obviously continuous is important and the continuous improvement from NIM, so the fact that your two-thirds away through this year, I don't think we should take to mean that your original end game for this year is setting stone, I mean that could increase?","Rob Reilly","That's possible. That is what occurred last year.","Bill Demchak","Yes. Look, we never give up.","Rob Reilly","That's right. We never give up. That's right.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks.","Bill Callihan","Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Hi.","Bill Demchak","Hi Mike.","Rob Reilly","Hi Mike.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","My first question is a high level one. One of your main strategic initiatives is to improve the performance of the new markets, the Southeast and the Midwest up to the level of the Northeast. You have indicated in some presentations cross-sell rates and things like that but can you just give us a comparison of new markets versus legacy markets on efficiency, ROA or some other metrics like that?","Bill Demchak","Just trying to think back to we used some of this in one of the presentations.","Rob Reilly","About 10% of our -- Southeast represents about 10% of our revenues.","Bill Demchak","I mean it\u2019s today the region as a whole contributes to the bottom line in a healthy way but it\u2019s materially below its potential relative to what we see elsewhere if that\u2019s what you are kind of driving at. At the same time it\u2019s growing at a pace across every line of business that is faster than the legacy businesses. So if you are looking for longer term potential, it\u2019s a material number to the company with a high degree of difficulty and a lot of years to play out.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Yes, I was looking for a little more definition of material or below potential again just efficiency ratio by market.","Bill Demchak","Yes, we have that out in some public records, why don\u2019t you get that from Bill?","Bill Callihan","Mike, we can talk offline, I have got couple of things out there from a presentation we can go through.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Sure. No, I look at that. If in the future you are able to quantify even more with more specifics, it might be helpful to communicate that, that\u2019s fine. Separately, your efficiency ratio, it has gone the wrong direction from 59% to 61% in the past year second quarter versus second quarter and I guess in the third quarter it will still get a little bit worse since expenses will be up for per your guidance and revenues would be down a little bit per guidance and this is the same time you have gotten most of the savings from CIP. I guess is that just further prior quest you are just reinvesting the benefit or it's just a tough environment and you are making a best of that situation. How should we think of that?","Bill Demchak","I mean look at the end of the day, we are a cyclical bank inside of a cyclical industry with declining revenue that's coming on the back of spread compression rates and accretion accounting right.","I can, we can control expenses, which we are doing and we can run our company. The end result of that because of the cyclical factors is our expectation and we put that up here in our guidance, it\u2019s going to get a little worse in the third quarter.","I can offset that and choose to do things that don't make long-term economic sense to us. We could grow our securities book, we could start balance sheet in mortgages, we could make that number anything you want it in the near term. I just don't think that's the right way to run a company.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","And as a follow up to that, without using a word convexity, can you explain again why it makes sense for PNC to be an anomaly when it comes to shrinking the securities book? And with -- I do remember, yes, you were in a call before the financial crisis and you highlighted that correctly. So, maybe it's here an anomaly more people should pay attention, I'm serious?","Bill Demchak","Well all we're saying in the securities book. So, the disclosure around these books is not always terrific, you basically have a notional amount, you kind of have categories and then we put out an average maturity or average duration. What is missing is the convexity associated with it.","So, the duration, the current duration of the current coupon mortgage is pretty short, because of prepay rates. If rates go up, it extends massively that's negative convexity. So, I could have the same notional securities book with the same average life at somebody else. And we think we have a much better risk profile, because our book is not extend in a rising rate environment of this rolled out and occur and then disappear on a low average life for others people who will extent. Same way it will appear at balance sheet in mortgages as opposed to putting up through to the agencies.","That\u2019s all we\u2019re seeing. It\u2019s an opportunity cuts. We could choose to take that risk. I just think that the risk return of the benefit for the probably of lower rates and being able to write down this curve versus extending in higher rates, yes, I think there is more downside than upside.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","How much is that opportunity cost in your view? I mean if you did what some others do or what you could do how much of it revenue pick up could that be?","Bill Demchak","Couple of hundred million, pretty easy.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","That\u2019s per year?","Bill Demchak","Yes. Pretty easy, yes.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","So that\u2019s in a way, and insurance policy against a negative impact from higher interest rates when they occur?","Bill Demchak","Yes, I mean we\u2019re just, I would rather have the upside leverage in a higher rate environment, rather than rates go up and you\u2019re basically bound because your assets have extended and you can\u2019t deploy into the new higher rates, at the same time as your funding costs go up. All right?","Mike Mayo - CLSA","All right. Yes, no, that I get it. And the last question, as far as the purchase accounting accretion, you said that should hurt $300 million this year. How much has that hurt already?","Rob Reilly","It\u2019s right about there about 150. It isn\u2019t the exact number but it\u2019s right on schedule.","Bill Demchak","It hurts every day.","Rob Reilly","Yes, it hurts every day. I think it\u2019s an exact number but generally it\u2019s right at the half level.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","And you said another 225 next year, so next year is that when conceptually the reported net interest margin this quarter 312 intersects with the core net interest margin 292 or is there more in 2016?","Rob Reilly","There\u2019ll be more.","Bill Demchak","It trends the level, I mean it's going to trend, it's such a small percentage that it ought to be dwarfed by other thing.","Rob Reilly","And those two NIMs will converge.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Is that more National City or RBC?","Bill Demchak","It's more National City.","Bill Demchak","It's more the impaired books, Mike.","Rob Reilly","Yes.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Okay, great, alright. Thank you.","Bill Callihan","Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell from Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning, guys. Just one additional question on margin compressions for Rob I guess. Rob, if you characterize your positioning relative to LCR, and I realize the rules are not finals.","Rob Reilly","Yes.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","If you have three basis points of compression this quarter from LCR, at what point do you think that might go down to no effects on margin quarter-over-quarter from your activity to prepare for LCR?","Rob Reilly","Sure. Of course that's hard to answer definitively, because the final rules aren\u2019t established. But what I said in previous earnings calls and I\u2019ll say here is we believe the majority of the work is behind us and the majority of the NIM compression is behind us and you can see that late fourth quarter, I think it was something like 7 basis points of compression and then it was four and now it\u2019s three. So we\u2019re close here and the majority of the work is behind us.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. And then I guess a bigger picture question, I mean if you look at your average consumer loan balances, they\u2019ve been pretty flattish year-over-year, not growing as much as the commercial side of things and I suspect some of that\u2019s demand rather than your underwriting. But if the employment situation continues to improve net worth -- household net worth has improved fairly materially over the last couple of years. How you\u2019re thinking about potentially tweaking your lending standards on the consumer side to potentially grow that book at yields that are presumably a bit better than you are getting on the consumer side, sorry, on the commercial side?","Bill Demchak","Yes, first off, inside of our consumer balance sheet as it were, we have sort of mechanical run off in our education lending book which hits us every quarter, so that\u2019s the old government guaranteed program that no longer exist and that just rolls down. We had environmental as a function of rate declines or flat balances inside of home equity. We have offset those with growth in credit card and auto. And on the small business side which ought to be a big piece of it, we have been kind of trending flat to down as run off in some of the non-core books from RBC and still National City are offset by new business generation. One thing, we look at risk return on all of our credit products on a relationship basis. So the notion that something yields more to us, why don\u2019t I go chase that it\u2019s kind of be on a loss adjusted basis. We think we have had our credit box pretty much defined and consistent for the last bunch of years and I don\u2019t know that we are inclined to change it.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","And within the areas of consumer lending that you are targeting, have you seen any greater level of demand based on as I said somewhat improved net worth situation and the job?","Bill Demchak","Look, we have seen, whole industry has seen just the back of strength within auto which is kind of got back to pre-crisis levels. We have seen growth in auto lending, we have seen partly as a function of our opportunity because we were underpenetrated and we have seen growth in card balances well beyond what you would expect in a normal environment. Look, and Chairman spoke about it yesterday, there is still a constraint on consumer wages notwithstanding on improved employment picture. And until that changes and consumer spending changes materially which will drive the whole account, I don't expect to see a big lift in consumer credit.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. Thank you very much.","Bill Callihan","Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stern Agee. Please proceed with your question.","Terry McEvoy - Stern Agee","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just a question Bill, in your prepared remarks you said that the first half of \u201814 was largely in line with plans. And I'm just wondering where you are not tracking within in plans, is that just a function of issues out of your control, we talked about spread compression et cetera or is anything connected to execution on expense cutting, growing in certain markets et cetera that you had assumed would have fallen in place in the first half of the year?","Bill Demchak","I would tell you, it's a great question and thank you for asking. Look, we are -- the things within our control that we can execute on in our strategic priorities, we feel really good about from the Southeast to the change in what we're doing in mortgage to wealth growth to the focus on cross-sell inside of C&I and importantly on our technology agenda. So we feel good about that.","The environmental stuff, we would have had in our forecast rates higher today, not front end rates, but we would have the tenure higher which would have lifted the whole curve and that would head our net interest income higher than where we sit. But that I can't do anything about. The stuff that we can execute on, the company and the employees have just done a phenomenal job and I couldn't be happier with them.","Bill Callihan","Thank you very much. And we\u2019re now past probably the time. So, I think Bill that's a great way to close the call or should we have any other comments?","Bill Demchak","No, we\u2019ve been asked this for an hour 11, we\u2019ve talked as much about net interest income as I can think about it. Thank you guys again for your time and your interest and we\u2019ll see again in the third quarter.","Bill Callihan","Operator, close the call.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Our return on average assets for the quarter was 1.19%.","Second quarter was largely a success for PNC despite low interest rates that continue to pressure net interest income across the industry. We grew average loans slightly linked quarter, driven by our specialty businesses in the corporate and institutional bank and we were up 3% year-over-year.","Average deposits were up $4.8 billion or about 2% linked quarter. Expenses were well managed, although there are some moving pieces this quarter and Rob is going to step through that in some detail during his comments.","Importantly, fee income grew 7% this quarter and 5% year-over-year as a result of our continued execution against our strategic priorities. As we said in the past, our priorities are aligned to deepen customer relationships and drive fee income growth, which enables us to create long-term shareholder value even in a low interest environment and we are making important progress against each of our strategic priorities.","We continue to make good progress in building a leading banking franchise in the Southeast. On the corporate side, Southeast loans, revenues and cross-sell hit their highest quarterly levels since the acquisition of RBC Bank USA. In retail, loan and deposit account growth continues to outpace our other markets.","Asset management also had a good quarter with new primary client acquisition accelerating both, the year-over-year and linked quarter. In addition, fee income grew both, quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. In retail, we continue to make important strides to transform the customer experience in accordance with evolving customer preferences.","We continue to optimize our branch network. In fact, by the end of this year, we expect we will have closed or consolidated more than 400 branches, reducing the overall network by more than 10% since the acquisition of RBC Bank USA, while continuing to serve our communities. This includes plans to consolidate 100 branches this year.","In the second quarter, we saw primary digital channel usage among our customers exceed 50% for the first time and non-teller deposit transactions via ATM and mobile are up almost 25% over the second quarter a year ago. We now have more than 300 branches operating under the universal model.","Customers of universal branches have a higher percentage of deposit transactions via ATM and mobile and these branches complement the variety of touch points we have created to serve our customers in the ways that they want to bank with us.","We are proactively engaging with our customers to set appointments for them to come and to talk with us about their financial needs. We have expanded this. We started this last year and we expanded it across the retail network and our customers are responding. Today, through this program, we have contacted more than 1.2 million customers resulted in more than 350,000 scheduled appointments, which in turn have led to more than 100,000 new product sales as we learn about their needs and they learn about the range of our products.","Importantly, throughout all this, we remain a Main Street bank organized around the relationships we enjoy with the people in businesses we serve. Another area, where you have heard us talk about improving the customer experience is in residential mortgage banking, we and everybody else has spent a lot of time the last few years looking backward at systemic problems that plagued the mortgage industry for years.","While there is still work to do, we can now begin to think more strategically about the future of our home lending business and the relative experience for our customers.","In the second quarter, we were very pleased with the OCC's announcement that PNC was one of three mortgage service providers that had satisfied all of the requirements under the OCC's mortgage consent orders.","As it relates to technology and operations, we are about midway through our multi-year effort to modernize our infrastructure and improve efficiency. Our efforts are on plan and we are beginning to see the benefits of our investments to make our technology infrastructure more secure, more reliable and more scalable.","On the whole, it was a successful quarter for PNC. From a macro perspective, the operating environment is pretty much what we expected it to be at this point in the year. We continue to await some definitive indication of when interest rates will begin to rise, but in the meantime we are executing well on the things we can control.","Furthermore, we remain sensitive to the revenue expense relationship and are in the midst of taking a number of actions to reduce operating expenses, particularly as we move into '16 and Rob is going to give you more detail in a few minutes.","As we look to the second half, I am confident that we have the right people, the right model and culture to continue to deliver a superior banking experience for our customers and to create long-term value for shareholders.","With that, I will turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our second quarter results and then we will take your questions. Rob?","Rob Reilly","Yes. Thanks Bill. Good morning, everyone. Overall, we had a strong second quarter with results that they are largely consistent with our expectations.","Second quarter net income was a $1 billion or $1.88 per diluted common share. These results were driven by strong fee income performance, continued earning asset and deposit growth, well-controlled expenses and improvements in credit quality.","Our balance sheet on Slide 4, and is presented on an average basis. As you can see, total assets increased by $4.6 billion or 1% compared to the first quarter. Commercial lending was up $1.4 billion or 1% from the first quarter, which as expected was at slower pace from previous quarters. The growth was driven by our specialty businesses, including commercial real estate and asset-based lending and by strong volumes around M&A financing in our large corporate business. To a lesser extent, modest utilization increases also contributed to the growth.","Consumer lending declined $1.2 billion or 2% of which more than $300 million was due to the run-off of non-strategic assets, with the balance primarily due to decreases in home equity and education loans.","Investment securities were up $2.3 billion or 4% linked quarter, substantially funded by deposit growth. Lastly, our interest earning deposits with banks, primarily with the Federal Reserve, increased in the second quarter commensurate with our liquidity management activities and strong deposit growth.","On the liability side, total deposits increased by $4.8 billion or 2% when compared to the first quarter, driven by higher levels of demand money market deposits.","Borrowed funds increased by more than $800 million or 1% on a linked quarter basis. We optimized our funding structure in light of a regulatory liquidity standards and a rating agency methodology change. As such, we issued senior bank notes, bank borrowings increased and we reduced commercial paper.","Total equity remained stable in the second quarter compared to the first quarter as retained earnings were essentially offset by capital returns as well as a decrease in AOCI.","Our interest earning deposits primarily with the Federal Reserve were $32.4 billion as of June 30th, an increase of $17.7 billion or 121% compared to the same time a year ago in part to comply with liquidity coverage standards, but also reflecting strong deposit growth.","As you know, the Federal Reserve short-term liquidity coverage ratio went into effect on January 1, 2015, and as of June 30th, our estimated ratio exceeded 100% for both, the bank and bank holding company, under the month end calculation methodology.","Turning to Slide 5, we continue to maintain strong capital levels while delivering significant shareholder capital return. During the second quarter, we repurchased 5.9 million common shares for approximately $600 million. This is part of our repurchase authorization of up to $2.875 billion for the five-quarter period, which began April 1, 2015.","Period end common shares outstanding were 515 million, down 4 million linked quarter and 16 million compared to the same time a year ago.","Risk-weighted assets on a fully phased standardized approach were essentially flat on the linked quarter basis. As of June 30, 2015, our pro forma Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio also fully phased in and using standardized approach was estimated to be 10%. Finally, our tangible book value was $61.75 per common share as of June 30th, a 6% increase compared to the same period a year ago.","Turning to our income statement on Slide 6, net income was just over $1 billion and our return on average assets was 1.19%. Our second quarter performance delivered revenue growth of $135 million or 4% on a linked quarter basis. These results were driven by strong fee income in virtually all category partially offset by a small decline in net interest income. Expenses remained well-controlled and we experienced improved credit quality.","Let me highlight a few items in our income statement, core net interest income was relatively stable as higher earning assets were offset by lower yields and higher deposit expense. Overall, net interest income declined by $20 million or 1% compared to the first quarter due to lower purchase accounting accretion.","Non-interest income increased to $155 million or 9% linked quarter due to strong fee income growth and higher gains on asset sales. Non-interest expense increased by $70 million or 1% compared to the first quarter as we continue to focus on disciplined expense management.","This quarter's results include a change in the application of how we account for historic tax credits, and I will have more to say about that in a moment. Provision in the second quarter was $46 million, down $8 million or 15% from the first quarter.","Now, let us discuss the key drivers of this performance in greater detail.","Turning to net interest income on Slide 7, average interest earning assets grew by $5 billion or 2% linked quarter, primarily due to increased security balances, higher liquidity positions and modest loan growth.","Core NII was relatively stable compared to the first quarter, driven by growth in earning assets funded by core deposits. Purchase accounting accretion declined by $17 million linked quarter. As a results, total net interest income decreased by $20 million linked quarter.","Net interest margin declined nine basis points linked quarter, primarily due to purchase accounting accretion and our increased liquidity position.","Regarding purchase accounting, given the higher than anticipated cash recoveries we experience in the first half of the year, we have revised our forecast by $25 million. As a result, we now expect purchase accounting accretion to be down for the full year approximately $200 million when compared to 2014 versus the previous guidance of $225 million.","In terms of our interest rate sensitivity, our duration of equity remains negative. As you know, our balance sheet is asset-sensitive reflecting our view of the interest rate environment. As we said that some time, we recognize it has and will possibly continue to constrain our NII growth in the short-term.","However, when interest rates do begin to rise, we are well-positioned and we will continue to apply a measured approach to higher levels of investment activity.","Turning to non-interest income on Slide 8, overall strong performance across our diversified businesses generated an increase in fee income of $91 million or 7% this quarter. Equally important, year-over-year fee income increased by $73 million or 5% reflecting our strategic priorities to grow higher quality and more sustainable revenue streams.","Total non-interest income increased by $155 million or 9% linked quarter, driven by core fee growth and higher gains on asset sales, asset management fees increased by $40 million or 11% on the linked-quarter basis.","During the quarter, we had a substantial trust settlement resulting in fees of approximately $30 million. In addition, market performance and new sales production also contributed to the increase.","Compared to the same quarter a year ago, asset management fees increased by $54 million or 15%, excluding the substantial trust settlement in the second quarter, asset management fees were up $24 million or 7%, primarily due to market performance, net new business and BlackRock earnings.","Assets under administration were $262 billion as of June 30th, up $5 billion or 2% compared to the same period a year ago. Reflecting our strategy of growing share of wallet in retail, consumer service fees were up $23 million or 7% linked quarter, with increases in all primary categories reflecting seasonality and higher client activity.","Corporate services fees increased by $25 million or 7% linked quarter. Compared the same period a year ago, they increased by $26 million or 8%. In both periods, the growth was primarily due to increases in treasury management and capital market advisory fees.","Residential mortgage non-interest income was flat compared to the first quarter as double-digit originations growth was offset by our first quarter portfolio sale. Mortgage originations were $2.9 billion in the second quarter, up from $2.6 billion the same quarter a year ago, a 14% increase.","Services charges on deposits grew by $3 million or 2% linked quarter, primarily due to seasonality and higher client activity. Compared the same quarter a year ago, deposit service charges declined slightly as a result of evolving customer behavior related to product changes.","Other categories of non-interest income increased by $64 million, primarily from gains on the sale of Visa stock offset by lower net securities gains.","Total non-interest income to total revenue was 47% in the second quarter, up three percentage points both, linked quarter and the same quarter a year ago.","Turning to expenses on Slide 9; second quarter levels increased by $70 million or 1% as we continue to focus on disciplined expense management. We recorded a $43 million increase in personnel costs in the second quarter, resulting from higher variable compensation costs associated with elevated business activity. In addition, equipment cost increased reflecting our investments in technology and the bank transformation.","Partially offsetting these increases was a change in the application of $54 million of year-to-date historic tax credits to related asset investment balances. This had the effect of lowering impairment expense and correspondingly increasing income tax expense.","In simple terms, because of this change, non-interest expenses decreased by essentially the same amount of the income tax increase, and by definition is EPS-neutral. We made this change in presentation to better align with industry practice.","As a result, our second quarter effective tax rate was 28.2%, up from 24.4% in the first quarter. With this change, we now expect our full year effective tax rate to be 26%. As you know, the goal of our 2015 continued improvement program is to reduce costs to fund the investments we are making in technology infrastructure and retail transformation.","In our first quarter earnings call, we referenced an effort to enhance expense savings over and above CIP target of $400 million. During the last couple of months, we have identified initiatives that support increasing our CIP goal by an additional $100 million. As a result, we have raised our 2015 CIP goal to $500 million.","When looking at the full year 2015 expense forecast, take into account the benefit of the tax credit change and the additional CIP, partially offset by higher variable incentive comp and investments related to equipment expenses. We have revised our full-year 2015 guidance from stable expenses to down approximately 1% compared to full year 2014 expenses.","As you can see on Slide 10, overall credit quality improved in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Non-performing loans were down $153 million or 6% compared to the first quarter as we saw continued improvements across our commercial and consumer loan portfolios.","Total past due loans decreased by $109 million or 6% linked quarter. Net charge-offs of $67 million declined by $36 million or 35%, primarily due to strong recoveries in commercial lending. In the second quarter, the net charge-off ratio was 13 basis points of average loans, down from 20 basis points in the prior quarter.","Our provision of $46 million declined $8 million or 15% linked quarter as overall credit quality improved. Finally, the allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans is 1.59% as of June 30th. This compares to 1.72% at the same time a year ago.","As you know the shared national credit exam has been completed and our results are fully reflected in this quarter's reserves. In regard to our oil and gas exposure, we have a total of $2.6 billion in outstandings, which is down about 10% from the first quarter and still represents about 2% of our total commercial lending portfolio.","Of the $2.6 billion, approximately $300 million is not asset based or investment grade. In our view, these loans have the potential to be the most impacted by the drop in oil prices and we continue to monitor these loans closely. Importantly, we remain comfortable with our current reserve levels based on our continuing review of the portfolio.","In summary, PNC posted strong second quarter earnings consistent with our expectations. We continue to believe the domestic economy will expand at a steady pace this year. Our plans assume the Federal Reserve will begin to raise short-term interest rates beginning in September.","Given this background, we expect total revenues to continue to be under pressure, primarily as a result of lower purchase accounting accretion. As I said earlier, we now expect full year 2015 expenses to be lower compared to full year 2014.","Looking ahead to the third quarter and when compared to the second quarter reported results, we expect modest loan growth, we expect net interest income to remain stable, we expect fee income to be stable as we anticipate the continued growth and business activity in the third quarter to effectively equal the elevated second quarter trust settlement fees. We expect expenses to be stable and we expect provision to be between $50 million and $100 million.","With that Bill and I are ready to take your questions.","Bill Demchak","Operator, can you give our participants instructions please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Erika Najarian","Yes. Good morning.","Bill Demchak","Good morning, Erika.","Rob Reilly","Good morning.","Erika Najarian","My first question on the base for the fee income guidance for next quarter, are we keeping the $30 million unusually large trust settlement in the base? If so, what is usual run rate of trust settlements that you typically recognize and where is the core growth coming from if that is indeed included in the base of your guidance?","Rob Reilly","Sure. Good morning. This is Rob. The answer of the part one of your questions is, yes, it is the base, so we do expect across all of our fee categories in third quarter to effectively grow those consistent with our strategies in an amount equal to that 30 million trust fee and that is we had guidance in terms of being stable.","In regard to the second part of your question in terms of the trust settlement fees, that is a routine thing that happens in terms of any trust business. What is unusual about this one is it happens to be one of our largest trust and the period in terms of which was involved with was particularly long, so that is why we called it out. The usual run rate of settlement fees is in the low millions of dollars in particular quarters, so this one is not unusual by it size.","Erika Najarian","Got it. My second question is for Bill. We have been asking your peers over the past few calls in terms of their take on deposit beta and hopeful anticipation of a rising rate environment in back half of this year. JPMorgan mentioned that they think that the betas there are going to be much greater, because of new regulatory standards. Wells took a softer stance saying that we are coming from zero and USB was somewhere down to middle. Where do you stand?","Bill Demchak","We are probably closer aligned to JPMorgan, and I think there is going to be a pressure, particularly on the retail side, just given the differentiation in LCR qualification retail deposits versus wholesale.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you.","Bill Callihan","Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Bill Demchak","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Siefers","Good morning guys. Rob maybe best for you just I want to make sure I am starting off the right base on the expense guidance for the full year down 1%.","Bill Demchak","Yes.","Scott Siefers","Is that off the reported at $9.488 billion from last year or I assume recalling the fourth quarter last year you had something like $125 million of unusual costs, which would have taken it lower, but whatever the base is?","Rob Reilly","Yes. Sure. It's off the reported numbers.","Scott Siefers","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Rob Reilly","Sure.","Scott Siefers","Then maybe just another question on kind of how are you thinking about the margin and balance sheet growth dynamics as we look for a stable NII into the third quarter? I appreciate your updated thoughts on the purchase accounting down, I think you said down $200 million.","As you look at things, so is margin pressure abating in part because of that which allows you to do NII, or are you thinking you grow at a more rapid clip? How do you see the interplay coming out?","Rob Reilly","Well, there are a couple of things going on there. On the purchase accounting accretion, the revision there really reflects greater than expected recoveries in the first half of the year, so that is a good thing.","We keep saying as we get deeper into this, the opportunity for recoveries becomes less but because they were so substantial in the first half, we have revised that to down $200 million versus to $225 million.","In terms of stable NII, it is pretty much consistent with the theme that we have been saying all year, fighting the lower rates offsetting that with modest growth in our loan portfolio, which we expect to continue albeit at a somewhat slower rate than what we have done historically and putting some more money to work in investment securities in a measured approach.","Scott Siefers","Okay. Good. I think that is great. Thank you very much.","Rob Reilly","Sure.","Bill Callihan","Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning.","Bill Demchak","Good morning, Matt.","Matt O'Connor","Can you just talk about the desire to deploy some of the liquidity? Last quarter, I know you added to the securities book, but if we look over a longer-term period it does not seem like you have kind of built the securities or mortgage book as much as we have seen in some other banks and obviously rates have backed up a little bit here, so just curious on thoughts of easing into it around these levels.","Bill Demchak","Yes. Tactically, if you look through time the securities book would kind of go up or down depending on where we were in long-term rates independent of the front rates being zero. We have obviously sold off in the back and a lot since the end of the first quarter and that is part of the reason you see our security balances increasing and you will likely see them increase as we go forward and just kind of step our way into what we think is going to be a rising rate environment.","We have an ability against, I do not know what it is, $32 billion, we have sitting at the fed today. We can obviously redeployed most if not all of that into other interest-bearing assets Level 1 LCR and then some percentage of Level 2, where we still have, what is it 40%?","Rob Reilly","$13 billion.","Bill Demchak","\u2026so big number that we could put into Level 2, but that's all against - We do not think about where you put the cash, we think about it in terms of the duration, the balance sheet and where we are investing in long-term rates, which can be done through swaps, through loans, buying securities and reducing cash.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. Then just separately on expenses, as we look maybe a little bit more than just the next couple of quarters and think about next year, you know, maybe we get less benefit from rates than folks saw just six months ago. What are your thoughts on being able to control costs in a still low rate environment as we look out beyond this year?","Rob Reilly","Yes. Sure Matt. This is Rob. We are not in position to be able to give guidance on '16 specifically yet, we will get to that when we set our budget up in the fall and get a feel for where we are particularly around interest rates, but the message that we want to convey again this morning is that we are very mindful of the revenue-expense relationship.","We do feel in terms of the way that rates were pushed out, our expectations of a rate rise were pushed out there in first quarter earnings call necessitated this additional push on expenses which is why we raised our CIP target.","Bill Demchak","Just as an aside, part of the story on expenses this quarter in variable comp, Rob talked about basically out of variable incentive as well as pretty much expected equipment cost increases as we continue with the technology agenda.","On the variable comp piece, perversely at the start of the year, we changed some of our incentive programs in retail to drive deposit growth, which we have absolutely gotten. You see the acceleration in our deposit growth on the retail side.","What we have not gotten is the value from that growth in deposits is rates against our original forecast to remain lower for longer, so the pop in incentive comp, but we can get the offsetting revenue and it is something we have an ability to dial as we go through the rest of this year.","Rob Reilly","Yes. What I would add to that too is, I would encourage you to focus on the full year expense management. We can get as I said this for a number of years, we can get quarterly fluctuations around those types of things and also our pace of investments that are not necessarily uniform to the quarter, but are for the year.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. Thank you very much.","Bill Callihan","Next question please?","Operator","Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning guys.","Bill Demchak","Good morning.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you guys share with us your thoughts, you mentioned that you are likely to close I think another 100 branches this year for a total of 400 over the last three or four years.","Bill Demchak","Yes.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you share with us the deposit retention? What kind of numbers are you seeing when you consolidate these branches? Are you keeping 90% to 95% of the deposits?","Rob Reilly","Yes. Hey, Gerard, it is Rob. A couple of things there, one is as Bill mentioned, we have plans to consolidate 100 branches in total for 2015, 50 of which have already been consolidated, so there is an additional 50.","So far in terms of what we have done in terms of these consolidations, the deposit retention has been very high. I do not have an exact number for you, but obviously that is one of the sensitivities and we manage it pretty closely.","Gerard Cassidy","What type of feedback have you received from your customers whether it has been positive or negative on these consolidations?","Bill Demchak","More often than not, it is not positive, but having said that we have very long lead times in advanced warning to affected customers and warm handoffs on moving people up to their branches.","As you would expect, we get the occasional complaint when we do consolidations, but we are quite thoughtful about how we go about it in the lead time, the lead times associated with notifications and follow-up customer service.","Gerard Cassidy","You have talked over the last couple of years about the upgrading of the internal technology and it looks like the light at the end of the tunnel comes possibly in the second half of next year or toward the end of next year.","After that is finished, can you give us your views on what you are thinking about mergers and acquisitions once this task is behind you and you may have a better ability of doing something on a go-forward basis?","Bill Demchak","Sure. I think, we said looking backwards that our technology agenda trumped our desire to look at retail bank acquisitions. We did want to stop what we were doing, to do integration. When the technology agenda is at a point where we can in fact do that, it does not mean that we are then going to get into an acquisition game.","We will look at the environment at that point in time, look at values in the market and look at in our strategic needs and opportunities and have a view, but that is a year and a year-and-a-half from now.","It will depend on rate environment, it will depend on the continued change in retail preferences and the transformation we are going through and we will evaluate it when we get there.","Gerard Cassidy","Just one final thing on the technology, some banks that have done similar projects that you are doing right now, talk about the capacity of their systems now are twice the size of their current bank balance sheet.","Do you have any guidance on what your system will be capable of, not to suggest you are going to do something really big, but can you give us some flavor for how big your system could handle in terms of assets?","Bill Demchak","Yes. That is too broad of a questions to answer specifically, because it obviously depends on the type of activity, but I would tell you historically our challenge was we couldn't scale our activity without scaling the cost along with it, because we had much more manual process than we otherwise wanted.","A big part of what we are building out in technology through automation is the ability to scale without adding variable cost associated with it, so I think we can do material. Once completed we could do material more - volume than we are doing today, importantly without adding the personnel costs that typically comes along with that and that is what we are building into this plan.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Thank you.","Bill Callihan","Net question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Matt Burnell","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. We have heard on a couple of calls the challenges that a lot of the banks are seeing in terms of generating loan growth on the commercial side and I know that you all feel quite comfortable being able to bring more of the fee income component to these relationships, so that you are not just sort of chasing rate, but can you give us an outlook on sort of how you are thinking about commercial loan growth, specifically within the C&I space?","I guess, also sort of where the M&A financing outlook might be to drive further growth in the commercial side of things?","Bill Demchak","Yes. I mean, I guess is a bunch of comments into that space. First of if you look at our growth in C&I relative to peers, at least peers that have reported this quarter and it do not surprise us, we look light and that is coming off of. It is interesting to go back through time, our growth outpaced peers during the crisis in a slowdown as everyone else accelerated, which is typical of our strategy in the sense that the highest returning loans typically are made in times of crisis.","What has happened are a couple of things. One is, a lot of the volume increase you see particularly the large banks is on the back of large corporate M&A activity. We have some of that in our growth rate, but we are more of a middle market bank than a large corporate bank, so we participate less in large corporate growth and some of the big banks.","In the middle market space, specifically, has been really competitive. We have not had outright growth in vanilla middle-market loans I think going back to five or six quarters rather.","Rob Reilly","Easily.","Bill Demchak","\u2026and instead have continued to have and still have growth in our specialty segments of business credit and leasing and real estate and some other things we do. Interestingly, one thing that has impacted the front half of this year, which is somewhat is somewhat new, is some of the loan-only relationships put on you know during the crisis at very wide spreads, a lot of them in the financial. We report them as financial space, but some of them could be securitization-type activity. They have refinanced and re-priced at levels that make no sense to us, particularly in light of the penalties associated with those types of loans under LCR, so we purposely shrunk our FSAB balances while we focused on cross-sell, broader commercial relationships and that is part of the reason you see the slowdown in our growth line.","I think you know that the growth going forward and Rob talked about this, we expect kind of moderate growth in the C&I space and continue to be challenged in the retail space as we continue to see run-off in education loans and some of our legacy books.","Matt Burnell","Then if I can just follow up on credit, Rob, you mentioned the energy exposure, oil and gas exposure is down about 10%.","Rob Reilly","Yes.","Matt Burnell","\u2026and it is still a pretty modest portion of the overall portfolio. I presume given the fairly meaningful decline in NPAs and provision this quarter suggest you did not do much in terms of reserve increases on that portfolio, but could there be a second borrowing base review later in the year that could drive further reserving on that portfolio?","Rob Reilly","Yes. A couple of things there, one is the 10% decline is in our outstanding that I have mentioned as opposed to our exposure and we feel good about the reserve levels I had mentioned, particularly on that roughly $300 million of loans, which is an asset based or investment grade.","We have done some reserving. You will recall in the first quarter, we had mentioned we had done some QFR qualitative research and we have changed some of that around, around some specifics, but no net day change. We will continue to monitor the portfolio closely going forward, but there are not any plans for a big change. We will just continue to watch it as it develops.","Matt Burnell","Thanks very much.","Bill Callihan","Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line John Pancari from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Bill Demchak","Hey, John. Good morning.","John Pancari","I wanted to see if you can give us some additional color on the incremental $100 million in the CIP saves. Just generally where is that coming from? What type of programs? Also, does that have a revenue impact at all from these items?","Then lastly, it does imply that the tail end of the year, the fourth quarter should decline substantially in terms of expenses in order to meet that number 1% down guidance, so just wanted to make sure I understand that correctly and what is driving that?","Rob Reilly","Sure. A couple of things there, one is, generally speaking the additional $100 million is a result of a broad belt-tightening across the organization. We announced it on our first quarter earnings call, our employees all heard and we all rallied around that, so there is not any big number that driving that.","What I would say is, a big portion of that is coming from reducing our planned expenses around staff services which had grown over the last couple of years, which we told you about. Do not really count for a big change in revenue as a result of that, so our revenue guidance stays the same.","Then if you take a look at expenses in terms of sort of the second half of the year around that 1% sort of math. Approximately second expenses need to match our first half expenses, which is what we are saying.","Bill Demchak","The other thing I would mention is, the $100 million of incremental CIP that we focus on this years in fact what we will realize this year, that gives rise to a, you know, entry-level as we get planned for '16. A big part of this exercise is to make sure we are holding expenses down in '16 given that rates you know not only were going to start going up later, but also go up slower. In many ways, this was less about what we were going to do this year and more about what we were going to do in '16 and the out-years.","Rob Reilly","Being positioned to gradually rising rate environment, shallower than what we previously thought.","Rob Reilly","As an example, inside of that 100 branch closures number that we put forth that is inside of our expense rate, right, so there is no one-time. We buried the cost associated with shutting those down and canceling leases and so on and so forth as opposed to announcing a one-time charge associated with closing 100 branches, which other peers have done.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. Then, Bill, getting back to your comments you just made around competition in the mid-market space in C&I, I know you have been talking about that and it certainly sounds like it is still competitive, so my question is, from your perspective, what changes that? I mean, as the size of the pie grows and demand improves across the board here, does that allow you to step back in or are you skeptical of that as well?","Rob Reilly","I do not know exactly what is going to change. What I would tell you is, it is interesting to me that spreads for the first time in I do not know, 10 quarters were basically flat this quarter, so maybe we have hit the bottom at least in this rate environment.","If you go way back in time, you would say that deposit balances in loans inside of banks historically have roughly been equal, with given your loans might grow faster than deposits, but they kind of tend to equal out. We have been in a period of five years, where deposits have massively outgrown loans.","You will hear different people, the dialogue in the industry is as it normalizes to mean revert, is that going to happen by deposits shrinking or by loans growing, so U.S. bank thinks there is going to be a big loan growth spark. I hope they are right.","Morgan and ourselves are probably on the camp that we are probably going to see deposit shrink, but somewhere in there I mean, as we play forward here, status quo, I do not know what is going to change to cause pure middle-market lending-only relationships to be any more attractive, which is why we are focused so much on growing fee income in the cross-sell relationship.","John Pancari","Okay. All right, that is helpful. One last quick thing, did you provide updated purchase accounting accretion expectations for 2015?","Rob Reilly","2016? No. Not yet.","John Pancari","Okay. For full year 2015?","Rob Reilly","For full-year '15, down $200 million that has change from the previous guidance of down $225 million.","John Pancari","Got it. Okay. All right, thank you.","Bill Callihan","Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Paul Miller from FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Paul Miller","Sorry about that. Thank you very much. Can you go back a little bit on the follow-up question on the competition out there? You define yourselves as a middle-market type of bank. Can you define what really middle-market is, because I think it has different definitions for different people.","Bill Demchak","It is a fair question. We probably think about it just in terms of the way we organize ourselves from call it $30 million to $50 million up to $500 million. Practically it is $50 million to $1 billion.","Rob Reilly","In term of annual revenues.","Bill Demchak","Annual revenues, so our sweet spot that kind of fits our product set and then we target is $52 billion in revenues. Having said that, we have a number of clients given our treasury management capability and some of the specialty products we have that are better obviously much, much larger than that.","Paul Miller","Then you have - really, I think if you guys you might not think of it, you have the legacy part of your institution and then the southern part, where you got with RBC. Are you seeing - I mean, that is an area you said that you have going in and really got a lot of credibility and some influx really quickly.","Are you being able to bank that middle-market down there also or is that also just as competitive as you are seeing in your traditional sites?","Rob Reilly","We have actually grown it faster by every measure, you know, into our newer markets. It is just as competitive, but I think you will having an alternative offerings in some of those markets, bringing the other products that we can to bear, particular in the treasury management side makes a difference.","Having a great teams of people, that are combination of terrific people we hired during the downturn and legacy PNC employees that we moved down there, so now in the end we are actually outpacing our more mature markets and in the newer markets.","Bill Demchak","Some of that just is reflective of a smaller base.","Paul Miller","Yes. Then the last question is, what do you think drives out some of that? What do you think that to sum this competition gets driven out? I mean just solid economic growth or what can we look for in the outside to see that you started getting some pricing power in this middle market area?","Rob Reilly","Well, I think you have to be careful to not just focus on loans, so one of the things we look at internally a lot is our loan growth versus our total revenue growth inside the CNIB space. You cannot have a sustainable environment, where you are growing loans of 10% and your revenue at 1%, which if you dig through some income statements you will see a lot of people doing that.","We focus a lot on making sure that we are growing total revenue at a pace that is commensurate with the capital we are deploying, which I think ultimately allows us to provide a good return to our shareholders.","I think people who are chasing loan growth and the thing that ultimately changes, they realize that is not sustainable in terms of providing return on equity to shareholders, I do not know that people have figure that out yet, but lending-only relationships in the middle-market space if that is your business plan without a products set to support it, I do not think is sustainable.","Paul Miller","Okay. Hey, guys, thank you very much.","Bill Callihan","Yup. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ken Usdin","Thanks, good morning guys.","Bill Callihan","Hey, Ken.","Ken Usdin","Hey, Rob, I appreciate the color on the second half expenses and I was just wondering, can you just help us understand that mechanism in terms of the tax change, so the $54 million that was in the second quarter, was that a catch up? Was it a one-time? Then just in terms of how that goes forward?","Bill Demchak","He is so happy that you asked that question.","Rob Reilly","Yes. I am glad you asked that question Ken, because the $54 million really reflects the total first half of '15 activity. It is a lumpy business, so virtually all of our sort of tax credit business in the first half of the year, we did in the second quarter.","The best number that I can give you for the full year number is $80 million, which is our budgeted number that we budgeted at the beginning of the year. Again, it is a lumpy business, so we could do a little bit more than that, we could do a little bit less than that, but that is not a number that you would annualize.","For some context, total tax credits in 2014 were $75 million, so that fits in with that $80 million.","Ken Usdin","Okay. That is helpful, so it is\u2026","Rob Reilly","Also, Ken, just on that. That is the $80 million is what we used for the math to give you the guidance on the effective tax rate at 26%, so that is why you say\u2026","Ken Usdin","Yes. Right. I was going to say that, that was implied in the $26 million for the year is, that it would not run at this $54 million?","Rob Reilly","Yes.","Ken Usdin","\u2026so you are just trying to give us a best understanding of kind of a generic, what seems to be kind of volatile, but business you do on a recurring basis.","Rob Reilly","That is right.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Got it. Then just a second question on investment securities, so you guys are in good shape on LCR and we see that you have been building, when I look at the core interest, net interest margin, obviously, there is still the negative rollover effect 11 basis points on the investment securities. How are new investments coming on versus what is on the balance sheet and are we getting closer to kind of that stabilization with the rates up a little bit?","Rob Reilly","Yes. We are. In terms of securities on, securities off, they are getting very close, so that in the end will start to lose that bleed as long as the long end stays about where it is. Part of what you are seeing though of course is just the building cash, right, so\u2026","Ken Usdin","Yes.","Rob Reilly","\u2026so the drop in NIM simply is a function of the building cash which is sitting 125 basis points at the fed.","Ken Usdin","Right, but your point, your front book\/back book is getting better?","Rob Reilly","Yes.","Ken Usdin","\u2026or closer?","Bill Callihan","Yes.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Thanks, Bill.","Bill Callihan","Okay. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache from Nomura. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Good morning. Can you guys discuss the quality of the money market and demand deposit growth that you saw this quarter from an LCR perspective? On a related note, on the initiatives that some banks have undertaken to deemphasize non-operating deposits, do you have any thoughts on where those deposits are going?","Bill Demchak","Well, on the money markets side it shows up on the retail segment, they are all LCR-friendly\u2026","Rob Reilly"," All good.","Bill Demchak","\u2026all good and we have been pleasantly surprised and tracking aggressively, obviously, the retention of new money, new clients. Interestingly, the balances for new households are higher given our product offerings than they have been in our history partly changing our checking account mix. ","As it relates to operating deposits for corporate, they are less valuable to us from an LCR standpoint. They are still valuable and we still obviously have room on our leverage ratio and the ability to hold those, so inside of our corporate space it would not surprised me at all that we are getting some growth in corporate balances that is coming as a function or some of the that are constrained pushing those away.","Bill Carcache","That is very helpful. On a separate note, relating to fee income, some folks that we have spoken with have expressed a little bit of skepticism surrounding the sustainability of your fee income growth. Bill, could you discuss what is underlying your confidence and your ability to sustain the kind of growth trajectory that you guys are experiencing as we look forward from here?","Bill Demchak","In its simplest form, we are simply suggesting we are going to continue to do what we have done for the last.","Rob Reilly","\u2026maintaining trajectory.","Bill Demchak","\u2026a couple of years, and each one of those line items kind of drills down to a specific business plan that does not assume heroic assumptions to be able to accomplish it.","On the corporate side, the growth you are seeing and we have talked about is coming on the back of cross-selling all the new clients that we on boarded during the crisis. We had 10% compounded primary client growth and CNIB for two or three years running during the crisis that we are largely lending-only relationships. We now have the ability to monetize that through cross-sell.","In the retail side, it is on the back of the continuum change of what we did with the product offerings, elimination of free checking, the continued growth in merchant, debit and credit card where we are underpenetrated and well fits what we have not done for five years and using the rest of the organization to refer business and cross-sell.","There is nothing heroic in there. We are hitting on all lines of business against this general notion that we put forth as a company that we want to be less dependent long-term on net interest income to drive this company and be able to get back to a more historical balance that we used to run at in terms of fees and net interest income, so we are just prioritizing. People get it is important.","Bill Carcache","That is great. Thank you. That really helps a lot. If I can squeeze one last one in relating to just a follow-up on your comments surrounding the deployment of your excess liquidity, one of your peers indicated yesterday that the 10-year U.S. treasuries at around 2.5% represented an attractive asset in the rate environment that we find ourselves in and they were comfortable extending duration a little bit.","You mentioned, Bill, that your securities balances should start to rise from here as you stepped your way into a higher rate environment, does that mean that you are also feeling a little bit more comfortable extending duration now than you did say a quarter or two ago?","Bill Demchak","We like to 10-year a lot better to 240 than we did at 179 or wherever it hit towards the end of the first quarter.","I think and I listened to that conversation you are talking about. Look, I think at the end the long ends going to have a slow grind higher. We have deployed, as you saw this quarter, a little more cash into the securities book. We are never going to make a single big bet that is not who we are. We are going to increment our way in as rates change here and we have a large opportunity to do that relative to the way we are invested today.","One of the things that I should have mentioned, we talked about loan growth as our residential mortgage holdings on the whole loan side, which are obviously also form of a fixed rate duration.","While we keep kind of jumbos in some of the production from our mortgage company it is a lot smaller percentage and an opportunity for us, but it is a lot smaller percentage today than many of our peers, so we have a lot of ways to play here.","I think by and large, nobody is expecting a massive sell-off in a long and there is more value here today than it was a quarter ago. Even on the mortgage side, somebody of the adds we did we are actually in mortgage-backed securities that OAS spreads on mortgage-backs are much, much wider than they were three months ago, so there is an opportunity there.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Very helpful.","Bill Callihan","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Marty Mosby","Thank you. Rob, I wanted to go back to the deposit beta discussion. The characterization of JPMorgan is a little bit skewed in the sense that [ph] did come back yesterday and said, look, if there is gamma, which means early on the deposit betas are going to be much different than let us say after the first 50 basis points to 100 basis points.","I just want it to kind of re-context that for you and ask more specifically, what happens initially versus maybe what happens generally over the whole rate increase, so think about the first 50 basis points first.","Rob Reilly","Bill wants to jump in here a little bit too. Marty, you and I have spoken about this a little bit. First and foremost, nobody knows, so we will see. What we spent a lot of time on is, just being and planning for all sorts of outcomes recognizing that it has been a long time since we have had a interest rate increase and that consumer behavior could be substantially different here 11 years later, particularly around the LCR, the attractiveness of deposits on LCR over and above the margin.","Then of course the increased technology that which allows us consumers to low deposits from bank-to-bank a lot more easily than they could have 11 years ago, so I do not have any answer for you, but I do know that we plan around it obsessively. That is a priority of Bill's and we just have to be ready to go with however the scenario plays out.","Bill Demchak","I think missing from some of that analysis is, I mean, we go up look today that where teaser rates are, new deposit money markets, right? They were well over. There are offers out there for a percent\u2026","Rob Reilly","\u2026or higher.","Bill Demchak","Yes, so they are well over where rates are today, meaning that the betas three x already. The question is as rates rise or are those teasers going to go straight up on top of that out of the gate, probably not.","The other thing that will lag is interest-bearing business accounts and so forth or probably lag somewhat, but I think the core consumer interest-bearing accounts given the demand for LCR friendly deposits, they are going to move pretty fast.","Rob Reilly","We have got to be ready for that.","Marty Mosby","Well, let me ask you another way. Can you condition the way you will posture yourself? In other words, we get a 25-basis point move in the fed funds rate, will you be proactively moving your rates higher or will you react to what the market change is? If you do not see any outflow of deposits, will you then\u2026","Rob Reilly","No. Look we and the rest of the market are going to feel our way around to figure out what is going to move balances or not for the first movements, so it is not as if we instantaneously change all of our prices if that is what your question is.","I just think we have proven ourselves, because we have had leading offers in the market to grow deposits to complete our LCR process that money lose with was slightly higher offers and not everybody in the market is LCR compliant, if in fact deposit shrink in the system because QE goes away and\/or loans grow then...","Marty Mosby","Understood. Hello?","Operator","Please go ahead sir.","Marty Mosby","Lastly, Rob, I just want to ask you on the shortening of the duration in the portfolio. The yields on the securities portfolio have been moving down pretty significantly. I just did not know if you had also, in addition to adding cash over the last year have you also been maybe shying towards a little bit shorter duration on your purchases of the portfolio, and are you kind of through maybe that process?","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thank you very much.","Bill Demchak","Technology issue.","Rob Reilly","We will answer Marty's question.","Bill Callihan","Well, hang on. Is Eric on the online?","Eric Wasserstrom","I am. Yes.","Rob Reilly","Okay.","Eric Wasserstrom","Is Marty\u2026? ","Bill Demchak","Eric, why do not you go ahead?","Eric Wasserstrom","Yes. Sorry. I think some of us got briefly disconnected.","Bill Demchak","Yes.","Eric Wasserstrom","Just to follow up on two issues very quickly as we wrap up the call here. One, Rob, I just wanted to make sure I understood your commentary about loan growth across the newer geographies.","It seems like sort of the run rate for the industry is somewhere in the sort of 6% to 8% annualized level, but did I understand your commentary to mean that it is in line with that off of a low base, because intuitively it seemed like it should be somewhat greater than the industry average just given the starting point.","Bill Demchak","This is Bill and I think I was the one who was talking about that. I actually I do not know the percentages down there, but they are going to be higher there.","Rob Reilly","Yes.","Bill Callihan","Materially, a little bit higher.","Rob Reilly","It depends on what period you are looking from the start of materially higher, still higher but not by as much as we mature, right?","Bill Demchak","Yes.","Eric Wasserstrom","Okay, great. Thanks. Then my second question is, Rob, in the context of your commentary that as rate expectations changed, you had to make some changes to your expense outlook, but you may be at this point in the minority of thinking that the next fed hike is coming in September.","If in fact that gets pushed out by a quarter or two, would that necessitate another change or did the change you make anticipate potential additional slippage?","Rob Reilly","It is a good question. The change that we made was the reaction in April, when we pushed back those rates. If rates do not rise in '15, in that September hike, that is really not necessary expense related. We have bracketed that around in terms of NII. It is not a huge number. The bigger issue as Bill pointed out, relative to '16 and beyond in terms of the gradual rate rise. That is a much, much bigger impact to our revenue.","Eric Wasserstrom","Great. Thanks very much.","Bill Demchak","Okay. With that we have passed the time, so we are going to wrap up the call. Thank you all for joining us and have a good day.","A - Rob Reilly","Thank you.","A - Bill Demchak","Thanks.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded today, Wednesday, October 16, 2013. I would now like to turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bill Callihan. Please go ahead, sir.","William H. Callihan","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call for The PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call is PNC's President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Our forward-looking statements regarding PNC's performance assume a continuation of the current economic environment and do not take into account the impact of potential legal and regulatory or federal debt ceiling contingencies. Actual results and future events could differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in our statements and from historical performance due to a variety of factors and risks. Information about such factors, as well as GAAP reconciliation and other information on non-GAAP financial measures we discuss is included in today's conference call, earnings release, related presentation materials and our 10-K, 10-Qs and various other SEC filings and investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under the Investor Relations section. These statements speak only as of October 16, 2013, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Demchak.","William S. Demchak","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everybody. I'm going to run through some of the highlights from the third quarter and talk about the progress we're making on our strategic priorities.","As you've seen already today, we reported net income of $1 billion or $1.79 per diluted common share with a return on average assets of 1.36%. You'd also seen that we had a few select items that impacted earnings, including a pretax gain of $85 million or $0.10 per diluted share on the sale of some Visa Class B common stock, similar to the gain that we had on Visa sales in the second quarter. In addition, the provision was lower than expected, primarily due to overall improved credit quality.","We also exceeded our own expectations regarding expense management. As you'll recall, we expected expenses to be up modestly in the quarter, but in fact, expenses declined by $11 million. And we achieved our $700 million annual continuous improvement goal in the quarter.","We also continue to build on our strong capital position. Our estimated Basel I Tier 1 common capital ratio increased to 10.4%, and our pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common capital ratio reached an estimated 8.6% in the third quarter. This stronger capital position should position us well in terms of returning capital to our shareholders in 2014, subject, of course, to the CCAR process.","And during a time when the Fed data tells us loan demand has slowed across the industry, PNC continued to grow loans in the third quarter. Importantly, we did this within our risk parameters by winning new clients, and we delivered solid fee income by deepening relationships with our existing customers.","Year-over-year, commercial and consumer lending combined are up almost $11 billion or about 6%. Now looking across the business, we continue to make important progress against our long-term strategic priorities. We're seeing very promising activity in the Southeast, outpacing our expectations. We have 51 new primary corporate banking clients in the Southeast this quarter versus 44 last quarter. And client and loan growth in the Southeast are significantly outpacing our legacy markets on a percentage basis.","Now that being said, the incremental opportunity in the Southeast is significant, as these markets are running at less than half the median productivity of our legacy markets. And across the company, especially in C&IB, we're seeing many relationships that began with lending grow deeper as the average number of products those clients are buying ticks up each year.","Now noninterest income in our Asset Management Group is up by $18 million or 11% year-over-year due to increases in the equity markets and strong sales production resulting in net positive flows. The growth was driven by an increase in new primary client acquisitions of more than 35% in the first 9 months compared to a year ago.","Now for the Residential Mortgage Banking business, refinanced volumes and gain on sale margins continue to decline as we suggested they would last quarter. Our total origination volume was down 21% in the quarter as growth and purchase volume was not enough to offset the declines on the refinance side of the business.","In response, we took steps to better align our expenses with decline in revenue, and Rob is going to talk a bit more about that in a few minutes. We continue the work we've discussed in the past to dramatically improve the home-buying process for our customers and to get them from application to closing more efficiently than our peers. Customer loyalty continues to grow stronger as a result.","In Retail, we closed or consolidated another 62 branches in the quarter, and we remain on pace to close or consolidate about 200 by year end. Still, net checking account relationships increased by 69,000, and we grew consumer loans by $1.1 billion on a spot basis in the quarter.","Additionally, we experienced record-high migration of deposit transactions, up 70% year-over-year, as evolving customer preferences continue to drive our transformation of the Retail Banking business.","Now Rob is going to review the quarterly results in a second, but I wanted to step back just for a moment to look at where we are at the end of the third quarter this year versus the same time in 2012. As we look year-to-date, net income is $3.2 billion, which is an increase of 39% from the $2.3 billion through the third quarter of 2012. Our return on average assets through the first 3 quarters of 2013 was 1.4%, and noninterest income increased by 20% compared to the same period last year. Noninterest income as a percentage of total revenue was 42% year-to-date. That's up from 37% year-to-date through the first 9 months of 2012, and that's really in keeping with our intended strategic direction.","Now we had a better-than-expected third quarter in spite of all the environmental challenges that the industry has been confronting, as well as the uncertainty created by the federal government shutdown and the threat of a potential U.S. default. Now, in my view, the shutdown here is unlikely to cause any permanent economic or financial markets damage, assuming that it doesn't continue for any extended period of time. On the other hand, a U.S. default, while still unlikely, would have a much worse outcome for the economy. Even if Congress increases the debt ceiling in a timely manner at this point, we're still likely to see an impact in the form of a slowdown in broader economic activity as we go into the fourth quarter. So things aren't going to get any easier, and we have plenty of work to do yet to fully capitalize on the opportunities that are in front of us. But our results clearly indicate that our strategy is working as designed and that we're better positioned to create long-term shareholder value because of that.","With that, let me turn it over to Rob to take you through the numbers.","Robert Q. Reilly","Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with our balance sheet on Slide 4. Loan growth and solid operating performance resulted in higher retained earnings in the third quarter, which led to strengthened capital. Our total assets increased by $4 billion or 1% on a linked quarter basis as we saw growth in both consumer and commercial lending.","Total commercial lending increased by $1.2 billion compared to the second quarter of 2013, predominantly in commercial real estate and to a considerably lesser extent, our other specialty lending businesses. Consumer lending saw an increase of approximately $1.9 billion on a linked quarter basis, primarily due to accelerated growth in automobile lending across our footprint. We also saw increases from growth in our home equity and credit card portfolios.","And in addition, we purchased approximately $900 million of jumbo mortgage loans in the quarter. This growth was partially offset by paydowns in education loans.","Total deposits increased by $3.8 billion or almost 2% in the third quarter as growth in commercial deposits offset seasonal declines in consumer deposits and further CD runoff. Shareholders' equity increased by $844 million or more than 2% in the third quarter as a result of growth in retained earnings, and this drove our capital ratios higher.","Our Basel I Tier 1 common ratio at the end of the third quarter is estimated to be 10.4%. That's up 30 basis points since the end of the second quarter. And our Basel Tier 1 pro forma common capital ratio was estimated to be 8.6% as of September 30, without the benefit of phase-ins, a 40-basis-point increase from June 30, primarily due to retained earnings. This Basel III estimate is based on our current understanding of the final Basel III rules.","As you'll recall, we said our operating range for the Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was between 8% and 8.5% without the benefit of phase-ins. Our target was to achieve that by year end 2013. Through our strong year-to-date performance, we've obviously exceeded the upper end of that range. Importantly, we continue to believe we will be well positioned to return additional capital to shareholders in 2014.","Our income statement for the third quarter reflects strong overall performance. And as you can see on Slide 5, net income was up $1 billion or $1.79 per diluted common share, and our return on average assets was 1.36%. These results reflect ongoing loan balance and fee income growth, along with disciplined expense management. As Bill mentioned, this quarter's results also benefited from a gain on the sale of additional Visa stock and lower-than-expected provision for credit losses.","Let me highlight a few items in our income statement. Net interest income declined by $24 million, which was aligned with our expectations, primarily due to lower core net interest income and lower purchase accounting accretion. While fee income was strong overall in the third quarter, total noninterest income was down by $120 million or 7% on a linked quarter basis, primarily due to higher gains on asset sales and valuations we experienced in the second quarter. I'll say more about that in a moment.","As a result, total revenue for the third quarter was $3.9 billion. Third quarter expenses of $2.4 billion declined $11 million on a linked quarter basis, reflecting our focus on expense management. As a result, our pretax pre-provision earnings were $1.5 billion, down 8% compared to the second quarter, but an increase of 4% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Provision in the third quarter was $137 million, lower than the guidance we provided due to better-than-expected improvements in credit quality. Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail.","Turning to net interest income. As you can see on Slide 6, total net interest income declined by $24 million on a linked quarter basis as loan growth largely but not entirely offset the further spread compression we saw this quarter. As expected, net interest margin decreased to 3.47% in the third quarter, primarily reflecting these lower spreads.","In our investment securities portfolio, you'll recall that we put additional money to work late in the second quarter following a substantial movement in interest rates. Those actions resulted in a slight increase in interest income in the third quarter.","Having said that, we're not taking on additional interest rate risk as we've maintained a negative duration of equity of approximately 2 years. Importantly, our balance sheet remains asset-sensitive and positioned for a rising interest rate environment.","Total purchase accounting accretion declined due to lower scheduled accretion, which was partially offset by higher-than-expected cash recoveries on purchased impaired loans. Over time, you should expect a lower level of cash recoveries as the amount of our purchased impaired loans continues to decline.","Regarding our outlook for purchase accounting accretion in the fourth quarter, we are now expecting purchase accounting to be approximately $175 million. For the full year 2013, this equates to a decline of approximately $300 million versus 2012, and that's due to the elevated cash recovery. As a result, we now expect purchase accounting to be down approximately $300 million in 2014 compared to 2013.","Bill talked about the progress we're making with our strategic priorities, and you can see that in the third quarter results for our fee income categories as shown on Slide 7. Our Asset Management Group had another good quarter with strong net positive flows and growth in asset -- I'm sorry, growth in sales and primary customers. As you know, the asset management fee category reflects the combination of fees generated by our asset managed business, along with earnings attributable to our interest in BlackRock.","Consumer service fees were up $2 million or 1% compared to the second quarter, primarily as a result of higher debit card and credit card fees. Corporate services saw increased merger and acquisition advisory fees in the third quarter, offset somewhat by reduced client activity.","The valuation gains on commercial mortgage servicing rights that we discussed with you last quarter were lower in the third quarter. And as a result, corporate service fees declined $20 million on a linked quarter basis.","Residential Mortgage was up $32 million or 19% linked quarter, and 3 factors drove these results: First, our provision for repurchase obligations was a $6 million benefit in the third quarter versus a $73 million provision in the second quarter as the third quarter benefit reflects a small reserve release; second, we did see a decline in loan sales revenue reflecting lower origination volumes and declining gain on sale margins. As you know, higher interest rates affected third quarter originations, which were $3.7 billion, down $1 billion or 21% as a result of lower refinancing activity.","Of strategic importance to us, the decline in refinancing was partially offset by home purchase transaction volume, which was up 5% on a linked quarter basis and now represents 38% of originations, up from 28% in the second quarter. At the same time, the gain on sale margin fell to 292 basis points.","And third, our net hedging gains on servicing rights were $57 million in the third quarter, an increase of $31 million on a linked quarter basis. I'll say more about the Residential Mortgage expense reductions we have taken in a moment.","Finally on this slide, deposit service charges increased by $9 million or 6% linked quarter from increased customer activity across nearly all geographies. Moving beyond the fee categories, net gains on sales of securities less net OTTI decreased in the third quarter, consistent with the levels we saw in the same quarter last year.","Other noninterest income was impacted by the sale of 2 million of our Visa Class B common shares in the third quarter resulting in a pretax gain of $85 million, consistent with the prior quarter. We continue to hold 10.4 million shares of Visa Class B common stock with an estimated fair value of approximately $833 million as of quarter end. These shares are recorded on our books at approximately $158 million, resulting in an unrecognized value of approximately $675 million pretax.","Excluding the impact of the Visa sale, other noninterest income declined by $97 million or 26%. On a linked quarter basis, the primary decline was in the lower credit valuations, and that relates to customer-initiated hedging activity, which accounted for approximately $40 million. The remainder was accumulations of small gains and recoveries on asset dispositions that we experienced in the second quarter.","Our diversified businesses resulted in noninterest income to total revenue of 43% in the third quarter. Given the progress we're making on our strategic priorities, we expect this percentage to grow over time.","We continue to expect that full year total reported revenue will increase in 2013 compared to 2012. Expenses continue to be well managed in the third quarter.","Turning to Slide 8. Total expenses decreased by $11 million on a linked quarter basis. As you'll recall, our 2013 goal is to achieve a total of $700 million in continuous improvement cost savings this year. As of September 30, we have already reached and now continue to work on surpassing that goal.","As a result of these efforts, we now expect full year 2013 expenses on a reported basis to be below 2012 by more than 5%. We recognize that controlling expenses will continue to be critical to success in this low interest rate environment. To that end, we have already started the process of identifying continuous improvement opportunities for 2014.","As a further note, we concluded our redemptions of the remaining discounted trust preferred securities in the third quarter with a noncash charge of $27 million. In total, we now -- we have now redeemed some $3.2 billion in these higher rate securities, resulting in noncash charges totaling approximately $550 million since the fourth quarter of 2011.","In regard to our Residential Mortgage business, earlier this month, we took actions to reduce operating expenses that included eliminating approximately 7% of the workforce. This will result in annual savings of approximately $24 million, which we'll begin to see in the fourth quarter with the full realization of these savings occurring in the first quarter of 2014.","As you can see on Slide 9, overall credit quality continued to improve in the third quarter. Criticized commercial loans, non-performing loans and overall delinquencies all decreased on a linked quarter basis.","Non-performing loans were down $115 million or 3% compared to the second quarter as we saw broad-based improvement in both our consumer and commercial loan portfolios. Overall delinquencies were lower by $128 million or 5% on a linked quarter basis, driven by lower 90-day past due consumer loans.","Net charge-offs increased nominally by $16 million on a linked quarter basis as recoveries were lower than previous quarters. However, as we said in the second quarter, we still believe this low level of charge-offs is not sustainable.","Finally, our provision of $137 million declined by 13% on a linked quarter basis, driven by this improved overall credit quality.","In summary, PNC posted strong financial results in the third quarter. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect our results to be consistent with our previous quarterly guidance and performance. Of course, our outlook assumes a sensible resolution to the federal government shutdown and the debt-ceiling situation.","We expect modest growth in loans and continued growth in fee income, reflecting our focus on our strategic priorities. We also expect net interest income to be down modestly, reflecting the continued decline in purchase accounting accretion. And we expect noninterest expense to be stable when compared to the third quarter.","Over the last few quarters, our provision and our guidance on provision have been coming down. While the performance of our corporate and consumer loan portfolios has been favorable, consumers, for example, are still facing a number of headwinds as a result of the sluggish economy. This causes us to believe that this reduced level of provisioning may not be sustainable. As a result, for the fourth quarter, we expect the provision for credit losses to be between $150 million and $225 million.","And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question from the line of Erika Najarian, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, my first question is on how we should think about the efficiency for next year and making sure that we're understanding the puts and takes that you mentioned on the call. On the one hand, Bill, you mentioned the opportunity to continue to increase productivity in the Southeast, clearly positive for that efficiency ratio. On the other hand, you also mentioned a $300 million decline on the accretable yield, but you also mentioned that you're looking for more savings post achieving your continuous improvement process savings. I guess, given all those puts and takes, should we expect the efficiency ratio to continue to grind down in 2014 from the 62% that you mentioned -- or that you posted this quarter?","William S. Demchak","Look, it's too early to tell you or give you guidance on what we think is going to happen in '14 exactly, but I think we, as well as the rest of the industry, face this fight against top line revenue as we're in a tougher environment. We do have organic growth opportunities. We highlight the Southeast. We highlight cross-sell and fee income categories. What I would tell you longer term as it relates to our efficiency ratios, the near-term success we've had in controlling expenses and in fact, lowering expenses was kind of the easy stuff. We have a longer-term opportunity that we're focused on now on process reengineering that relates to basically cleaning up the sequence of integrations that we've done over the last bunch of years. And this will bear fruit over the next few years, not necessarily visible in '14. But it is the thing that ultimately would allow us to substantially improve our efficiency ratio, at least that's what our goal would be relative to our peers. But that's not a near term -- we'll be working on it near term, but you're not going to see those results show up immediately.","Robert Q. Reilly","Erika, if I can just add to that. This is Rob. We're in the middle of our budgeting process for 2014. And as been our custom as far as guidance for '14, we'll cover that in our January call as we've done in past years.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just my follow-up question is on the Basel III Tier 1 common disclosure. Rob, is that under the advanced method or standardized method?","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes, it's currently under the advanced method.","Operator","Our next question from John McDonald from Sanford Bernstein.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Rob, was wanting to just clarify on the noninterest income outlook, the purchase accounting, you said down 170 or so in the fourth quarter and 300 next year?","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes, I'm sorry. To clarify that, it will be 175 in the fourth quarter. If you recall, we had given guidance where purchase accounting would be down approximately $600 million over the 2-year period 2013 and 2014. In 2013, we've experienced more recoveries, about $50 million more than we expected. So that's now down $300 million. And then for '14, which was previously $250 million, is down $300 million. So it's still the same $600 million, just the timing of those recoveries has changed a bit.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And that combines both the scheduled accretion and your outlook for cash recoveries?","Robert Q. Reilly","It does, yes.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Together? Okay. And what's your outlook for kind of the core NII? In a flat rate environment, what would you expect from core NII, and what are the puts and takes there on your outlook for core?","Robert Q. Reilly","The -- well, again, we'll save our '14 guidance for the January conference call. But I think it's in terms of the guidance that we talked about, down a bit, largely reflective of the purchase accounting decline, less so on the core side. But downward pressure for sure.","William S. Demchak","Just thinking about what's happening here, we continue to grow loans. We'd expect to be able to still do that, but we're growing loans at tighter spreads as spreads continue to contract. While rates are higher, we've been pretty clear that even while we reinvest roll-off of securities, which as an aside, we weren't doing for part of the year. But even as we do that now, we're typically reinvesting at a lower book yield on new securities than what's rolling off. So we have that pressure unless we choose to increase balances in today's rate environment, which we just otherwise have chosen not to do. We want to kind of maintain that dry powder with the asset sensitivity. So it's -- it'll be a fight to keep core flat.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And, Bill, just a bigger-picture question, you're clearly indicating you'd like to do more capital return next year. But it also sounds like you're happy with the opportunities that the RBC platform has given you in the Southeast. So just kind of wondering how you will balance over time the return of capital versus kind of adding new platforms like you did with RBC through acquisitions.","William S. Demchak","We've been pretty clear about our strategic priorities. I'll reiterate them for you. We think our organic growth opportunity here is substantial. I also think that given what we're seeing in terms of just changes in the Retail Banking model for the industry, it's not obvious that adding sort of yesterday's Retail Banking model is what would necessarily allow us to succeed in the Southeast. In some ways, building the model for the future down there is actually an advantage for us, and that's what we're going to focus on.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Paul Miller with FBR.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Yes. Going back a little bit on the net interest margin, how much of that decline was driven by your cash balances? I noticed your -- some of your cash balances really increased over the quarter.","Robert Q. Reilly","A couple. Yes, they came relatively late in the quarter there, Paul. So it would be a couple of basis points.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","It would be a couple of basis points?","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And then talking about this -- the performance down in the Southeast, can you add some more color around that? Exactly -- are you opening up new branches? What type of wallet penetration are you getting down there? I know so far, there's -- that acquisition has been doing very well for you.","William S. Demchak","Well, it's -- I mean, a bunch of different businesses, right? So in wealth management, RBC didn't have a single employee focused on the space. We have full teams down there. So we're growing by vast percentages off of a base of 0. In C&IB, we've been really surprised by the pace of loan growth and client wins. Part of that is we have the right people in the seats down there. I think part of it is simply that we're new players in markets where there's clients down there that just aren't satisfied with the existing providers. So some of it's low hanging fruit, I'm sure. On the retail side, which is kind of the question everybody gets to on we don't have retail penetration at least as it relates to what you would want to have on historical standards for retail. We're pursuing a path in retail across our footprint of -- think of hub branches or universal branches with sort of a digitally thin or digitally enabled branches surrounding them. Think of new branches as half the space and half the cost as you roll forward versus a traditional branch network that in the past would have cost more to build and more to maintain and run. And we're building that out, trying new things down in the newer markets, some with successes, some with failures, but we're learning from it. We're applying the successes to all of our markets.","Robert Q. Reilly","18 months in.","William S. Demchak","Yes.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","What was that last comment, 18?","Robert Q. Reilly","Just 18 months since start.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And if I just back up real quick, last question. You said you're getting good penetration to C&I. I mean, is it -- how much of this is in the overall book, like, in other words, how much of that stuff is coming in relative on a percentage basis of your growth in loans on your overall?","William S. Demchak","It's vastly outpacing our legacy markets. I don't know if any of you guys...","Robert Q. Reilly","In terms of loan growth. In percentages, it's about 2x.","William S. Demchak","Yes. It's starting to -- I mean, it is starting to make a difference in terms of the growth rate for the whole company. Somewhere we have that number, I'm sure Callihan could dig that up after the call or something.","William H. Callihan","Yes, we'll get back to you, Paul.","William S. Demchak","Yes.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So a couple of follow-ups on the expense side. When you say flat expenses in 4Q versus 3Q, is that off of the 2 3 7 6 adjusted number or the reported 2 4 2 4?","Robert Q. Reilly","So we said that's stable, and it's off the 2 4 2 4 number.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And do you, expect, there's obviously the truck [ph] charges this quarter and then some other expenses that you've applied to your totaling about -- between the two of them about $50 million. Are there some other lumpy items you expect in 4Q or...?","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes, typically -- that's a good question, Matt -- I mean typically, we see a rise in our fourth quarter expenses around some seasonal items, notably incentive compensation, et cetera. Where we've changed that to stable is we do think the expense control program that we've put in place is largely going to be able to offset that in the fourth quarter. So we don't see anything necessarily lumpy, but we do see what's typically a seasonally high quarter coming in stable.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And I realize you'll provide more guidance in a few months, but as we start thinking about kind of run rate levels of costs heading into next year, I mean, it seems like we should be focused more on the 2 3 7 6 and then factor in whatever revenue and different efforts that you have.","William S. Demchak","Well, look, we'd like to be focused on that too, but give us till the January call to give you some guidance on that.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just separately, I realize this is a little nuanced, but the payoffs within the nonperformers came up quite a bit, and was just wondering -- or sorry, the return of nonperformers to performing status was a much bigger number and obviously, it's good, credit's getting better. Just wondering if there's anything lumpy in there or...","Robert Q. Reilly","No, I think there's some categorical shifts. But generally speaking, we're still running at that $3.6 billion so in total, which is fairly flat. And they're non-performing.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly...","William H. Callihan","What line number are you picking up?","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's just the return to performing status of $354 million. It's a pretty big number.","William S. Demchak","Part of that's TDRs.","William H. Callihan","Yes, primarily, Matt, there's some of the TDRs that have now come back to performing after 6 months in the program.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly if I could squeeze in just the tax rate, it's -- I guess it's been consistently lower than expected. Do I -- how do we think about that going forward, not necessarily for 4Q but just out a year or 2?","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes. As you know, our guidance around tax rate is at 25%. We came in below that in this quarter. That was a result of some minor true-ups of our deferred tax accounts. Again, we'll give you a 2014 information in a couple of months. But for the balance of the year, we're still at that 25% number.","Operator","Next question from the line of Keith Murray from Nomura.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Actually, ISI now. Just wanted to touch on loan growth. It came in, I think, better than expectations this quarter. I know on the last quarterly call, you were talking about walking away from some deals where you didn't like the terms and the structures. Have you seen any improvement there or has it stabilized at least, and where are you guys taking some market share?","William S. Demchak","It's -- no. It's a tough market particularly in sort of traditional C&I. If anything, it's gotten worse from our comments in the second quarter. But the growth we had at least on the commercial space, and I'll let Rob speak to retail in a second, but the growth we've had on the commercial space, the majority of it in real estate, a lot of that on the back of just continuing fund up on projects done in past periods of time, as well as we continue to take advantage of some term financing on CMBS rollover, small growth in asset-based lending and some of the other specialty segments. But it's really tough in just generic C&I revolver space to the point where we're starting to see spread returns pushing back to 2005 where we saw before a lot of competition. We haven't, as I mentioned in my comments, just on the risk side, we walk away when we have to walk away. We defend clients aggressively when we have a lot of cross-sell, and we'll give on price when necessary. We won't give on structure.","Robert Q. Reilly","And then just on the retail side -- or the consumer side rather, it's been largely a result of our growth in our automobile portfolio, some nominal minor growth on the home equity side on the term loans. And then as I mentioned in my comments, we did purchase some jumbo loans during the quarter.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And then switching to the fee side, you focused on growing asset management and wealth management, are you seeing any opportunities there for lift outs of teams?","William S. Demchak","We hired, in effect, I don't know if it's necessarily teams, but we hired all new people down in the Southeast. We transferred some people down. But we, in some ways, have become an employer of choice in the business. We've been growing aggressively. I don't know, Rob, what's the number over the last couple of years of people [indiscernible]","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes, 300 plus annually.","William S. Demchak","Yes. Generically, either buying a team or buying small firms become problematic in terms of their integration into our model, so we try to hire employees as opposed to think about teams or businesses.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","If you don't mind, I'll just add one more. You talked about changing the Retail Banking model. You think about the ROE of that business today versus 5 or 6 years ago, if you put, obviously, the rate piece of it aside, how big of a difference is it down 20%, 30%, do you think?","William S. Demchak","I don't know that I've ever calculated it that way because we have a combination of the regulatory changes on the fee side, higher costs. You have the rate impact and importantly, you just have the changing preference of consumers and the use of technology. It is very clear, and I've been pretty public in my remarks that the business model for retail needs to change as we embrace both the new regulatory environment, but importantly, consumer preferences and their desire to interface with us through multiple channels both physical and digital. So I don't -- what it is today versus in the past, it's down a lot. I think there's opportunity, a lot of opportunity for that to improve, but it's going to come through a transformation of that business in my view as opposed to pulling individual costs out or hoping that interest rates go back up.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies and Co.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Hey, just one last cleanup on the guidance. You talked, on the fee side, you talked about the core lines all growing in the fourth but that other component is a big one. I know you guys have given some color on that in the past, and you mentioned that there was kind of a $40 million hit on it this quarter. How do we think about that other piece?","Robert Q. Reilly","Well, I would say again, so the guidance is on that core piece. The other piece, which has been, as you said we've experienced big numbers there related to rate movements primarily in the one that you referenced as well as some asset sales, it's hard to give a lot of guidance on because it reflects whatever happens in the environment in that particular given quarter.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. All right. Secondly, just with regards to asset yields in core and the core NIM, it was down again a decent amount. And I've heard some of your -- heard your prior comments about not necessarily taking on more interest rate risk, but x purchase accounting accretion, what are you seeing in terms of new loan yields relative to what's on the books? And can you give us a little bit of color just like what's rotating through the securities portfolio?","William S. Demchak","You want to hit the loans, and I'll...","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes, sure, sure. So I'll, again I'll handle the loans and Bill will talk about the securities. On the loan side, as Bill mentioned to the earlier question, it's tough on the corporate side, the spreads that we're seeing in terms of the deals that we choose to do within our risk parameters are lower than what we have on our existing books. So that's going to put downward pressure on the NIM. We can grow the NII depending on what kind of volume shows. And on the consumer side, there is similar spread pressure. So I think as far as from the loan perspective, the downward pressure on the NIM is our outlook.","William S. Demchak","But we have -- I mean, I think if you look back in time, we've had 5, 6, 7 basis points of C&I spread decline pretty consistently. It's not accelerating, but it's not going away. So I think you could probably kind of build that in and then you have this race of volume against spread decline. On the securities book as I mentioned, we are rolling off yields off various things of call it 3.25%, replacing it with 2.5% to 2.75%. We are also lightening, for what it's worth, taking on less spread duration or spread product. We've been using swaps more than we have in the past. We see opportunities in the municipal space and isolated pockets, but it's tough. Again, the same things that are impacting corporate spreads are impacting securities and the attractiveness of securities. So we're being pretty careful there.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And lastly, within your NII, have you had any meaningful changes from deltas in premium amortization?","Robert Q. Reilly","No.","William S. Demchak","No.","Operator","Next question from the line of Kevin Barker with Compass Point.","Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Could you help us understand the increase in the installment home equity loans? You've had 8 straight quarters of home equity installment loan growth. Could you just walk through some of the main drivers of what's occurring right now? And are you -- what the new yields you are seeing given the move in the long end of the yield curve?","Robert Q. Reilly","Well, in terms of just the growth on the installment loans, that's a function largely of our clients locking in the lower interest rates across the spectrum, across the consumer spectrum from the mass to the high net worth. We've seen it in all the portfolios along all the client segments. So we would say that's largely rate driven in terms of being able to fix or refinance any other type of debt. And what was the second part of the question?","William S. Demchak","Just rate, I mean, risk-adjusted spread on that product over some 10-year term rate has been pretty consistent. I don't know what we're booking today but think about it in terms of live rate sheets that you'd quote on a fixed-rate product at the right risk premium, and it moves with interest rates outright.","Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then given the massive increase in home equity broadly across the nation, are you seeing signs that borrowers may start utilizing their lines of credit outside of what you have in your nonstrategic portfolio?","William S. Demchak","Nothing...","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes, we haven't seen a lot of that on the...","Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then finally, on the mortgage banking side. So are you seeing declines in HARP volumes due to the higher rates or are HARP-eligible borrowers still willing to take on these mortgages even though rates have been -- rates are still fairly attractive compared to where HARP-eligible borrowers sit today?","William S. Demchak","Well, I mean, we've seen volume declines clearly as a function of rate, but we're also going to see just burning through the population of eligible borrowers. So you're getting declines on both sides, I would suspect.","Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","So you would say it's relatively in line with the rest of the market?","William S. Demchak","In terms of our refi percentage drop versus other mortgage originators or...?","Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Yes, HARP versus refi and how that's come through for your mortgage originations.","William S. Demchak","Well, I don't have...","Robert Q. Reilly","The composition of those, yes.","William S. Demchak","We fell pretty consistent on the percentage of HARP versus our total volume.","Robert Q. Reilly","32%.","William S. Demchak","Yes, HARP was -- exactly, so that remains about the same.","Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then it can't quite tell given that you have an average balance on your mortgage servicing rights that increased 25% quarter-over-quarter. But on a quarter-end basis, did you also have a significant markup in the MSR? And what was the main driver of that given rates have been relatively benign through the quarter?","William S. Demchak","We had I think a de minimis markup, but model adjustment driven. We remain, based on the surveys we participate in on where we mark our book, very comfortable and somewhat conservative relative to what we see in the market.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question is from the line of Steve Scinicariello from UBS.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones for you. Just wanted to follow up on your comment, Bill, about the productivity in the Southeast being half of the more mature markets. I'm just kind of curious how you go about ramping that up and how long does it take before they kind of are equivalent to your more normal operations.","William S. Demchak","Yes. The half-full, half-empty argument. It's going to take a while. We were very explicit that we kind of staffed full teams in the newer markets largely with no client book. So if you think of what's happening down there versus a market like Pittsburgh or Philly, in those markets, we have all hunters. They're out gathering clients and then cross-selling new clients as opposed to sitting on existing books of business. So that's what causes the productivity to be so much less. But through time, we continue to build as we have as we add new clients and then we cross-sell new clients. We'll build that to where we want to be. So I don't have a timeline on it. We track progress, always one step forward and be better tomorrow than we were today, and that continues to work for us. But it is a big opportunity.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It definitely sounds like it. And then just unrelated question, just on the mortgage repurchase provisions, saw a nice recovery or going the other way this quarter, but just kind of curious as you kind of look out, and we see some of the peers kind of cutting checks to settle issues out there, what's your kind of opinion on kind of where you are in terms of risk exposure? And we saw a good move this quarter. I mean, is that something that you guys would consider or are you just satisfied with your reserves and risk?","William S. Demchak","No, no. Look, this quarter's numbers, we're continually refining estimates for reserves across any number of categories, so don't read too much into the number you see this quarter. But we, like others, would like to put this behind us. And we're working with Fannie and Freddie and would like to come to a settlement. It's kind of on their timeline, not ours. We're reserved for everything we know about. But as we've proven in the past, we don't know everything. But no, we'd like to put that behind us.","Operator","The next question from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just I was wondering, I know that you don't really want to talk about your 2014 kind of target for expense improvement, but you did talk about the process. Can you expand a little bit on the process that you're going through, and what sort of things you're looking at? Is that something...","William S. Demchak","Well, this productivity enhancement or process improvement that I talk about, think about we've done for the last 6 or 7 years starting with Riggs and Mercantile, National City, RBC, a number of bank acquisitions and then integrations where we -- during the course of time, you put everything on hold to do the integration and you kind of stop process. And you put together the companies, but you never take a timeout to basically refine the core processes going on in the company. And that's what we need to do. So think about that in terms of loan servicing systems. By one count, I think we had 11 loan systems. We probably need 4. There were logical reasons as to why we kept them when we did it. You look back today, and it seems illogical. There's a lot of things that we can do through automation, consolidation of systems and sites and process that's going to take time. It's going to take invested dollars to save dollars. But it's something we need to do to make this company a more efficient company in the long term.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just a small question. I mean, you mentioned the 10.4 million Visa shares. What's the process that gets you to decide when you sell those shares?","William S. Demchak","I mean, it's -- look, it's been a great investment to hold on to. It certainly...","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. 735 million today, right?","William S. Demchak","Yes. But it's quite clearly, I mean, it's a noncore asset for us, and it's something that we've been pretty public that through time we'll liquidate the position. So we look at opportunities to do so with counterparties. We look at the value of the shares, and I would expect all else equal that you'll see us continue to move it out kind of on the same timeline that we've done in the past.","Robert Q. Reilly","Market conditions being...","William S. Demchak","Yes.","Operator","Next question from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Bill, maybe you can share with us your thoughts on capital levels. I recognize that the regional banks like PNC have not been given their final Basel III Tier 1 common ratio. Yes, you have the 7%, but we don't know yet about SIFI buffers for the regional banks. JPMorgan and Citi obviously have their SIFI buffers. Both have said they're going to run around 10% to 10.5%, which is above the required 9.5%. What you think, when you run PNC, what kind of buffer do you think you want to have, whatever the number turns out to be, whether it's 7.5% or 7.25%, how much do you want to be over whatever your final number is?","William S. Demchak","The way we think about it is when you go through the CCAR process, if you could see it in our last year results, if you think about the drop from whatever you hold to your outcome in the mild case or the drop in the severe case, right, we want to maintain a buffer so that in a mild case, we don't drop to the 7%, and in a severe case we obviously stay above the 4.5%. And I think for us in the industry, that's going to sort of define the excess that you hold in the end driven by your declines as you go through the CCAR process. Now if we get assigned a 1% buffer, which, by the way, I think is highly unlikely, but let's assume that they added some buffer to our minimum 7%, then what I would tell you is that on my -- or to the 4.5% goes to 5.5%, the 7% to 8%, then I would tell you is that on my mild stress, I can't go below 8%. And on my severe stress, I can't go below 5.5%. And we'll drive what we hold as a function of the balance sheet and the environment that we find ourselves in. Clearly, if you look at last year's results, our decline in outright capital levels, so losses as a percentage of capital, given the risk profile we hold was pretty manageable, and that's what kind of has given rise to our suggested boundaries today or guidelines today of 8% to 8.5%. That could change through time for any number of reasons though. It's not a static number.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Have you guys discussed or thought about what you might be considering -- and you may have touched on this early in your earlier remarks, what type of capital return you may request in the 2014 CCAR?","William S. Demchak","We haven't. I mean, our bias is to do more rather than less. Again, but we've got to take that first through, that -- see what the CCAR instructions are and what the guidelines are from the Fed, and we'll work with our board. But our bias is to do more rather than less, and we'll have to work within the instructions to figure out what that number is.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And one final question, shifting on -- you really started to separate yourself from others on your views of Retail Banking and really pushing it hard to try to get that optimum mix of what type of delivery channels you want. Do you have any idea yet of 5 years from now or maybe even little longer term what the shrinkage in, not necessarily footprint in the storefronts or branch fronts, but in square footage, do you think there could be a 20%, 30% reduction in total square footage of retail branches in the PNC system in the end because of these alternative delivery channels that you guys maximize?","William S. Demchak","I hadn't thought of the question that way before. But if you just think about our new branch profile for the digital branches, even if we had the same physical number of locations, you would easily get there on square footage. I don't know if that's a 5-year phenomenon or what timeline that is. But practically, as we build out a digitally thin network, and by the way, you hear other banks talking about the same thing. I just don't know if they're doing it as aggressively as us. But yes, I think that your square footage drops pretty substantially through time while you still maintain physical presence and serve your customers.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Correct, and I know there's a lot of talk about that physical presence and we may not see the unit count come down, which may be deceptive if the square footage drops.","William S. Demchak","Yes.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Dan Werner with Morningstar.","Dan Werner - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","You indicated, if I heard you correctly, that you're looking for a loan loss provision of $150 million to $225 million. Does that still imply reserve release going forward here? And I guess ultimately, where do you see the allowance being as a percentage of loans long term?","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes, I think the -- this is Rob. I think in terms of the guidance that we've given you, we would expect reserve releases along the lines of what we've done in the past assuming credit quality continues to improve. And the second part of the question on...?","Dan Werner - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Where do you see allowance as a percentage of loans long term?","William S. Demchak","Yes. So we're clearly, we're running somewhere just below 2 or over 2 if you put the marks in on our L33 [ph] loans.","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes.","William S. Demchak","Through history, given what we're seeing in this credit cycle, you would have seen reserve to total loans drop well below where we are today. At the same time, you hear very publicly regulators starting to voice concerns about reserve releases and the need to be countercyclical. I don't know where that plays out, right? We have accounting guidelines we follow and model based reserves with a little bit of judgment with regulators who are getting concerned with the industry, not with us necessarily, on reserve releases. So we'll follow guidance from everybody who wants to give it to us. We'll run our models. If we end up holding more through time through the next cycle than we did in the last then that's fine. It's a form of capital, yes.","Dan Werner - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one last question. Any update to your position on your BlackRock holdings?","William S. Demchak","No.","Operator","Next question from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So a couple of questions. One is on just core expenses. Wanted to make sure when we hear you on stable expenses on core basis 4Q versus 3Q, we get to about $9.6 billion for annual core expense. Is that fair? Okay. So then in the past, you've been highlighting that the cost saves over and above are likely to be reinvested. So is what I'm hearing you say is the reinvestment opportunities are either fading or the time frame for reinvesting is extending and as a result, you're ending up with this net benefit for the 2013 full year?","Robert Q. Reilly","Yes, I don't know if we think about it so much in those terms. I would say you're correct in terms of the bulk of that $700 million continuous improvement number was targeted for investments in the business, which we have made. I would just say I think the company understands the need for expense control to a greater degree than we did in the past in the current environment, and we're seeing that across the company and across all the categories and that's showing up here with more savings than what we would have otherwise thought a year ago when we put the program in place.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then, I get it that you're going through the budgeting process and you can't really talk about what your next year plan is. But if I'm assuming no specific new types of investment in 2014, typically, managers are going to want to be showing improvement year-on-year in their P&L and in their pretax margin. Is that typically the way that the budgeting process goes?","Robert Q. Reilly","Well, again, while we haven't -- yes, we haven't done it, but I think we're...","William S. Demchak","The budgeting process is usually people show up with a whole bunch of wants and no [indiscernible], and then we push back and say that doesn't work. We -- you shouldn't assume that as we go into next year that we're not going to invest in the business. Clearly, we're going to do that. Our -- particularly as we think about this process reengineering and some of the automation opportunities that we have. But we'll get into that in some level of detail as we go into January and provide a little more color on next year.","William H. Callihan","I think, with that, operator, we're approaching 11:00. Are there any other questions in the queue?","Operator","We have no further questions at this time, sir.","William H. Callihan","Okay, Bill, do you want to have any final comments?","William S. Demchak","No. Thanks, everybody, for joining us. We'll talk to you again in a handful of months. Hopefully we'll get through the next week here with our debt situation with a good outcome.","William H. Callihan","Thank you, operator.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may now all disconnect your lines. Have a great day, everyone."],"17330":["PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

My name is Carlos, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PNC Financial Services Group Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bryan Gill. Sir, please go ahead.","Bryan Gill","Well, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today\u2019s conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC\u2019s Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO.","Today\u2019s presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information, as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in today\u2019s earnings release materials, as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These materials are available on our corporate website pnc.com under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of January 16, 2019, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bill Demchak.","Bill Demchak","Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. Today we reported full year 2018 results with net income of $5.3 billion or $10.71 per diluted common share. The strong year for PNC was capped by another solid quarter. You saw that we reported fourth quarter net income of $1.4 billion or $2.75 per diluted share.","We grew loans, deposits, and net interest income in the quarter and we controlled expenses. And while our provision increased reflecting loan growth, and Rob will talk more about this in a second, credit quality remained very strong for the quarter.","Non-interest income for the quarter was down, but largely due to asset management revenue driven by lower earnings from our equity investment in BlackRock and the decline includes a charge that flows through to PNC related to BlackRock's restructuring charge that you \u2013 I'm sure, you saw in their call this morning.","Pulling back to look at the year, 2018 was successful for PNC and I want to thank all of our employees for their continued hard work as well as our clients for their ongoing trust in us. For the full year, we achieved record total revenue, non-interest income and \u2013 sorry, net interest income and non-interest income were up and we generated positive operating leverage for the year.","We continued to manage expenses well even as we invested pretty heavily into our businesses and our people, and even improving our efficiency ratio through the year. We grew loans and deposits and expanded the reach of our franchise, both through our middle market expansion, you saw we moved into -- in 2018 into Denver, Houston and Nashville, but also through our successful launch of our national digital retail strategy.","Finally, we returned $4.4 billion in capital to our shareholders through repurchases and dividends. And by the way, since we began repurchasing shares in 2014, we've returned more than $16 billion in total capital through dividends and share repurchases, and our total share count has actually decreased 14% from 533 million to 457 million shares.","As we entered 2019, despite the recent market volatility, yield curve inversion and political and trade tensions, we don't think we're headed towards a recession. Consumer confidence remains high and it's going to provide support for consumer spending, which accounts as you know for over 65% of domestic GDP.","Both services and manufacturing is in the surveys -- remain at expansionary levels, although admittedly off the recent highs in our corporate clients as we talk to them, remained largely bullish.","Of course all of this could change, for example, if the government shutdown persists for a longer period of time or disagreements with China on trade aren\u2019t sorted out and the impact currently being felt by large multinational starts to trickle down to the broader economy.","We don't think that's going to be the case. Instead, we see an economy growing at over 2.5% and healthy loan demand as the re-pricing of the risk in the capital markets drives business back to the banks.","In this environment, we believe we can continue to establish new customer relationships, particularly as we keep broadening the reach of our brand. We also believe we can deepen relationships with our existing clients by delivering a superior banking and investing experience, alongside the innovative products we've been bringing to market now for customers to achieve their financial goals. Furthermore, we'll continue the path of risk and expense management that has enabled us to perform through the cycle creating long-term value for our investors through time.","We've got a lot of opportunities in front of us to grow the company responsibly simply by continuing to execute on our strategic priorities in 2019 and we are excited about the year ahead.","And with that I'm going to turn it over to Rob who\u2019s going to run you through the results in more detail and share our guidance for this year and then we'll be happy to answer any questions. Rob?","Rob Reilly","Yeah, great. Thanks, Bill and good morning, everyone. As Bill just mentioned, we reported full year net income of $5.3 billion or $10.71 per diluted common share and fourth quarter net income was $1.4 billion or $2.75 per diluted common share.","Our balance sheet is on slide four and is presented on an average basis. Total loans grew $2.6 billion or 1% to $226 billion in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Growth compared growth compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 was $4.8 billion or 2%.","Investment securities of $82.1 billion increased $1.4 billion or 2% linked quarter and $7.9 billion or a 11% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Purchases were primarily U.S. treasuries and residential mortgage-backed securities.","Our cash balances at the Fed averaged $16.4 billion for the fourth quarter, down $2.4 billion linked quarter and $8.9 billion year-over-year. Spot cash balances at the Fed were $10.5 billion at December 31st as we opportunistically invested cash and resale agreements at year-end. Deposits were up 2% on both the linked quarter and year-over-year basis.","As of December 31, 2018, our Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated to be 9.6%, up from 9.3% at September 30th. For the full year 2018, we returned $4.4 billion of capital to shareholders. This represented a 22% increase over the prior year and was comprised of $1.6 billion in common dividends and $2.8 billion in share repurchases, which included repurchases under our recently increased authorization.","Our return on average assets for the fourth quarter was 1.4%. Our return on average common equity was 11.83%, and our return on tangible common equity was 15.09%. Our tangible book value was $75.42 per common share as of December 31st, an increase of 3% compared to September 30th.","Slide five shows our loans and deposits in more detail. Average loans grew $2.6 billion or 1% linked quarter and $4.8 billion or 2% compared to the fourth quarter last year. Average commercial lending balances increased $2.3 billion linked quarter. This reflects an increase in multifamily agency warehouse lending, corporate banking, business credits, and equipment finance businesses.","If we think about our C&IB loan portfolio in three categories; secured lending, commercial real estate, and traditional cash flow, our growth continues to be driven by the secured lending business, which comprises approximately a third of our portfolio.","During the fourth quarter, the secured lending businesses, which we define as asset-backed, equipment finance and business credit, grew 4% linked quarter and 12% year-over-year. The second category, commercial real estate, excluding our multifamily agency warehouse lending declined approximately 1%. And the third category, traditional cash flow balances were relatively flat.","On a consumer side, balances increased by approximately $300 million linked quarter and $1.1 billion year-over-year. This was the sixth consecutive quarter that our average consumer portfolio grew. We had growth in residential mortgage, credit card, auto, and unsecured installment loans, while home equity and education lending continued to decline.","Deposits increased $4 billion or 2% to $267 billion in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter. Growth was largely in commercial deposits related to typical seasonality and as expected was primarily in interest-bearing accounts. Consumer deposits remained stable linked quarter.","Compared to the same quarter a year ago, total deposits increased by $5 billion or 2%, reflecting growth in both consumer and commercial balances. Our overall cumulative deposit beta increased in the fourth quarter driven by both commercial and consumer. The cumulative commercial beta is effectively at our stated level and our cumulative consumer beta increased 1% from the third quarter to 14% and remained below our stated level of 38%.","As you can see on slide six, full year 2018 revenue was a record $17.1 billion, up $803 million or 5%. Net interest income increased by $613 million or 7%, and non-interest income grew by $190 million or 3%, reflecting higher interest rates and overall business growth.","As a reminder, 2017 non-interest expense included significant items totaling approximately $500 million. Excluding these items, full year non-interest expense increased reflecting deliberate investment in our businesses, technology, and people.","For the fourth quarter, expenses declined linked quarter by $31 million or 1%. Full year provision of $408 million decreased by $33 million compared to 2017 and provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter increased $60 million to $148 million. Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail.","Turning to slide seven, full year 2018 net interest income was $9.7 billion, a record for PNC. Net interest income for 2018 increased $613 million or 7% compared with 2017, as higher earning asset yields and balances were partially offset by higher funding costs.","Our net interest margin increased in 2018 to 2.97%, up 10 basis points compared to 2017. For the fourth quarter, our net interest margin was 2.96%, a decline of 3 basis points linked quarter. The 3 basis point decline was due to a fourth quarter refinement of the calculation of average other interest earning asset, which resulted from automating certain operational processes during the quarter. As a result, average other interest earning assets increased by an immaterial amount and net interest income was unaffected, impacting NIM accordingly.","Turning to slide eight. Full year non-interest income was up $190 million, or 3%, and included a $32 million decline in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Importantly, we continue to execute on our strategy to grow our fee businesses across our franchise and those efforts help to drive record fee income in 2018 of $6.2 billion.","Taking a more detailed look at the performance in each of our fee categories. Asset management fees declined $117 million or 6% for the full year, 2017 included $254 million flow through benefit from tax legislation as a result of our equity investment in BlackRock. Excluding this benefit, asset management fees were up $137 million or 8%.","However on a linked-quarter basis, asset management fees declined $58 million, driven by $47 million in lower earnings from PNC's investment in BlackRock, including $10 million flow-through impact related to BlackRock's recently announced restructuring charge. PNC's asset management fees also declined linked-quarter, primarily driven by lower average equity mark.","Consumer services fees grew $87 million, or 6%, for the full year, driven by higher debit card activity, brokerage fees and credit card activity net of rewards. Compared to the third quarter, consumer services fees increased by $10 million, or 3%.","Corporate services fees increased to $107 million, or 6%, for the full year, reflecting higher treasury management and M&A advisory fees. Linked-quarter corporate services fees grew by $3 million, or 1%, including higher loan syndication fees.","Residential mortgage non-interest income declined in both full year and linked-quarter comparison, as volumes and margins remain challenged. The linked quarter decline was driven by $19 million negative adjustment for residential mortgage servicing rights valuation in the fourth quarter, compared with no adjustment in the third quarter.","Service charges on deposits increased 3%, both linked quarter and full year, reflecting increased customer activity and product enhancements. Finally, other non-interest income was $325 million for the fourth quarter and included $42 million benefit from Visa derivative adjustments, primarily related to the change in Visa share price during the quarter.","Turning to slide nine, our full year 2018 expenses were $10.3 billion compared to $10.4 billion in 2017. As I previously mentioned, 2017 included approximately $500 million of significant items impacting the year-over-year comparison.","Taking a look at the fourth quarter, expenses declined $31 million, or 1%, compared with the third quarter. Lower personnel expense and the elimination of the $36 million quarterly FDIC surcharge assessment more than offset seasonal increases in occupancy and equipment and higher digital marketing expense. Our efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 59% and 60% for the full year 2018, the lowest in several years.","Expense management continues to be a focus for us and we remain disciplined in our overall approach. As you know, we had a 2018 goal of $250 million in cost saving through our continuous improvement program and we successfully completed actions to achieve that goal. For 2019, we've increased our annual CIP target by $50 million to $300 million.","Our credit quality metrics are represented on slide 10 and remained strong. Full year provision for loan losses totaled $408 million, down from $441 million in 2017. Net charge-offs also declined from $457 million in 2017 to $420 million in 2018. For 2018, reserves to total loans declined slightly to 1.16% from 1.18%.","On a linked-quarter basis provision increased $60 million in the fourth quarter due to growth in both commercial and consumer loans, as well as the impact of a handful of specific loan reserves in the commercial portfolio.","As we've highlighted in the past given the absolute low levels of provisions relative to the size of the loan portfolios, we're likely to experience some volatility quarter-over-quarter as the timing of specific reserves or specific releases is not uniform, but does tend to level out when viewed on a full year basis. Importantly, we're not seeing any broad trends within these specific reserves that would indicate potentially significant deterioration.","Nonperforming loans were down $171 million or 9% compared to December 31, 2017 with declines in both commercial and consumer loans. And year-over-year total delinquencies were down $35 million or 2%. As you can see on the slide these credit metrics have continued to improve over the last five years to very low levels.","In summary, PNC reported a successful 2018 and we're well-positioned for 2019. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we expect continued steady growth in GDP. We now expect one increase of 25 basis points in short-term interest rates this year occurring in September.","Based on these assumptions our full year 2019 guidance compared to the full year 2018 results is as follows; we expect loan growth to be in the range of 3% to 4%; we expect revenue growth in the upper end of the low single-digit range; we expect expense growth in the lower end of the low single-digit range; and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 17%. Based on this guidance, we believe we will continue to deliver positive operating leverage in 2019.","Looking at the first quarter of 2019 compared to fourth quarter 2018 results, we expect loans to be stable; we expect total net interest income to be stable, reflecting two fewer days in the quarter; we expect fee income to be down low single digits; we expect other noninterest income to be between $275 million and $325 million excluding net securities and Visa activity; we expect expenses to be stable; and we expect provision to be between $125 million and $175 million.","And with that Bill and I are ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","John McDonald","Hi, good morning, guys. Just wondering, if you could drill down a little bit in terms of what you're seeing in terms of credit quality understanding, obviously, we're coming off of a really good credit performance the last couple of years for you and the industry. Just, kind of, wondering what in your models drove the increase in provision this quarter and for a slightly higher rate of provisioning called for in the first quarter. How much of that is driven by growth, and how much by changes in credit quality or the early indicators that you see in your models?","Rob Reilly","Hi, John, this is Rob. Yeah, so couple of things on that. Again just to reiterate what I just said and Bill mentioned credit quality is really strong. By virtually every measure, charge-offs down, NPAs down, delinquencies down year-over-year. So that hasn't changed.","In regard to the provision for the fourth quarter, I\u2019d chalk that up to growth and also some of these specific names \u2013 of this handful of names that we had. So when you take a look at our total 2018 provision of $400 million down year-over-year, it's \u2013 we're bouncing off some pretty low levels. So that explains the fourth quarter of 2018. For the first quarter of 2019 going forward, a couple of things. One, again, credit quality we see is good. We don't see any broad trends in any asset categories that would suggest substantial deterioration that I mentioned but we do see growth.","Bill Demchak","But frankly, any deterioration, I mean you used the word substantial, but there's not \u2013 John, we had four commercial credits go NPA in the fourth quarter and they were all completely idiosyncratic associated with strange things. So nothing kind of based on the broader economy. And even in consumer, where there's been a slight tick up in auto, that's still going back to hurricane \u2013 to the hurricane damage. There's really nothing there.","Rob Reilly","No. I think that is right. And just to complete that thought on the first quarter. I do -- and Bill mentioned, commercial is so low, total charge-offs in our commercial portfolio in 2018 were $25 million on a $150 billion portfolio. So at some point that's got to come up a bit, but it's gradual.","Bill Demchak","Yes, but the short answer to your question on the guidance for the first quarter is, it just can't -- we don't see anything. It just can't stay this at that low forever.","Rob Reilly","That's my point, right.","Bill Demchak","So we kind of tell you a slightly higher number though on the back of the fact that everybody is talking about a slightly weaker economy, but we don't see anything today that says that's true.","John McDonald","Okay. Got it. That's really helpful. And in terms of the revenue outlook, you've given an outlook on revenues for 2019, upper end of low-single digits. So just kind of wondering what your confidence level in the revenue outlook? Maybe how you see it split a little bit between NII and fees? And where do you enter the year with good revenue momentum and tailwinds? And where might the revenue outlook be a little more challenging? Thanks.","Rob Reilly","Sure. So our guidance calls for revenue, the upper end of low-single digits, which is connected to our loan outlook which is 3% to 4% growth. And you can sort of do the math in terms of the fee guidance being up low-single digit on the lower end. We do see in terms of the contribution of revenue, more of that growth coming from NII versus the fees, but growth in the fees.","Bill Demchak","Yes, we had absent impact of BlackRock, we had a great year this year on fees, a lot of it in corporate services that depending what market activity is, could be a little bit weaker into next year. The other thing is just in the forecast, we have included in effect the market\u2019s expectation on BlackRock inside of our fee line. So that's causing that to be somewhat subdued versus our own internal growth.","John McDonald","Okay And in terms of the net interest income Rob, do you see that growing kind of in line with the loan growth\u2026?","Rob Reilly","Yes.","John McDonald","You've got some puts and takes around the NIM obviously, but pretty much in line with loan growth?","Rob Reilly","Yes, that's right, John.","John McDonald","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Rob Reilly","Good morning, John.","John Pancari","Also on the credit front, the reserve came out around 116 basis points. Is that a fair level to assume where it holds through the year, if we don't see material change in credit? And then also I know you indicated a handful of commercial names that impacted the number or your expectation for provisioning here. Does that mean that that provision range of $125 million to $175 million could come down beyond the first quarter as we move through 2019 or do you think it stays? ","Bill Demchak","That's why we gave you a range.","Rob Reilly","That's right. That's the range, yes. And they're pretty small ranges in terms of the -- the key word is gradual. So we don't see major shifts. But I think in terms of the reserve ratio, I think, we're adequately reserved and I see that as being fairly stable.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. Got it. And then, when you look at margin, it was excluding the 3 basis point impact of that process change. It was still flat despite still the ongoing Fed hike. So can you comment on your asset sensitivity here?","I mean what do you -- what type of progression does the margin have if we see your rate assumption of one hike in 2019 playout? How do we think about the margin through 2019? And if the Fed stops and we don't get that hike, do we get some incremental expansion here in the near term or is it flat to down?","Bill Demchak","Well, you embedded a whole bunch of different issues into that question to fit. In terms of asset sensitivity, we remain asset sensitive. That could play out and will play out in NIIs as you see in our guidance, may or may not play out in NIM. So you\u2019re going to have to kind of separate the two, and we never really manage the company to NIM.","All that said, the momentum that we've had on net interest margin and the industries had on the back of fairly predictable rate hikes is going to slow down. So my best guess is our NIM, not our net interest income, is going to bounce around current levels through the course of the year.","I would tell you that this quarter it doesn't change income, but we had the issue on average earning assets, we had some hedge ineffectiveness that went against us, we had a lower swaps balance, we had a whole bunch of things that have nothing to do with economics that impact that number, that could have easily printed the other way.","So I don't think you're going to see big pickup from us or anybody else going forward. It's not related to asset sensitivity. It's related just rise in rates in the short end. But I'm not worried about that. I think we'll -- as we said, we'll continue to see growth in NII.","Rob Reilly","And we don't provide NIM guidance, but just to reiterate Bill's point, we'd expect this to be the right -- that where we are now is what our current rate expectations are for the short term.","Bill Demchak","Yes.","John Pancari","Got it. Thanks a lot.","Rob Reilly","2.96. Yes.","John Pancari","Right. Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning, guys.","Bill Demchak","Hi, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","I apologize if you touched on this. There's multiple conference calls going on, as you know. How is the competition on the C&I side? If you could compare it throughout 2018, did it ease up at all in the fourth quarter as the shadow banking industry, if you will, run into difficulties or whether it's tough as ever? If you can give us some color there on the C&I competition.","Bill Demchak","Well, I think what you're going after here is that the crack in credit spreads in the capital markets impact and offer opportunity to the banks. And the answer to that is yes. So what banks are willing to do on the lending side has backed off at this point in terms of where they\u2019d underwrite and syndicate, and you've seen some people have run into some hung deals.","That doesn't play into our model that much because we're not really in the leverage lending business, What has happened though is the clients who are, kind of, I call them the five Bs, so they use banks and they also use the bond markets, they're coming back to banks as the price differential has moved in favor of banks and the bottom market has at least thus far not really opened up for them. So we see that benefit.","As it rates to head-to-head bank competition on a traditional bank name in middle market cash flow, it's still brutal that hasn't changed. So maybe the simplest way to answer that question is bank-to-bank competition is still fierce bank-to-capital market competition has moved in favor of banks.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then the follow-up on that, if you take recession off the table, I don't think anybody believed we're going to have recession in 2019. So if you take that off the table and some episodic global risk of bill. When you guys look at your business for this year what are the risks that you're focusing in on to make sure that you're not caught by these risks \u2013 earnings or revenues?","Bill Demchak","Yeah. So, we actually \u2013 we've done a look at who might be impacted by tariffs both directly and trickle down. And we actually have a specific reserves against that inside of our credit book today.","But by enlarge we served the domestic economy. And the domestic economy, you've heard me say this before is really strong and our clients remain strong. Now they ultimately can be impacted, obviously, by the global economy and by the trickle-down effect to some of the troubles the larger multinational face because of their global economy. But that's far we don't see it.","And at the margin if \u2013 the worse case happens, we won't have any concentrated impact as it relates to industries or businesses we cover. We will simply be impacted as a function of the impacted expect from a slower economy broadly defined.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Hi, good morning. Thanks guys. I got a question on the deposit side. Looks, you continue to have a really good overall growth and obviously the deposit cost has been going up. Can you just talk through just the deposit competition side? And given your view of just one hike this year, how do you anticipate deposit competition to evolve in this presumably slower than previously anticipated rate cycle?","Bill Demchak","Yeah, it's a good question. And it varies by what we're trying to do. So on our national digital strategy, we're playing principally against the online banks and we're all paying largely a \u2013 at market \u2013 money market rate. And I think that continues.","It's interesting our retail data this quarter actually was less than it was in the third quarter, and then kind of bounce around as we go through the year. But we're not seeing at least thus far massive competition for traditional deposits. We continue to pull deposits from as does the industry flows from smaller banks to larger banks. And I think that's rate independent that services depended and I think that trend continues. And then you have this overlay of the continued shrinkage of the Fed balance sheet which draws cash out of the system.","So there's a lot of factors in there. I don't see a massive shift through 2019 and the trends that we've seen thus far. Through time you will see greater portions of our total deposits coming from the online channel, which of course will change our beta. But today it\u2019s such a small number. It doesn't really impacted.","Ken Usdin","And maybe as a follow up. Can you just flush out, just the progress you're making on the national strategy and the type of growth that you're seeing from the new markets and the new endeavor?","Rob Reilly","Yes, on the consumer side. So we also have expansion markets on the commercial side. But on the consumer side, it's going well exceeding our expectations. We've been at it now just for over three months. Balances continued to grow across a lot of geographies and 85% of those new accounts which now are getting close to the high-teens in the 10,000 \u2013 18,000 range or 85% of that is new to PNC. So we like overseeing so far but its early.","Bill Demchak","Couple of things I'd say, and by the way, we hear you guys have lot of data on this and as soon as we get enough of a track record we'll start talking about what we're seeing in terms of activity in these accounts and stuff, but a couple of things that we're seeing so far that validates some of our original thoughts.","One is that physical presence matters. So the Solutions Center we opened in Kansas City continues to draw disproportionate share in terms of origination versus online channel per capita. And people are willing to travel, they\u2019ll go do it.","Two is, the number of virtual wallet accounts that we are opening that are being used by new customers continues to surprise at least me. I think it's -- I don't know a third or 25%.","Rob Reilly","About 25, yes. About 25%.","Bill Demchak","And totally new clients to PNC, who are using us as their primary bank. And that's quite interesting to us.","Rob Reilly","And encouraging.","Bill Demchak","Yes, and we're going to have to do some analysis around that to figure out what types of activity, how sticky depositors are, how deposit trends with these accounts move so on and so forth. But so far we're pretty happy with it.","Ken Usdin","All right. Thanks very much.","Bill Demchak","Sure","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","Bryan Gill","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from the line of John McDonald of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","John McDonald","Hey, guys. Just wanted to drove a little bit on.","Bill Demchak","You\u2019re back.","John McDonald","Yes, I'm back. On the idea of operating leverage, how you guys are thinking about it in terms of the linguistic gymnastics on the outlook slide, revenues up higher end of the low single-digits that seems like it could be three and a lower end of signal to me is at one to two. So it seems like you're saying maybe 100 to 200 basis points of operating leverage. Is that like a reasonable bogey for us to think about that you guys are kind of shooting for this year? ","Rob Reilly","Yes, yes. That's right.","John McDonald","Talk about that a little bit, Rob. Yes.","Rob Reilly","Yes. No, no, that's right on. So higher end of low single digits, just average. Put a little band around 3% and lower end put a band around 1%.","Bill Demchak","John, long story short, notwithstanding the performance of our share price, we feel pretty good about 2019. And we put in the guidance.","John McDonald","Good. And that obviously, mathematically that we should grind down on your efficiency ratio if we continued with the operating leverage.","Rob Reilly","Yes. That's right. Yes. That's right.","John McDonald","Okay. ","Rob Reilly","Yes.","John McDonald","All right. Thanks guys. I won't circle back again.","Rob Reilly","John, along those lines, we did hit a five handle on the efficiency ratio there in the fourth quarter. So we're on our way.","John McDonald","Yes. No I think \u2013 yes, I think that's good to see the improvement. I think people are kind of were looking for, hoping you get below 60 and I think commitment to continue the improvement is also helpful.","Rob Reilly","Yes. Good.","Bill Demchak","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Hi. Good morning.","Bill Demchak","Hi, Erika.","Rob Reilly","Hi, Erika.","Erika Najarian","I just wanted to also clarify your full year outlook. It looks like consensus has a 6% decline in net income expectation for BlackRock in 2019. Of course, not yet adjusted for this morning. So it sounds like the revenue momentum for 2019 and positive operating leverage is actually better given that that's all coming through your revenue line. Is that a good interpretation of how we're thinking about BlackRock versus core trend?","Rob Reilly","Yes. And we do use the consensus numbers for BlackRock.","Erika Najarian","Okay, perfect. And just a follow-up to Ken's question, the market is also thinking that perhaps the Fed is on a longer pause than the September hike that you're thinking embedding in your guide. But as we think about deposit reprising, particularly for money market strategy, how many quarters until the last hike does deposit pricing stopped catching up in your experience?","Bill Demchak","How many quarters until the last hike\u2026","Rob Reilly","You mean how many quarters after the last hike?","Erika Najarian","Yes, how many quarters after the last hike?","Bill Demchak","Yes. Through history, there's been a pretty long tail. The problem today, of course, is you have -- for the first time since we've gone through this, you have a lot of online accounts at the same time as you have the Fed shrinking its balance sheet. And you have smaller banks really competing on a rate as they have to hold on to clients.","So I don't know how that plays out. I can sit here and guess for you, but I think those are the factors that are going to impact what happens to deposit rates as we move forward. I think that for banks such as ourselves, our ability for our core clients to continue to lag at the margin will remain largely on the back of the services we provide them.","Rob Reilly","Yes. I think that's right. And commercial, of course, Erika, as you know, has moved. So it's all about the consumer deposits.","Bill Demchak","Yes.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And looking at your CET1 ratios and the potential Fed proposal, I'm wondering if we should expect a continuation of increase in terms of buyback request from the Fed, particularly given the stock price has arrived a little bit relative to peers?","Bill Demchak","The answer is yes. Although, remember the proposals that are out are unlikely to have any impact on this coming CCAR and it's unclear in terms of the new CCAR guidance, how much of that will be included in this year CCAR, I think they\u2019re still sorting through that. But at the margin both of those things will give us increased flexibility and where otherwise by certainly at this share price to be pretty heavy on the buyback.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you.","Rob Reilly","And, of course, we haven't seen the scenario yet. So, it\u2019s just a speculation.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.","Saul Martinez","Hey, good morning. Can you just give us an update on where you stand on your CCAR preparation, when you think \u2013 when you plan to start with parallel runs or unless you've already done so?","Bill Demchak","Yeah. Sure.","Saul Martinez","And just when can we \u2013 and just any update on when do you think we can have some estimate of the upfront impact?","Bill Demchak","Yeah, so we're busy working on it and making good progress. We had said before, it's our intention to begin parallel run here in the first half of 2019. We're on track to do that. So in regard to being able to provide you with information and insight from that, sometime in the second half.","Saul Martinez","Sometime in the second half. Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot.","Bill Demchak","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Kevin Barker","Good morning.","Rob Reilly","Good morning, Kevin.","Kevin Barker","In regards to \u2013 following-up on some of the credit comments there was a particular pickup in equipment lease financing on the 30-day delinquency rate. Is there anything in particular there you've seen that you can expand upon?","Bill Demchak","No \u2013 yeah, Kevin, there was a tick up there and it was in the 30-day category there. Equipment leasing to some of those delinquencies are elevated relative to a software change that we made that created some administrative delinquencies. So there\u2019s some elevation that's coming from that that's part of that, otherwise it\u2019s just seasonal.","Rob Reilly","But differently it\u2019s not really a change in credit conditions there. The system is processing certain payments in a way that cause us to book them as delinquent, whereas, the old system didn't do that.","Bill Demchak","Yeah. Administrative.","Rob Reilly","And we\u2019ll clear those up.","Kevin Barker","So, do you make a broad administrative change in your systems to impact your calculation premium on top of this?","Rob Reilly","No, it's two completely separate, completely separate things.","Bill Demchak","But it is \u2013 yeah, it is totally separate thing. But I mean we are \u2013 look, we put in a completely new leasing system that has a couple bumps that are causing us this issue you see on delinquencies. The automation inside of the balance sheet calculation is a good thing.","We're just automating manual processes and in the process of doing that we found the calculation difference that historically have been off in a de minimis amount on the balance sheet. All these things are good. We're basically getting rid of manual stuff and putting in new system. So we find things every time we do it.","Kevin Barker","Right. And so no deterioration in credit. And it\u2019s just\u2026","Rob Reilly","No, I mean, all the way back to the beginning. There\u2019s nothing that we see in any of these books that is suggesting anything but the continuation of the trend. We've always hedge that with the basic notion that just can't stay this good forever.","Kevin Barker","Got it, okay. And then regards to your loan growth of 3%, 4%, and with commercial competition, I guess easing from the non-banks and potentially giving a little bit of a tailwind possibly from there, absent a slowdown in the broader economy. Are you seeing any of the pickup in the consumer side as well, given some of the changes that you've been making over the last, I'd say a year or two in order to focus more on the consumer?","Bill Demchak","That work continues and you've seen for I don't know, five or six quarters.","Rob Reilly","Six quarters.","Bill Demchak","To grow consumer and we ought to be able to continue to do that despite the run-off that we continue to see in home equity in our student lending. I\u2019d like to think that would accelerate its -- you are running against a pretty big headwind in terms of those run-offs, but we're doing it without changing the credit risk that we are taking simply by executing on good products in getting good, better penetration into our existing client base. So I don't know if it accelerates but it ought to continue.","Rob Reilly","Yes, certainly continue, but in terms of our guidance with 3% to 4%, we do see more growth on the commercial side than consumer but to Bill\u2019s point, growth in both portfolios.","Bill Demchak","By the way, some of the growth in commercial will continue to see growth as we have in our secured businesses, specialty businesses absent real estate. But the other thing is, we are unlikely to have some of the purpose full run-off we saw in 2018 repeat itself and certain segments that just weren\u2019t kind of paying the freight. So we feel pretty good about that number.","Kevin Barker","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes. Hi. This is Rob on for Matt. I'm just curious on your new expansion markets, I was just curious if you can provide an update on progress you're making there just how things are tracking versus your expectations?","Bill Demchak","Yes, it's a good report there in terms of, again these are relatively new. But in each one of those markets we are growing loans faster than that legacy book. And then I think what we are most encouraged about is the composition of the business, which is relationship oriented and I think close to half of our sales are in non-credit. So it is not just blind participation in credits, what we intended to do was to build out our model in these markets. So, so far very good.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, and then just on your liquidity position. You mentioned, you invested in some resale agreements at year-end?","Bill Demchak","Yes. Yes.","Unidentified Analyst","Is that corresponds to the increase in other assets on a period end basis? And then maybe just an update on your thinking about continued deployment from here?","Bill Demchak","Yes, sure. No, it does thinking that\u2019s just a year-end. So that was just for a short period of time. Going forward in terms of our liquidity, no, we feel good about in terms of where we are. We are satisfying our current LCR obligations, a north of 100%. There is a proposal for us to go lower but that won't likely occur substantially in 2019. So we are good. We have balances roughly in the $16 billion range of the Fed. We could redeploy those in other level one securities, higher-yielding securities and we may do that as the year plays out.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thanks.","Bill Demchak","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please go ahead.","Brian Klock","Hey, good morning, gentlemen.","Bill Demchak","Good morning.","Brian Klock","Just had a quick question on -- you talked about some of the loan growth earlier from the line of business in a collateral type perspective. I was looking at table six in your sup-pack that\u2019s just on the end of period. On the C&I, you had a pretty good growth that drove a lot of the C&I growth in retail, wholesale trade and then the other sort of catch-all industries. That was up $2 billion sequentially. Is there anything that jumps out within that growth? Anything that's a little bit \u2013 because like I said, just from the fourth quarter it was so much more significant than you've seen in another quarters? And was that part of what you\u2026?","Bill Demchak","I don't have the table in front of me, but if it's inclusive of our asset-based lending, a lot of that will come from year-end inventory build for retailers that were otherwise clients, but basically draw down pretty heavy as it gets ready for the Christmas season.","Brian Klock","Got you.","Rob Reilly","Yes. I'm aware of the table, but there's nothing unusual there.","Bill Demchak","I think that probably came from asset-based lending and the traditional draw down on the lines as they build inventory.","Brian Klock","Got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, I guess a follow-up on the liquidity discussion. And Bill, you mentioned earlier, I guess, obviously, with the Fed pulling liquidity out of the system, I guess when it was on autopilot, I guess well, if they remain on autopilot.","But your DDA balances have been declining and like the industry had throughout the year. And it seems like obviously a lot of that\u2019s in your C&IB segment. The retail growth in DDA has been pretty good. So I guess is there any visibility into, like, when could that stabilize? Or when do you think that DDA runoff in the C&IB might kind of abate?","Bill Demchak","I don't know that I have any model, the insight into it. I think, the simple notion that rates are higher than zero and have been for some period of time now, has caused corporates to get smart about raising money. My guess is that they're already doing that. They don't choose to do it 50% on the way and then weigh, because they're giving out money everyday. So my guess is we're probably where we're going to be.","Rob Reilly","To add to that point. Time will tell, but if you'd take a look just on the commercial side, in terms of non-interest-bearing accounts. They did decline in the fourth quarter but they declined at a much lower rate than what we saw at the beginning of the year, to your point.","Brian Klock","Yes. That\u2019s fair. That\u2019s fair. Appreciate it. Thanks guys.","Bill Demchak","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions on the phone line. Returning the call\u2026","Bill Demchak","Well, thank you everybody.","Rob Reilly","Yes. Thank you. Thanks.","Bill Demchak","Yes.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PNC Financial Services Group Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bill Callihan. Sir, please go ahead.","William H. Callihan","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Rohr; and Rick Johnson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Actual results of future events could differ possibly materially from those anticipated in our statements and from historical performance due to a variety of risks and other factors.","Information about such factors as well as GAAP reconcilements and other information on non-GAAP financial measures we may discuss is included in today's conference call, earnings release, related presentation materials and in our 10-K, 10-Q and various other SEC filings and investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website at pnc.com under the Investor Relations section.","These statements speak only as of January 18, 2012, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim Rohr.","James E. Rohr","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. In today's presentation, I will focus on PNC's full year achievements and financial highlights, which included strong growth in clients, loans and deposits. Looking ahead, we believe we're well positioned to deliver strong results again in 2012. Rick will take you through a more in-depth review of the fourth quarter results and our outlook for the full year. ","Looking back 12 months, when 2011 began, it was predicted that banks would be facing an operating environment dominated by low interest rates, slow economic growth and new and challenging regulations. Well, as it turned out, 2000, in fact -- 2011 was, in fact, all that it was advertised to be and then some. In spite of that, overall, PNC had a good year of solid accomplishments, focusing on what we do best: serving customers, cross-selling products and services and managing risk and expenses. ","Let me share some highlights. For the year, we earned $3.1 billion in net income or $5.64 per diluted common share. With our recognized brand, innovative product offerings and strong cross-selling ability, we saw remarkable growth in the number of customers we served. In fact, our retail checking relationships and corporate business clients are at record levels.","All of our markets, all of our markets, we're ahead of their sales goals in 2011. And due to our success in adding new clients, we saw a strong full year loan growth of $8.4 billion or 6%. Fourth quarter loan growth was $4.5 billion or 12% on an annualized basis. An important item, full year net interest income, was driven by stable core net interest income due to higher spot loan balances and the impact of actions that we took to reduce our funding costs. These were good results in the current low interest rate environment.","Our fee income in 2011 was solid despite a series of regulatory changes. We see good opportunities for fee income growth this year as we continue to expand our franchise.","Overall, our credit metrics showed significant improvement on a year-over-year basis. Our balance sheet remained highly liquid and core funded with an 85% loan-to-deposit ratio. Our Tier 1 common capital ratio remained strong and it is estimated to be 10.3% as of December 31, and we believe that we are well positioned for the Basel III capital requirements.","And by leveraging our strong capital position, we were able to announce plans for a number of strategic acquisitions last year, which will expand our presence in very attractive markets in the Southeast.","We received regulatory approvals to acquire RBC Bank (USA). We expect to close in March subject to the remaining customary closing conditions. And when we do, we expect that acquisition to be accretive to our 2012 earnings excluding integration costs. ","And last but not least, part of our regular assessment of contingencies and commitments includes residential mortgage foreclosure-related matters, including ongoing governmental ones. As a result of some recent discussions, we increased our accrual for these matters in the fourth quarter to $240 million or $324 million for the year. And in spite of these usual -- unusual items taken in the fourth quarter, we believe that 2011 was yet another good year for PNC.","Now turning to our business segments. A key test is the ability to acquire and retain customers. For PNC, 2011 was an excellent year for customer growth, our best ever actually. ","Let me begin with Retail Banking. We recognize there are significant changes in the consumer behavior taking place today. Check-writing continues to decline, branch utilization is lower and electronic transactions are increasing. And we took a number of steps last year to position us to have additional growth in 2012.","Our Asset Management Group had a solid full year earnings in 2011 despite volatile markets.","Hang on a second. Excuse me, one second.","Let's go back. Looking ahead for the Retail Bank, we'll be focused on 3 issues: One, reducing the costs to serve our Retail Banking customers; second, branch optimization; and third, growing our higher valued client base.","Moving to the Corporate & Institutional Bank. They had a very good year last year with increased earnings compared to 2010. We saw average loans increase for the full year led by growth in commercial and asset-based lending. In the fourth quarter, we saw lending increase in every loan category and across nearly all of our markets. We added primary clients in our corporate bank at a record pace. For the full year, new primary client growth was 1,165, an increase of 15% over 2010, which was a record year itself. In terms of customer growth, these were primarily commercial and middle market customers. I should add that this marks the second consecutive year that we have added more than 1,000 new primary clients.","Turning to Asset Management. They reported a solid full year earnings in 2011 despite volatile markets. New primary client acquisition grew by 26% for the year, reflecting strong referral activity from Retail and Corporate and Institutional Banking. For the year, nearly 1\/3 of sales came from these referral channels. The customer growth helped to drive dramatic change in asset inflows.","We've made significant investments in this business in 2011 in terms of people and technology as we seek to expand our abilities to serve our growing retirement and investment market. We added 290 employees, primarily in the front lines, most of these deployed in our higher-potential markets such as Chicago, Florida, Milwaukee and D.C. And we have plans to hire additional staff in 2012.","In terms of technology, we launched PNC Wealth Insight in September. This tool is clearly giving us competitive advantage. Some 12,000 clients have now access to it and more than 50% of them are active users. We'll continue to invest in this business as we see opportunities to capture a greater share of the current customers' investable assets, which we estimate to be more than $1 trillion in our market. ","And residential mortgage had a good year in terms of loan production. Mortgage loan applications were $11.4 billion for the year, up 9% from 2010. ","Overall, this was a very good year for customer growth and that paves the way for additional success in 2012.","Now beyond our current year returns, I think it's important to take a longer view of PNC's performance. Since the economic downturn began in mid-2007, it's clear that PNC's management team has navigated this environment well and delivered long-term value to the shareholders. As you can see on Slide 6, our tangible book value per share has more than doubled during the period. And our pretax pre-provision earnings per share have increased by 40%. When we compare both of these metrics to our peers, you can see we dramatically outperformed them during this period and we're very optimistic about the long-term value that we will provide to our shareholders.","Now as I reflect on the year, we took a number of significant actions in 2011, many of which are listed on Slide 7, to help or manage risk. Overall, we've been able to return to a moderate risk profile. Now clearly, challenges remain but I believe adherence to the risk management principles we have established will continue to serve us well.","In terms of our earnings outlook for the year, Rick will give you some more detail, but we continue to assume a continuation of the current slow growth, low interest-rate economy in a dynamic regulatory environment. I believe that we will continue to grow customer relationships and loans to drive revenue, manage credit costs and expenses and maintain strong liquidity and capital levels this year.","With that background, there are 2 key items I see for 2012: First, we expect legacy PNC full year earnings to improve next year because we believe we will grow loans, cross-sell our customers and focus on managing our costs and expenses -- credit costs and expenses. Second, we expect our planned acquisition of RBC to be accretive to 2012 earnings, excluding the integration costs. ","With that discussion about 2012 behind us, Rick will give you more detail about our fourth quarter results and our full year outlook for 2012. Rick?","Richard J. Johnson","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter net income was $493 million or $0.85 per diluted common share. Now before we get started with the details, let me walk you through a couple of adjustments included in the fourth quarter results. ","Let's start with expenses. We had a charge of $240 million or $0.30 per share related to residential mortgage foreclosure-related activities, primarily as a result of ongoing governmental matters. We also had a noncash charge of approximately $198 million or $0.24 per share associated with redeeming $750 million of our trust preferred securities. As this was high-cost, long-term paper, this should reduce future funding costs by $30 million annually.","We also had an increase of $103 million or $0.13 per share in personnel costs, primarily driven by increases in stock market prices including PNC stock price and PNC's higher business production in the fourth quarter.","Given these unusual fourth quarter items, I should add that we expect total expenses in the first quarter of 2012 to be substantially lower and more consistent with expenses in the third quarter of 2011.","On the revenue side, regulatory changes on debit card transactions reduced consumer service fees by $75 million or $0.09 per share. When considering all these adjustments, our fourth quarter results reflect a solid earnings performance.","Now let's talk about the fundamentals of our business performance beginning with our balance sheet on Slide 9. Starting with assets, loans increased by $4.5 billion or 3% linked quarter or 12% on an annualized basis. Core commercial loans increased by $3.6 billion on a linked-quarter basis with gains in virtually every client segment and market. For the full year, core commercial loans were up by $9.6 billion. Core consumer loans increased $1.4 billion, primarily due to higher indirect auto and education lending. ","You will notice that we renamed our Distressed Asset segment to the Non-strategic Assets segment. This segment includes portfolios we do not intend to grow and the vast majority of the assets are performing. We believe the new name is more appropriate.","And looking at our loan book, we see strong origination trends and a solid pipeline of business. Given our improved credit metrics, we are well positioned for future loan growth.","Turning to liabilities. Transaction deposits were up by approximately $4.6 billion or 3% linked quarter, and higher cost retail CDs were lower by $2.9 billion as we continue to reposition this book to lower our cost of funds. As a result of our efforts, our deposit cost declined 42 basis points for the quarter, a decline -- deposit costs declined to 42 basis points for the quarter, a decline of 9 basis points on a linked-quarter basis. For the full year, deposit costs were 51 basis points, which was 19 basis points lower than in 2010.","Now as you can see on Slide 10, we had another strong quarter in terms of asset quality as our overall credit metrics continued to improve. Excluding the impact of government-guaranteed loans, delinquencies, nonperforming loans and charge-offs all declined linked quarter. Given the overall improvement in our credit metrics, our provision for the quarter decreased to $190 million from $261 million last quarter.","Now let's turn to net interest income on Slide 11. Net interest income of $2.2 billion increased by $24 million linked quarter and the net interest margin of 3.86% was in line with third quarter results. In this environment, we see a $60 million linked-quarter increase in core net interest income as a very good outcome. For the fourth quarter, this performance was aided by our ability to grow loans, reprice CDs at much lower rates and reduce overall funding costs.","Provision-adjusted net interest income was also up 12% on a full year basis. The full year improvement was due to significantly lower provisioning, which was more than -- which more than offset the expected decline in purchase accounting accretion.","Looking ahead, we have about $12.5 billion in higher-cost CDs scheduled to mature in the first half of 2012. This book has a weighted average rate of about 2.5%. Given the non-relationship nature of many of these accounts, we only expect to retain about 1\/2 of the maturing CDs and we expect those to reprice on average to approximately 33 basis points. The interest expense impact of repricing this tranche of CDs is expected to be approximately $175 million in 2012. And on an annual basis, we expect the benefit will increase to about $275 million.","As you can see on Slide 12, we reported approximately $1.4 billion of noninterest income, which was essentially flat linked quarter. While our Asset Management Group continued to deliver solid results, asset management fees were lower in the fourth quarter, partially due to a noncash tax benefit that BlackRock reported in the third quarter.","Consumer service fees decreased $61 million linked quarter. This was driven by debit card interchange fees, which were down by approximately $75 million due to regulatory changes. This decline was partially offset by higher transaction volumes. ","Corporate service fees increased $79 million for the linked quarter, primarily due to the impact of a valuation impairment of commercial mortgage servicing rights in the third quarter of 2011.","Residential mortgage fees declined mainly from lower hedge gains on mortgage servicing rights. ","Deposit service charges held steady with the third quarter, which was better than expected as the third quarter results were due to seasonally high customer activity. ","And Other increased $56 million for a variety of reasons, including an increase in the value of the hedges on deferred compensation obligations related to the higher stock market prices.","The diversity of our revenue streams enabled us to achieve a solid performance in an environment that will continue to be affected by regulatory reform headwinds and implementation challenges. At the same time, we see opportunities for growth as a result of our larger franchise, our ability to cross-sell our products and services to existing clients and our excellent progress in adding new customers.","Turning to Slide 13. For the full year, expenses were up 6%. However, when you exclude the fourth quarter charges for residential mortgage foreclosure-related matters and the cost of the trust preferred securities redemption, expenses continued to be essentially flat year-over-year.","As I mentioned, fourth quarter expenses were unusually high due to $240 million of expenses related to residential mortgage foreclosure-related matters; the redemption of trust preferred securities, which resulted in a noncash charge of approximately $198 million; and a higher personnel expense of $103 million, most of which was driven by higher stock market prices and by PNC's higher business production in the fourth quarter. We do not expect quarterly expenses to remain at this level. In fact, excluding the anticipated RBC Bank first quarter integration cost of $172 million and any legal and regulatory-related contingencies that may be incurred, we expect first quarter 2012 expenses to be relatively consistent with our third quarter 2011 expenses.","As shown on Slide 14, our Tier 1 common ratio at the end of the fourth quarter is estimated to be 10.3%. That's down 20 basis points since the end of the third quarter due to strong customer loan growth. Our Tier 1 common ratio is up 50 basis points from the end of last year.","Let me give you an update on our Basel III outlook. As we've said before, we are targeting a Basel III Tier 1 common ratio of 8% to 8.5%, which is above the regulatory minimum of 7% to provide a buffer for economic uncertainty. We currently estimate that our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio should be in an operating range of 8% to 8.5% during 2013. We have revised our previous forecast to be in our operating range by year-end 2012 due to the strong loan growth we have been experiencing. However, if the rules on sub-investment grade securities are adjusted to be more risk sensitive, we may be able to get to our operating range sooner.","We will have 3 capital priorities for 2012: First, build capital so that we continue to support our clients, grow new relationships and invest in our businesses; second, continue to maintain appropriate capital in light of the uncertainty in the global economic environment; and third, return excess capital to our shareholders. Obviously, we will seek to achieve these priorities and which will be subject to review by our regulators.","Now let's take a look at our outlook for 2012 on Slide 15, which assumes the economic outlook for the year will be a continuation of the current environment. ","As Jim stated earlier, we expect full year PNC stand-alone financial results will improve in 2012 and RBC Bank will be accretive in 2012, excluding integration costs. ","So let me give you some of the combined company expectations.","2012 loan growth for legacy PNC is expected to be in the mid- to high-single digits -- yes, mid- to high-single digits. When RBC Bank\u2019s $16 billion loan portfolio is added, we should see loan increases in the mid- to high teens. We are looking for full year revenue growth in the mid- to high-single digits. Net interest income should increase by mid- to high-single digits. Noninterest income should increase by mid-single digits despite further regulatory impacts on debit card interchange fees.","2011 core expenses of $8.7 billion are expected to increase by mid-single digits, reflecting flat to down expenses for PNC stand-alone and 10 months of RBC Bank expenses. ","Let me explain. 2011 expenses were $9.1 billion. If you back out the unusual fourth quarter charges for mortgage foreclosure costs and the TPS redemption, 2011 core PNC expenses were $8.7 billion. After adding RBC expenses of $600 million, core 2012 expenses will increase by mid-single digits over 2011. Of course, this is apart from any legal and regulatory-related contingencies, noncash charges on further TPS redemptions and RBC Bank integration expenses. And we believe our provision will remain stable in 2012 versus 2011. This forecast gives us confidence that 2012 will be a strong year for PNC.","And with that, I'll hand it back to Jim.","James E. Rohr","Thank you very much, Rick. In spite of a couple of unusual items in the fourth quarter, 2011 was a solid year for PNC. We continue to grow customers and loans, we manage the challenges of the current operating and risk environment and with the pending acquisition of RBC Bank, we're well positioned for future growth. PNC's management team continues to deliver on its promises to customers, employees, communities and shareholders. Taken together, we have positive expectations as well for 2012. ","And with that, I'll be pleased to answer your questions. Operator, if you'd give our participants the instructions, please? Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Foran from Nomura.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I guess given the change in the way the guidance is -- prior quarter was legacy PNC, and the current quarter now the guidance is combined, even qualitatively is it just possible to give us a sense for apples-to-apples where things -- the guidance is better for 2012 for legacy PNC and where it might be worse?","Richard J. Johnson","You know, the net interest income guidance is basically the same as we gave you before embedded in that. We believe that'll be essentially flat year-over-year. We believe fee income will be up despite the regulatory impact. We expect that credit costs will improve, but we're going to incur probably additional credit costs with RBC. That's why we're saying stable. And then on the expense side, clearly, if you back out some of the adjustments we had in the fourth quarter, we're pretty comfortable that we're going to manage those expenses flat to down year-over-year. That's that $8.7 billion number and -- but again I do want to qualify that to the extent that we could have further redemptions of trust preferred securities and we could have further -- potentially further litigation and other regulatory charges that we can't anticipate at the moment.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, and then I guess not the biggest issue in the world for you, but just given the increase in government-guaranteed loans that are delinquent on the balance sheet and a lot of them being FHA mortgages, FHA and VA mortgages, I mean I guess on the one hand most of this stuff was underwritten post the crisis so hopefully the underwriting\u2019s better. But on the other hand, the government hasn't been a great counterparty for the banks this cycle. So what risk, if any, do you see of potential problems or losses emerging from government-guaranteed loans?","James E. Rohr","Well, we don't -- obviously, we would reserve for some if we perceived that there was additional risk in that portfolio. So obviously, the FHA can change their minds about things, but we would expect that these -- they would live up to their government guarantee.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Rick, did you give an outlook for purchase accounting accretion in 2012? I'm not sure if I missed it or if you weren't that specific.","Richard J. Johnson","No, I didn't, John. Reason being is we're pretty confident what we think the PNC stand-alone decline is going to be, which is probably about $0.5 billion year-over-year. But remember, when we do RBC, we're going to pick up some purchase accounting accretion with that transaction, so there's an estimate embedded in there. But we're not going to know until we close and get a look at the valuation on the books and all that and we'll have a better idea of that. But I'm very comfortable with the overall net interest income guidance that I gave for the combined company as well as the fact that I think PNC stand-alone will be flat year-over-year. And the reason for that, John, is even though there's a $0.5 billion decline in purchase accounting accretion, the way we are growing core net interest income, because of the reduction in funding costs and the increase in loans, is going to make up for that full decline in purchase accounting accretion from 2011 to 2012.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And could you remind us what are the integration costs you expect to take in 2012 related to RBC?","Richard J. Johnson","Yes, it's about $300 million in total. It's $170 million in the first quarter.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Do you happen to have an estimate of how much Tier 1 common the RBC acquisition cost you, or what that does to your capital ratios as it comes out of the first quarter?","Richard J. Johnson","Yes, I would look at that as 1 point. Given we're not issuing any equity related to the transaction, it would probably -- I estimate it'll drop our Tier 1 common ratio by 1 percentage point. That's a combination of the goodwill we'll record as well as the new risk-weighted assets we'll put on our balance sheet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question is on your potential appetite for M&A. Clearly, you have been in the headlines of late and I was wondering, Jim, if you could remind us as you look to integrate the RBC deal, what your plans are for M&A and generally building your Southeast franchise over the next 12 to 24 months.","James E. Rohr","That's a great question and we really look at the RBC franchise as a great opportunity. As you know, we're acquiring RBC at a discount to tangible book with a negative premium on deposits. And to a great extent, it's positioning us very well across the franchise and we don't think that we have to do a great deal of acquisition at all in order to fill out what we think is a good branch franchise with the exception of just hiring people. And I'll give you an example. In Atlanta where the expectation was that we might need 100 branches in Atlanta, because of the decline in utilization of branches, 100 would probably suffice. That was our number as well as RBC's. Well, we'll get 55 with the RBC transaction, we acquired 27 with the Flagstar and so we're basically there already. We'll build a number of them in the right locations. So we really don't have to do a lot of additional acquisitions to build out the RBC franchise in the Southeast. So I think you'll see us be very judicious in terms of considering acquisitions in the future. If there's something remarkably cheap that fits our risk profile and is wonderfully accretive that you would be very happy with ","[Audio Gap] ","now, I think we're particularly focused on just executing around the RBC transaction.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, and I just wanted to ask a follow-up question on the CD repricing that you mentioned that will occur in the first half of the year. The 2.5% rate that you gave us, is that the effective rate, taking into account any purchase accounting discount? So if we're doing the math, is it 2.5 to 33 basis points on the $750 billion that you wish to retain or is the effective rate already lower than 2.5%?","Richard J. Johnson","No, the 2.5% is the actual rate of the CD itself. It is not adjusted for purchase accounting. The adjustment for purchase accounting is why the purchase accounting is coming down year-over-year. So that's embedded in that $500 million I spoke about. This is the contractual rate and these will be repriced under 33. But what I would say is the benefit we're getting from the repricing here given rates have dropped so dramatically is much greater than the runoff of the purchase accounting related to these deposits.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And my last question is just a follow-up to John's question. The net interest income guidance is mid- to high-single digits, it includes that runoff in that CD purchase accounting benefit and includes some estimate of purchase accounting from RBC?","Richard J. Johnson","That's correct.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","There's been a lot of talk about banks purchasing some loans from, in part, foreign banks looking to deleverage. And I'm just wondering what your appetite is in that area and what specific areas you might target.","James E. Rohr","Well, we've been interested in doing that, as you know. With an 85% loan-to-deposit ratio and interest rates being so low, clearly we would have an appetite for that. We\u2019ve bought a few things, I would say modest. What we've found is that most of the things being offered are either bid -- are plain vanilla assets that are bid to a point where the return on risk is not attractive or they're just items that we wouldn't be particularly interested in. So there are some opportunities. I think there\u2019s going to continue to be more opportunities in the future as a number of these things appear to be surfacing at an increasing pace. And so I think there'll be opportunities for us to buy things at good yields. So far our purchase activity has been modest, but I would guess it would increase.","Richard J. Johnson","And I think, Matt, we're also focused on where we can get the customers and actually grow the business from there as well, so both of those will be important to us.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just coming back to the pending RBC deal, can you just remind us, I think on the fee revenue side, you've talked about some low-hanging fruit. How quickly does that come onto the revenue platform? And then the cost savings, remind us how much and the timing of that?","James E. Rohr","The low-hanging fruit, I think, is across-the-board. I mean this is really a retail franchise. It was a franchise that was put together by the Royal community banks primarily and then they were all placed on a community bank platform. And as a result, they had a retail community bank product set. When we acquire them in the first week of March, we will convert the entire franchise that weekend. And so all of the electronic products that we have, Virtual Wallet, Wealth Insights, myCFO will all be available to them and those are products that they have not had at all. So I think there'll be a terrific uptick in that space. Also we're in the process of hiring C&IB personnel. I think we're -- we have identified a regional president for all but one of the markets. Some of them are RBC folks, some of them are PNC people that will be moving. And so I think the C&IB opportunity will get underway rather quickly because I think the calling effort will be beginning prior to the closing. So I think you'll see an uptick in business coming out of the Southeast right off the bat.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, and the cost savings side then, too?","James E. Rohr","On the cost side, we said we would take out I believe $230 million and...","Richard J. Johnson","Yes, and $150 million of that will be this year.","James E. Rohr","$150 million of that will be the first year. A lot of the $150 million will be front-ended. As we do the conversion, the payments to the Royal for processing will stop so that's a big part of the cost saves that'll start in the second quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.","Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","My main question was already asked, but I just wanted to make sure I was clear on the guidance for noninterest expense. You're starting with the $8.7 billion and you're saying that, that number mostly due to flat or down expenses at legacy PNC plus expenses at RBC will cause a full year '12 number to be up mid-single digits from that $8.7 billion, is that correct?","Richard J. Johnson","You got it, Ed. Exactly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","My question relates to the $240 million residential mortgage foreclosure expenses, and can you just elaborate that more. That's a higher number than we expected. Is that related to either the robo-signing litigation or is this related to the SEC consent letter? Can you just give us some background to this?","James E. Rohr","I wish I could, but unfortunately this is a governmental relations matter. We've talked to a number of regulators. And most recently, we've been contacted by additional regulators who gave us some information that we believe that we needed to accrue for in the fourth quarter. We accrued for it as best we know how. And I think that, that's about all I can say about the discussion. The 2 items that the accountants always say is something probable or estimable. We believe that there was something that was going to come from the mortgage arena in the servicing side, but we didn't -- we never could figure out how to estimate it. But the additional -- the recent conversations we had gave us some additional information, which we accrued for in the quarter.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I mean when you talk about the additional regulator, is that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau?","James E. Rohr","I think we just have to say the additional regulators. We're restricted in discussing our relationship with our regulators.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, I mean -- yes, okay. It's just a confusing number because usually, is this a litigation expense. So this is the regulators coming to you and your accountant saying that you got to have a better handle on what these future expenses are going to be basically. That's what this number is?","James E. Rohr","Yes.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just maybe that kind of 3-stage priorities on capital management, could you maybe amplify that a little bit? I mean you did say that the RBC deal would cause a 100 basis point reduction, is that the amount that you would be expected to kind of recapture before starting capital management? Or is it a different number? I mean how should we think about that?","James E. Rohr","I think the capital management issues are really we would like to invest in our customers first. The loan growth side, I think, is very pleasing indeed. I mean the idea that we were able to grow loans 12% in the fourth quarter, if that kind of loan growth continues, I think we would both be very, very happy that we will be using our capital for that. I would guess the -- from my guess, M&A -- the utilization of capital for M&A is probably very limited and so we would look to support our customers and then we would look to return any excess capital. We would need to build capital, obviously, to get to the Basel numbers that we talked about. Rick mentioned that we expect to be in our range, 8% to 8.5%, sometime in '13. If we get some more reasonable interpretations of how they apply capital to the sub-investment grade securities, I think we would be there much earlier. And then -- and obviously in that would be a consideration of whether increases in dividend or share buyback would be appropriate during that time as well. So we look at all 3 of those things and obviously the regulators look at them as well, as well as our board.","Richard J. Johnson","And then to your question, specifically, the RBC has been in our numbers for a couple of quarters, so that's nothing new.","James E. Rohr","That's right. The RBC -- I mean in all of our forecasts that we give to the regulators as well as our own include the RBC transaction.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Couple of questions. Just Rick, going back to the expenses in the outlook. You mentioned in this particular quarter foreclosure-related matters, I think, for the year have now exceeded $300 million. I'm just curious, your assumption for next year kind of the flat legacy PNC, how should we think about, again, kind of this tough regulatory environment, ever going changes, what gives you that confidence that the legal regulatory matters won't continue to increase? Or said another way, how should we think about how much is embedded within that expense guidance on the regulatory mortgage-related matters?","Richard J. Johnson","Well, we\u2019ve had these costs in each of the quarters through the year. What's unusual is the increase in that in the fourth quarter. I expect we'll continue to have costs similar to what we've seen in previous quarters. I don't expect to have items as large as we've incurred in this quarter. I don't expect that. Now that's still possible. It could occur. But I think at least for the moment, we think at least with what we know we've estimated and accrued for what we think this will cost us, but there's always a risk that we'll get more information that will change that estimate. But I think we're going to have some costs as we go into the next year and I would say that right now I've estimated that more consistent with what you saw in the first 3 quarters.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just to again remind us, just on the funding side, the outlook was roughly $550 million, I think, for the year in terms of cost saves. Was that inclusive of the RBC cost savings expectation, just as a reminder?","James E. Rohr","Yes, it was.","Richard J. Johnson","Yes, it was.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, just last...","James E. Rohr","There's $150 million coming from RBC in the first year and so another $80 million would come in '13.","Richard J. Johnson","And $400 million from PNC.","James E. Rohr","$400 million from PNC.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Right, got you. And then just finally, just in terms of Durbin, again the outlook very positive in terms of the fee income for 2012. Could you just talk a little bit in terms of you had the impact this quarter on Durbin, how do we think about kind of the mitigation efforts and how you're thinking about overcome that shortfall in the coming year, again thinking in terms of kind of legacy PNC?","James E. Rohr","I think the -- obviously, we have a $75 million impact in the quarter. There will be -- when you look at '12, there will be an additional $175 million that we didn't incur this year. That will be partially offset by the fact that we're growing that business rather dramatically in terms of new customers so the net impact of the debit interchange won't look like $175 million additional next year because of the additional volume coming through the customers. The real issue for the whole consumer bank is that we have to reprice our relationships with the consumers. And as you've seen, we came out with a new product set in March of this year. We've grown 300,000 households, including 40,000 with acquisition. But 260,000 households that we grew over the course of the year is a really remarkable process. I think we just have to keep repricing our products and looking at products and services and also bringing down the cost to serve. So I think it's not a case -- I think some people have learned that you just don't say, okay, we'll make it up with one new fee. I think you just have to look at the whole consumer relation. To be honest about it, if interest rates were at 5%, we were making a lot of money on the deposits that we have with the consumer, it wouldn't be quite the issue that it is. But clearly, with interest rates being so low, obviously you have to use different types of pricing, including different kinds of fees in order to make the relationship more profitable.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","Question for you, Rick. I think you gave the cost of funds in the fourth quarter as 42 bps, is that correct?","Richard J. Johnson","I think that's correct, Nancy, yes.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","Yes, Wells Fargo gave their cost of funds, I think yesterday, at about 22 bps and I am assuming that, that's probably the lower end of your peer group. Can you tell me where the 42 bps sort of lies within the peer group and how much lower you guys can or want to go?","Richard J. Johnson","Well, a lot of it's going to be the repricing of the CDs that you're going to continue to see in 2012, which is going to lead to a reduction in funding costs of almost $175 million in 2012 and $275 million going into '13. Now some of that'll be offset by purchase accounting coming down and the benefit there. But overall, that'll drive that rate down lower. So right now, we're probably a little bit inflated given we have a lot of these CDs still to reprice.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","Do you guys have -- I mean, do you want to stay sort of in the middle of the pack in terms of deposit pricing or sort of what is the philosophy of deposit pricing right now?","James E. Rohr","Deposit pricing, I think when you think about what the opportunity for the deposits are, we've been running off high-cost CDs. You can see it easily in the balance sheet. We've been growing customers and growing transaction accounts dramatically. So I think we're really looking at growing transaction accounts and growing time deposits in this interest rate environment is really not a very attractive endeavor. We do it on a relationship basis, not on a hot lending basis.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","And secondly, I believe you mentioned that there might be further TruP redemptions this year. Can you just remind us where you stand in TruPS still on the balance sheet at this point and what the triggering event or what the thought process about future redemptions might be?","Richard J. Johnson","Well, we -- after -- obviously, we redeemed $750 million in the fourth quarter. We have about $1.5 billion of redemptions primarily in the second, third and fourth quarters of this year and the average rates on those are between about 6.5% to 12%. So I think with each one of them we'll have to see where rates are and make an economic call at that decision as to whether it's appropriate to refinance it. And obviously at 12%, I think it's highly likely. At 6%, maybe it's a little bit more of a question mark. So we've going to have to see where rates are at that time.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ian Foley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","It's actually Ian Foley for Ken. Quick question on security deals. They've generally hung in better than expected. We're wondering if you could give some color on what the new go-to rates are and what, if any, your investment strategy has changed given the current rate environment.","James E. Rohr","Well, we remain very, very short in terms of the current rate environment. I mean we've spent a lot of time building capital and we're not about to give it away in a bond trade. So we'll remain very short in the securities book for the time being.","Ian Foley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got you, okay. And then just a general housekeeping question. Did you guys take an impairment on the commercial mortgage servicing rate this quarter? I think you had given that number in the past, but I couldn\u2019t find it in the earnings release.","Richard J. Johnson","It's less than $10 million, a pretty small number.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I'm going to start with the -- put you on the defense a little bit, I think. If I take out those first 2 charges, then your earnings go up to $1.39 and that's $0.02 above consensus. But then if you take out the tax rate impact, you now go down to $1.31 which would be $0.06 below consensus. So you sound as though you're pretty positive and you thought it was a good quarter, but how do you help reconcile the $1.31 that I get with consensus of $1.37 or are there other noise or onetime charges or am I missing something?","Richard J. Johnson","Well, you have a couple of things. One is -- I assume what you meant is that we're getting the benefit because of the lower tax -- effective tax rate, correct, Mike?","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Right.","Richard J. Johnson","Yes, well, a lot of the reason for the lower effective tax rate is because of the lower earnings, which obviously the tax credits don't go as far, and so that's part of the effect. They go further, I should say, against the lower earnings. The other thing that we're missing here is if you look at the personnel line. Clearly, we've had $100 million increase in that line. A lot of that is just simply driven by stock market prices and PNC stock price where was at a very low point at the end of September and obviously a lot of improvement by the end of December. And a lot of that number, at least the majority of that number, is driven by the change in stock market prices. So unless the markets go up, which is a good thing, we don't expect to have those costs in the future, and that's over half of that. So I think that's something which isn't necessarily repeatable.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's clear from what...","Richard J. Johnson","And if it doesn't repeat, it's a good thing.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I don't understand that though. In other words, this is your fifth bullet point in your press release: Increase from personnel expense of $103 million dollars primarily driven by higher stock market prices and higher business production. So higher business production you're simply paying more incentive comp, I understand that. But how do higher stock market prices increase personnel expense?","Richard J. Johnson","Well, we have a lot of stock-based plans, which are based upon performance and so the expense is variable in some cases. So to the extent that the market goes up, the value of that stock goes up and that's an expense impact when that occurs. And these would be those that have been awarded in the past year or in prior years.","James E. Rohr","We've moved away from options in the recent years and moved towards performance-based restricted shares. And so the accounting on an option would be fully accrued at the beginning. It's not the same accounting treatment for the performance shares.","Richard J. Johnson","And the other impact, Mike, is on deferred compensation where obviously the stock market prices go up and that hasn't increased in the cost to us of that deferred comp. Now, we hedge some of that through other income and you see that on the other side in the revenue.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And you also had some integration charges of $0.03, is that correct?","Richard J. Johnson","That's correct, yes. We were not getting -- absolutely. I can give you a whole list of things probably. We had some -- you look at the occupancy and equipment, we had some facility write-offs in the quarter related to one of our buildings in one of our markets, which was about $16 million to $18 million. Wrote off some software pretax. We've wrote off some software and some other items as well. So there's a whole litany of things in the expense line, Mike. That's kind of where I'm leaning back and saying, I'm very confident we've been through the first quarter and obviously I've got to qualify everything I say as subject to, subject to and subject to. The first quarter expenses will be very close to what we reported in the third quarter of 2011.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. Can I ask a separate question? Commercial loan growth, what was the change in loan utilization? And is the loan growth coming from increased borrower demand or from market share?","James E. Rohr","The majority of it came -- we did not have a meaningful increase in the utilization rate. And so we had loan growth. You could see it in the chart across-the-board in terms of industries and across-the-board in terms of markets. And I think that actually is the reason we're a little bullish on loan growth going into '12 because it wasn't one segment. It wasn't one market or one region. It was really across-the-board, diversified growth in all of the various loan categories. So we were very pleased about that.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And so you're bullish on PNC's loan growth, not necessarily the industry's loan growth because -- why -- how are you getting this loan growth if demand's not picking up?","James E. Rohr","It appears -- from what I've read, it appears as if loan growth is picking up across the country. But I think our 12% loan growth in the fourth quarter and the supplement that we set out on Page 6, I mean you can see that retail and wholesale was up, manufacturing was up, service providers were up, real estate-related was up, financial services. So we have more activity, healthcare. We had activity, increased activity, in virtually every different segment that we measure. And we really -- I mean, that's very exciting. When we look at the accounting, Mike, obviously housing -- the residential housing is still massively challenged and there's going to be some more challenges for another year or 2 in that space. But the rest of the country is doing better and when you look at the earnings reports that have come out, retail sales, unemployment coming down, the rest of the country is doing better now. It's not great. And it would be nice to have some residential housing because that has all the spinoffs with washers and dryers and refrigerators and the rest. But the national economy is doing better than it was a year ago and I think there's a number of signs that you can point to where we're making a comeback.","Richard J. Johnson","And Mike, we probably don't have as many headwinds as we had in the past from the loan growth. The Non-strategic Assets Portfolio is much smaller. The commercial real estate business has hit an inflection point in terms of its ability to grow loans as it's not running down as much the previous loans that were impaired or otherwise having credit problems, so we're not having as much headwind. And I think as a result there, you're seeing some good growth.","James E. Rohr","All right, operator, are there any other questions?","Operator","There are no further questions, sir.","James E. Rohr","All right. Thank you very much. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bryan Gill. Sir, please go ahead.","Bryan Gill","Well, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today\u2019s conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC\u2019s Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO.","Today\u2019s presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information, as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today\u2019s earnings release materials, as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These materials are all available on our corporate website pnc.com under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of October 12, 2018, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bill Demchak.","Bill Demchak","Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. This morning, you would have seen PNC reported third quarter net income of $1.4 billion, or $2.82 per diluted common share. Overall, I thought we delivered another really solid quarter, highlighted by continued progress on our strategic priorities and our key financial metrics, all moving in the right direction.","We grew average loans and deposits and we continue to add new clients. Net interest income increased, NIM expanded and fee income grew. In fact, we hit a record high for fee income through nine months, with increases in basically every category other than residential mortgage.","We continue to manage expenses well with the small increase this quarter reflecting higher business activity. Credit quality also remained strong with nonperformers of net charge-offs down and our tangible book value per share grew again, and we\u2019ve raised the quarterly dividend to $0.95 in August.","And I do want to touch on loan growth for a second, because I know it\u2019s something you were all watching closely. While we did see modest growth in the quarter consistent with industry data, our corporate loan growth came in below our own expectations. We attribute the shortfall to a combination of several factors, including elevated competition, meaningfully higher payoffs this quarter and paydowns and overall lower line utilization.","The higher payoffs and paydowns appear to be driven by competition from non-bank lenders, excess corporate cash and attractive opportunities for our clients in the bond markets. Interestingly, our secured lending businesses, excluding real estate, which collectively comprised roughly a third of our book and faced less competition, they grew at almost 3% this quarter.","Now, while we recognize these challenges, we can impact all of them directly, what we can and are doing is executing upon our Main Street model providing value-added solutions in a world-class service. We continue to add new customers and deepen relationships that meet our risk-adjusted returns.","On the consumer side, I was pleased to see loan growth again this quarter. And while our outlook for fourth quarter loan quarter is up modestly as Rob is going to you review with you a bit later. The economy is really strong, consumers are in great financial shape and companies are optimistic and growing. In addition, recent market disruption may help to alleviate some of the challenges that I outlined a moment ago.","So, we expect to see continued opportunities for loan growth moving forward. To that end, we are experiencing success in our national initiative to expand our middle market corporate banking franchise and faster growing markets. And we also recently launched our national retail digital strategy, leading with a high-yield savings account and offering our virtual wallet checking accounts, which will be supported by an ultra-thin retail network.","In fact, we just opened our first out-of-footprint retail location in Kansas City earlier this week. As we work to expand the reach of our brand, we are excited about how we are positioned to drive growth and efficiency through time. And before I hand it over to Rob, I just want to thank our employees for their continued hard work, as well as our clients for their trust in us.","With that, over to you, Rob.","Rob Reilly","Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As you\u2019ve seen by now, we\u2019ve reported net income of $1.4 billion, or $2.82 per diluted common share. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. Total loans grew approximately $700 million linked-quarter and $4.1 billion compared to the same quarter a year ago.","Investment securities of $80.8 billion increased $3.3 billion, or 4% linked-quarter. Purchases were primarily agency residential mortgage-backed securities and U.S. treasuries.","Our cash balances at the Fed averaged $18.8 billion for the third quarter, down $1.9 billion linked-quarter and $4.6 billion year-over-year. Deposits were up 1% on both the linked-quarter and year-over-year basis.","As of September 30, 2018, our Basel III Common Equity Tier-1 ratio was estimated to be 9.3%, down from 9.5% as of June 30, 2018, reflecting continued capital return to shareholders and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income.","Importantly, we maintained strong capital ratios even as we returned $914 million of capital to shareholders. We repurchased 3.3 million common shares for $469 million and paid dividends of $445 million.","Our return on average assets for the third quarter was 1.47%. Our return on average common equity was 12.32%, and our return on tangible common equity was 15.75%. Our tangible book value was $73.11 per common share as of September 30, an increase of 5% compared to a year ago.","Turning to Slide 5. Average loans were up approximately $700 million linked-quarter and $4.1 billion, or 2% compared to the same quarter last year. Commercial lending balances increased approximately $200 million compared to the second quarter. As Bill mentioned, our pipelines were strong throughout much of the quarter, but payoffs and paydowns were substantial.","Compared to the same quarter a year ago, total commercial lending increased $3 billion and growth was broad-based with the exception of real estate, which declined by $1 billion.","Importantly, we\u2019re seeing momentum in consumer lending. Balances increased by approximately $500 million linked-quarter and $1.1 billion year-over-year. We had growth in our auto, residential mortgage, credit card and unsecured installment loan portfolios, while home equity and education lending continued to decline.","Deposits increased by $3 billion, or 1% compared to the same period a year ago. On a linked-quarter basis, deposits increased $1.5 billion, driven by seasonal growth in commercial deposits.","During the quarter, consumer demand deposits decreased somewhat, reflecting seasonal consumer spending. However, our time deposits increased reflecting higher rates.","As the slide shows, our overall cumulative deposit beta increased in the third quarter to 29%, driven by both commercial and consumer. Within that number, the cumulative commercial beta is near our stated level. However, our cumulative consumer beta is only 15%, compared to a stated level of 37%. Increases in our overall betas, which we expect to continue will primarily be driven by the consumer side going forward.","As you can see on Slide 6, net income in the third quarter was $1.4 billion. Revenue was up 1% linked-quarter, driven by growth in both net interest income and fee income. Noninterest expense increased 1% compared to the second quarter, reflecting higher business activity. Provision for credit losses in the third quarter increased slightly to $88 million dollars, as overall credit quality remained strong.","Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 15.7%, and this was a result of the timing of certain tax benefits that this year mostly occurred in the third quarter. You\u2019ll recall our tax rate in the second quarter was somewhat elevated at 18.3%. So when combined and viewed on a year-to-date basis, our effective tax rate year-to-date was 17%, consistent with our guidance and expectation for full-year 2018.","Now, let\u2019s discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to Slide 7. Total revenue grew 1% linked-quarter and 6% year-over-year. Net interest income increased $53 million, or 2% linked-quarter and $121 million, or 5% compared to the same period last year, as higher earning asset yields and balances were partially offset by higher funding costs. The linked-quarter comparison also benefitted from an additional day in the third quarter.","Net interest margin was 2.99%, an increase of 3 basis points compared to the second quarter. Noninterest income decreased 1% linked-quarter and increased 6% year-over-year. Importantly, fee income grew 1% linked-quarter and 8% compared to the same quarter last year. It\u2019s also worth noting that our fee income on a year-to-date basis was a record setting $4.7 billion, with increases in every category except for residential mortgage.","The main drivers of the linked-quarter fee increases were: asset management fees, which include our earnings from our equity investment in BlackRock increased $30 million or 7%, reflecting higher average equity markets. Discretionary assets under management increased $10 billion in the quarter.","Service charges on deposits increased $17 million, or 10%, reflecting a seasonal increase in consumer spending. Corporate services fees declined $22 million, primarily due to a lower benefit from commercial mortgage servicing rights and lower loan syndication fees, partially offset by higher M&A advisory fees. Notably, Harris Williams had another record quarter.","Finally, other noninterest income of $301 million decreased $33 million linked-quarter. Visa derivative fair value adjustments were negative in the third quarter and positive in the second quarter, resulting in a change of $59 million. This was partially offset by higher private equity investments.","Going forward, we continue to expect the quarterly run rate for other noninterest income to be in the range of $225 million and $275 million, excluding net securities and Visa activity.","Turning to Slide 8. Third quarter expenses increased by $24 million, or 1% linked-quarter. Personnel expense increased $57 million linked-quarter, largely as a result of incentive compensation expenses, related to business activities and an additional day in the quarter. Importantly, every other expense category declined quarter-over-quarter.","Compared to the same period a year ago, expenses increased $152 million. Personnel expense grew $127 million year-over-year, reflecting revenue growth, higher staffing levels to support business investments and the increase in the minimum hourly wage commitments we made to our employees at the beginning of the year. Additionally, marketing expense increased to support business growth, including our digital expansion efforts.","Our efficiency ratio was 60% in the third quarter, unchanged on both the linked-quarter and a year-over-year basis. As you know, we have a goal to reduce cost by $250 million in 2018 through our continuous improvement program, and we are confident we will fully achieve our full-year target.","Our credit quality metrics are presented on Slide 9 and remain strong. Compared to the second quarter, total nonperforming loans were down $25 million, or 1%. Total delinquencies were up $67 million, or 5%, and included higher auto loan delinquencies in the 30-day to 59-day bucket, related to the impact of Hurricane Florence.","Provision for credit losses of $88 million increased by $8 million linked-quarter, reflecting a higher consumer provision, primarily due to credit card and auto loan growth. Net charge-off decreased $18 million compared to the second quarter. In the third quarter, the annualized net charge-off ratio was 16 basis points, down 4 basis points linked-quarter.","In summary, PNC posted strong third quarter results. During the fourth quarter, we expect continued steady growth in GDP, and we expect one more 25 basis point increase in short-term interest rates in December.","Looking ahead to fourth quarter 2018 compared to third quarter 2018 reported results, we expect loans to be up modestly. We expect both total net interest income and fee income to be up low single digits. We expect other noninterest income to be in the $225 million to $275 million range. We expect expenses to be up low single digits, and we expect provision to be between $100 million and $150 million.","And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question on the phone line comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Scott Siefers","Good morning, guys.","Bill Demchak","Hi, Scott.","Scott Siefers","Okay. First question just on loan growth. The guide for the fourth quarter is consistent with the guide for the third quarter. Just curious if you could give us a sense for overall trajectory. Should we be expecting it to be same level, maybe a little better and why?","And then, I guess, Bill, just as you look at the numerous factors that seem to be impacting growth for you guys in the industry, given where we are in the cycle, what would it take for loan growth that banks like PNC to be able to reaccelerate towards something that you would expect would be more normal, given the strength of the economy?","Bill Demchak","All good questions. So our guidance for the fourth quarter we are seeing up modestly. I would tell you that our forecast as it sits today is up a little bit over the growth rate that we had in the third quarter, so a little bit better. But I would also say that we were surprised by the third quarter.","Our actual production and new clients were pretty good. We saw - against that though, we saw this broad-based utilization drop and we saw lot of paydowns that we hadn\u2019t expected. So I don\u2019t know how to forecast for that. I look at some of this disruption and some of the value lost in corporate bond funds, and I think will - maybe that will slow some of that down, but I don\u2019t know, which is why we put the forecast out that we did.","As I think forward and you say, what should trigger growth here? As we talk to companies, they are really bullish and they are investing, and we see CapEx expenditures going up. And so you would think, it would follow through in loan growth.","Against that, we\u2019ve seen preponderance, I\u2019ve seen all these charts of just the volume of non-investment grade borrowing and even the volume of BBB inside of investment-grade and then the size of the corporate bond markets, all of which are playing against banks as sort of the shadow banking system has taken a lot of volumes.","So, I would like to think that it would change for the better, but we have some structural changes in the market, I think, that we saw play out in the third quarter that, at least, in the near-term are impacting us.","Scott Siefers","Okay. All right, I appreciate that color. And then, Rob, if I could switch for one second to the deposit side, total deposit growth still fine, but a little bit of a mix shift as you would expect in our rising rate environment.","Rob Reilly","Yes.","Scott Siefers","I think in your prepared comments, you had made some note about demand deposits being down seasonally. What would be your best guess for how the mix of the overall deposit book trajectory as we go forward?","Rob Reilly","I would expect to be between the interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing.","Scott Siefers","Yes. I think - sorry, I thought your comment was on demand deposits, but I could be wrong.","Rob Reilly","Yes, I just - just the way I do and then you tell me if this answers your question in terms of the consumer and the commercial side. On the consumer side, we are seeing a shift in savings, which we\u2019ve seen for sometime, and now the beginnings of time deposits, which is natural in what you would expect. And then on the commercial side, we are seeing somewhat of a shift from noninterest-bearing to interest bearing. Again, all reflective of a higher rate environment.","Scott Siefers","Yes. Okay. All right, that sounds good. I appreciate the color.","Bill Demchak","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Bill Demchak","Good morning.","Rob Reilly","Good morning, John.","John Pancari","On the expense side, just given the - some of the pressures on balance sheet trends, particularly on the loan side that you just discussed. Any thought as you are looking at the expense side of the equation to get more constructive on the CIP goals, as you - particularly as you look through the rest of this year and more importantly into 2019?","Rob Reilly","So - hey, John, this is Rob. So, on expenses in the quarter - in the linked-quarter, we did well. Virtually all of the increase in the linked-quarter was in personnel and all of that was essentially incentive compensation related to the higher business activity level. Every other category went down linked-quarter and part of that reflects our CIP effort.","When you drop back and take a look at our expenses year-to-date, that tells sort of the broader story. And if you look at our expenses year-to-date, we\u2019re up $382 million so far this year over 2017. And of that 382 million, 80% of that or 300 million of that is in personnel.","So the other categories are good. Occupancy is down, equipment expense, all other are in line and marketing expense is part of our investment, but that\u2019s a smaller number. But back to that personnel number, that $300 million, about half of that in a typical year is what you would expect to see, half of that is merit and promotion, as well as incentive compensation, which as I pointed out earlier, is a little higher this year, which is a good thing.","The other half of that, the other $150 million really reflects investments that we\u2019ve made that - we make investments every year. But in 2018, they are particularly strong, and they represent higher headcount to support our technology, build out our physical geographic expansion in corporate banking and our digital expansion in consumer banking, as well as the commitment we made to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, minimum pay to $15 an hour.","So that part, that $150 million of the $300 million reflects investments and like all investments, where we fund in that and we expect to see return on that through time. Obviously, the technology investments, we\u2019ll talk about a little bit more. On the raise to the $15 an hour, we\u2019re already seeing lower attrition rates that we would expect will continue. So that - that\u2019s all deliberate and all factored in, and our expense discipline and our program is on track.","John Pancari","Got it.","Bill Demchak","I mean, the quick answer, John, we focus on expenses everyday and try to find ways to knock them down. At the same time, as you look at the changes that are happening in the banking industry is kind of digital takes over and the need to produce product and serve clients in that space would be a real mistake in my view to slowdown and stop our investments.","I like the idea of self-funding in which we\u2019ve largely been able to do. But I don\u2019t want to cap off our growth rate, because we see one quarter of slower loan growth. That\u2019s not the right answer.","John Pancari","Got it. All right. Thanks, Bill. And then separately, on the capital side, sitting here at about a combined payout ratio of about 75%. You\u2019ve alluded to the potential to increase that given - you might have been a bit too conservative as we look to this past CCAR. Could you give us your updated thoughts there? And your peers are around 150% combined payout. How do you - where do you think you could go here as you look forward? Thanks.","Bill Demchak","Well, without getting specifically into payoff, as I said at a recent conference, we did realize we went in a little bit light. There are a couple of reasons why it made sense for us to go back to the Fed and resubmit. We are in conversations with the Fed at this point. Beyond that I don\u2019t have any more detail to give.","On a longer-term, I like the idea of 100% payout. We, on our base case, CCAR always tend to kind of get there. And then, we tend to out-earn our CCAR case, largely because of some of the assumptions you have to put in on loan loss provision and some other things.","So we always struggle with this notion that we try to get to 100%, maybe we have to budget for over 100% to solve back to 100%. But we\u2019re not holding back from capital return at this point and our goal wouldn\u2019t be, too.","John Pancari","Got it. Thanks, Bill.","Bill Demchak","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","John McDonald","Hi, good morning. Rob. I was wondering on - based on the some of the recent regulatory dialogue, it seems that you could potentially see the benefit from EC liquidity rules. Just if that happened, could your remind us how mechanically an EC or LCR rule would allow you to perhaps do some things on the balance sheet you can\u2019t do now? And is there anyway for us to think about the magnitude of that benefit?","Rob Reilly","Yes. Hey, good morning, John. We\u2019ve spoken about this all year, and we are optimistic that something favorable will occur. The - I think, the easiest way, there\u2019s a lot of options, the easiest way, obviously, would to be take a look at the $19 billion that we have on deposit at the Fed. We would, in simple terms, be able to pay down debt or liabilities.","In other instances, we\u2019d be able to redeploy in the higher-yield securities. I think that the conservative rule would be to establish what level of liquidity you need and then just reduce the debt - short-term debt accordingly.","John McDonald","Okay. And I guess, in this environment, you wish you had more things to do with your current liquidity. So just kind of add, I guess, to more of that?","Rob Reilly","Yes, that\u2019s right.","John McDonald","Okay. And you guys have obviously talked about different ways you\u2019re taking PNC on the road into new markets. I wanted to kind of ask the opposite question, when a big player like Bank of America comes into your hometown, how do you think about incremental competitive threats and ensure that you\u2019re maintaining your position in branding as a market leader? And with digital and mobile, are you able to compete a little more on non-price factors these days?","Rob Reilly","Well, that\u2019s - so that\u2019s the dynamic that\u2019s playing out. This is Rob. Bill may want to add some color. This - that\u2019s the dynamic that\u2019s playing out. We\u2019re excited about the initiatives that we are going out-of-footprint on the digitally-led offering, which we can talk a little bit more about. In regard to other providers coming into our sort of legacy markets, we fully expect that, that will occur. We can\u2019t control that.","Bill Demchak","We compete with them everywhere already other than maybe Pittsburgh. And I would tell you in our own experience, where we go into a market dominated by somebody else and we are the underdog. The growth rate always tends to surprise me largely, I think, because there\u2019s some percentage of the population for whatever reason that wants to try a different bank. And I suspect if somebody comes into Pittsburgh, they\u2019ll pick up some amount of that. We have 60% market share or something in Pittsburgh, and there\u2019s 40% left to go around without really major bank presence sitting here. So I suspect, they\u2019ll do fine.","John McDonald","Okay, thanks.","Rob Reilly","Not - but not necessarily with our customers.","Bill Demchak","Yes.","Rob Reilly","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Hey, good morning.","Bill Demchak","Good morning, Betsy.","Rob Reilly","Good morning.","Betsy Graseck","Two questions. One, just one more on expenses. So up a little bit this quarter, or partly a function of the marketing and the investments that you\u2019re doing. I think, it\u2019s related to the digital banking. I\u2019m just wondering how much of that persists from here? Because you\u2019ve got that start-up costs and then you\u2019ve got ongoing marketing. So should we expect that some of that fades as start-up is done, or maybe you could talk through that a little bit?","Bill Demchak","You\u2019re going to have some offsetting things. We didn\u2019t kick off the digital program until late in the third quarter. Having said that, the third quarter, I think, was probably the first full quarter we had the total impact of the $15 raise increase. So there\u2019s a whole bunch of moving pieces in there between personnel and what we\u2019ll do in marketing. And all of that\u2019s embedded in Rob\u2019s script.","Rob Reilly","Yes, I think, and for the fourth quarter guidance actually, the most notable item is that our marketing expense will increase in the fourth quarter. Typically, that hasn\u2019t happened, and that marketing is largely directed towards the digital initiatives.","Betsy Graseck","And then could you talk a little bit about the branch rationalization that you\u2019re doing in your core - your legacy markets. Is there run rate? Is that run rate going to persist at current kind of levels, or is there more to do there, or you almost done, just give us a sense on that side of the equation?","Rob Reilly","Yes. We\u2019re pretty steady there, Betsy. And on our plan for the year, we\u2019ve been averaging about 100 consolidations a year and this year, we\u2019re on track to do a comparable number. So that\u2019s the current path, and I\u2019d expect that to continue.","Bill Demchak","Yes. Part of the issue with accelerating that is the amount of time and effort we put into preparing customers for a branch to close. So, what\u2019s very important is that we retain the balances and the customers as we consolidate a branch. We spend a lot of time on that.","And I\u2019m not sure as a practical matter that we could actually do more or substantially more than that - than the 100 a year we\u2019re currently doing. And we\u2019ll continue to go kind of at that run rate until and if the market tells us based on client attrition that we need to slowdown.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. Okay. Now that\u2019s helpful. And then just lastly on the mortgage side. I know you did a lot in improving the efficiency of that platform over the last couple of years. Could you just tell us strategically how you positioned? And is there - have you created some operating leverage for yourself as you build out into some of these new markets?","Bill Demchak","Well, we\u2019re finally seeing the costs come down in terms of sort of duplicative personnel as we are running two systems. We still at the last leg of bringing home equity origination on to that platform. With that, we will have an effect digital origination capability and closing capability with home equity in our out-of-footprint market should we choose to offer that, I\u2019m not exactly sure where we are on that yet.","But that\u2019s a dramatic improvement from where we are today, where believe it or not, to close home equity loan at PNC. Today, you\u2019ve got to go into a branch. So all of this system change sort of puts home equity mortgage on the same front and same servicing platform and independent of volumes, which we hope would increase. You\u2019ll see costs continue to bleed out of that system.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Thanks so much.","Bill Demchak","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning.","Rob Reilly","Good morning.","Bill Demchak","Good morning, Erika.","Erika Najarian","Can I ask a little bit, Bill, about the tenor of competition from non-bank? And I\u2019m really most curious about more on the competition with regards to structure. And what you\u2019re observing in terms of competition from private direct middle market lenders?","And then sort of as a follow-up to that, you mentioned structural changes in the market, which I agree with. But I wonder as the Fed continues to dream liquidity out of the system, how much of the opportunity can go back to banks over time?","Bill Demchak","Yes. Again, all good questions. And I guess, what I would say is, we continue to think that the leverage loan market is overheated. I continue to think that as rates rise, it\u2019s going to put real pressure on those credits that are originating lower rate environment and not necessarily hedged against LIBOR going up as much as it does. Eventually, that turns.","Now as it relates to kind of our near-term flow, we don\u2019t really play in the leverage loan market. But that market being as open it is - as it is has caused a number of our private middle market companies that we historically have banked to go to private equity. And while we might keep them as a transaction client TM and so forth, we don\u2019t participate in the financing of that.","So that M&A wave is kind of pulling loam demand often out of the banking system by levering it and putting it into CLOs and so forth. And I do think there\u2019ll be a crack in that at some point as rates continue to rise. And I think, when that happens, you\u2019ll see probably more traditional flows back into the banks. But I just don\u2019t know the timeline in that.","Erika Najarian","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","Hi.","Rob Reilly","Hi, Mike.","Mike Mayo","Well, thanks for your honesty, Bill, in terms of what\u2019s happening with your loan growth than that is tough to forecast. So when you go back to your team at PNC, what kind of message do you want to send? I mean, you could send all sorts of messages, you could be angry, you could be happy, you could accept what\u2019s taking place, or you could pause.","So let me - you could be angry, because you say, \u201cHey, we\u2019re not executing as well as we need to do better\u201d Or you could be happy and say, \u201cYou know, what you\u2019ve seen these cycles before, you see the craze is out there. We\u2019re going to stick to what we do and that\u2019s fine\u201d Or you could - you accept what\u2019s taking place and say, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to get better and have a new expense program or something\u201d Or you could be - or you could pause and say, \u201cYou know what, this is just weird and we\u2019re just going to see what happens over the next couple of quarters\u201d So what message will you be sending to your team?","Bill Demchak","I don\u2019t - Mike, I don\u2019t really have to do any of the above in the following sense. We have - since I\u2019ve been at PNC, followed the same model, the same credit box, the same clients we want to bank are the ones that we bank. And for risk is outside of our box, we just don\u2019t do it, and we can\u2019t control the market. Now what was weird about the third quarter was, we actually originated a lot of business.","So, I\u2019m actually pleased with the activity of our bankers and the number of new clients that we\u2019ve brought on Board. I\u2019m disappointed by the environment in the sense that utilization went down and we had paydowns, but there\u2019s nothing I can do about that. And as a practical matter, we will never be the bank. And by the way, we could be very easily. It simply says, go get loan growth. I can make loan growth whatever you want\u2026","Mike Mayo","Right.","Bill Demchak","\u2026for the next six months or a year or till the cycle cracks and we just don\u2019t do that. We don\u2019t need to do it, given the - our ability to grow fee income in our - on our plan to just - bank use three hours in a cloud of dust and you do it consistently forever and you produce a good franchise, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re after.","Mike Mayo","So do you...","Bill Demchak","Your question on expenses. I get back to this now. So we\u2019re fighting everyday to drop expenses. But having said that, again, we could choose to simply curtail investment in digital. We could choose to curtail investment in cyber. We could choose to not have active data centers in terms of resiliency of our client-facing applications. And in the near-term, that would make our expenses look great, and in the long-term, it would kill us. And I think a lot of our competitors are choosing to do that on expenses and choosing to do that on loans. And that\u2019s just - that\u2019s not who we are.","Mike Mayo","So let me see if I had this straight. So I mean - but I think I hear you\u2019re saying, you\u2019re going to barrel through with your strategy that\u2019s worked for the last several years and the environment will eventually come your way since you\u2019re looking through an entire cycle. Is that paraphrasing it correctly?","Bill Demchak","Well, on credit, yes, right? So you can figure out who is lying or not with respect to loan growth until you have a credit crunch. And you\u2019ve heard me say forever that banks are the only industry in the world where you can live by your cost of goods sold until their downturn. And I always want to be the bank that outperforms in that environment. And that means that we have to, at the margin, slow top line growth by not chasing deals or just don\u2019t hit our return metrics then so be it.","Mike Mayo","All right. And then lastly, the line utilization, is that from some of the borrowers going elsewhere, or what else is just the corporate?","Bill Demchak","That one - what I think that is simply corporates are flush. The lower tax rate has basically increased cash flow in companies. And all else equal, they\u2019re not spending the incremental difference in totality on CapEx. And so they\u2019re dropping their line utilization. I think that\u2026","Rob Reilly","Hey, Mike, this is Rob. I can jump in on that. That\u2019s exactly right, and Bill referenced this in his opening comments. If you take a look at our commercial loans, where the pressure that we\u2019re talking about is most pressing is in that general corporate book. And the two headwinds are cash plus borrowers, which is dropping utilization and that\u2019s a function of lower tax rates, repatriation, all the things you\u2019ve read about and these paydowns and payoffs. Those two items are the headwinds. To the extent, that they abate, which we expect that they might at some point, that - that\u2019s the issue.","Bill Demchak","Yes. And by the way, Mike, our pipeline as it sits today in the forward months, looks great. It looks stronger than it\u2019s looked in the last six months, I think, we\u2019re going to rob the knob. But yes, it does. And - so our only hesitation on this stuff is these\u2026","Rob Reilly","Those headwinds.","Bill Demchak","\u2026out of our - we can get lots of deals that meet our risk criteria in this environment and we\u2019re winning them. What ends up happening is, our existing book of business is borrowing less and\/or disappearing through paydowns either public market or paydowns, because they were taken private. That\u2019s\u2026","Mike Mayo","Great. That\u2026","Bill Demchak","Yes.","Mike Mayo","Yes, that\u2019s helpful.","Bill Demchak","All right. Thanks, Mike.","Mike Mayo","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning, guys.","Bill Demchak","Good morning, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you talk a little bit about the noninterest-bearing deposits? When you look at your levels, which represent about 31% of total interest-bearing liabilities, what do you think in a rising rate environment, that\u2019s going to settle out at - when you think back at PNC, maybe prior to the financial crisis, where those levels were, do we have just as a risk for everybody in a rising rate environment, those deposits tend to fall?","Rob Reilly","Yes, Gerard, I can say that. I mean, obviously, that\u2019s theoretically, we watch it all the time. I would expect the continued shift that\u2019s occurring, that will occur. I don\u2019t - we haven\u2019t really handicapped where it\u2019s going to stop or where it\u2019s going to be, because there\u2019s obviously a lot of variables involved there. But we manage this way before, it\u2019ll be fine either way.","Gerard Cassidy","I see, okay. And then coming back to the competition on commercial lending that you have already addressed. Have you sensed that other competitors with the lower tax rate or maybe competing away some of the lower tax rate. Is there anyway of seeing if that\u2019s happening?","Bill Demchak","For all the talk around that, we actually haven\u2019t seen it. There was some talk early on that we heard from some clients that competitors were maybe doing that at the margin. But practically, that isn\u2019t really what we\u2019re seeing. We\u2019re seeing competition on structure, or seeing deals that should be ABL going cash flow and those kinds of things. But I don\u2019t see people outright sort of rebating tax reform.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay, I see. And just finally, in this whole commercial competitive area that you\u2019ve referenced, is it primarily in the legacy PNC footprint, or you also seeing it in your newer markets that you\u2019ve been expanding into?","Bill Demchak","It\u2019s everywhere. And by the way, that - it\u2019s intuitive, right? If what you\u2019re offering is a commodity, which is money, there\u2019s no special skill involved. There\u2019s no special secured financing or technology, then you\u2019re offering a commodity. And in this market, there\u2019s a lot of competition for that commodity.","Gerard Cassidy","No doubt, no?","Rob Reilly","As a part of your question though is, in our expansion and growth markets, we do see better growth dynamics just because it\u2019s of a smaller base even though those factors are in place there.","Bill Demchak","Yes.","Gerard Cassidy","Gotcha. Okay. Thank you.","Bill Demchak","Yep.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Recently, there has been some talk - talking about banks of your size and the potential. Maybe help us on the regulatory front from either capital or liquidity? And I know you\u2019ve talked - discussed this in the past. But I\u2019m just wondering just where that conversation sits in your mind? And what you\u2019re - at this point hoping for directionally?","Bill Demchak","Well, I think in Governor Quarles last testimony, he spoke to this and talked about\u2026","Rob Reilly","The large 90 since.","Bill Demchak","We have the large 90 since - having something out in the market before the end of the year, and that\u2019s consistent with my own dialogue with the Fed. I\u2019m not exactly sure what they\u2019re going to do. I think, they\u2019re thinking about the notion and we would like to see the notion that you get rid of the step function of 250. Not only as it relates to LCR, but frankly, as it relates to some of the relief you see on the capital to the group\u2019s below 250. The change in the sin bucket items\u2026","Rob Reilly","AOCI.","Bill Demchak","\u2026yes, AOCI and some other things, so we\u2019ll have to see. But I think, there is an inclination amongst the regulators to put more finesse on allowing regulation to fit the size and risk of the firm as opposed to doing a step function off of asset value that they came up with fifteen years ago.","Rob Reilly","Which they call tailoring Ken, yes.","Bill Demchak","Yes.","Ken Usdin","Yes. Okay, got it. So that we\u2019ll wait and see on that. And then just a follow-up on the choices that you have on the mix of the excess cash. Just in term - what are you doing right now in terms of just investment portfolio, obviously, was up at period-end. But in terms of the types of new rates you\u2019re seeing versus what\u2019s rolling off the back book is in the securities book?","Bill Demchak","Yes. So just a couple of things. The securities balances were up quarter-to-quarter, but our actual duration dollars were flat, because we unwound or reduced received fixed swap position. So, it looks like we put a lot on the money to work in the third quarter and we didn\u2019t really. We just moved from synthetic to cash.","That said, particularly with the rate environment, where it\u2019s been for the last couple of weeks, the yield that we\u2019re seeing on income and securities, at this point are largely mortgage-backs and treasuries, are in excess of the portfolio that\u2019s running off. So, there is clear benefit from this going forward.","Ken Usdin","Yes. And Bill, one just follow-up on that. Will you continue to turn it - to continue to move that synthetic to cash just at this point of the rate cycle?. How do you balance just where you stand on asset-sensitivity versus you starting to kind of mortgage it a little bit?","Bill Demchak","We\u2019re still asset-sensitive.","Ken Usdin","For sure.","Bill Demchak","We\u2019re nowhere near done here. The move from synthetic to cash is simply a value trade. Swaps and we put them on, offered a lot more value than they did, so we unwound those and went into securities. We will do that opportunistically. We go back the other way if things change.","So I - that was just a value trade. I think going forward, we will be investing into this market. You\u2019ve heard us say forever, we\u2019re not going to bet on red in one big swoop, but we\u2019ll incrementally and do it in our patience thus far looks like it\u2019s going to pay dividends.","Ken Usdin","Yep. Okay, I understood. Thank you.","Bill Demchak","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Kevin Barker","Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on some of the deposit conversations and question. We\u2019ve seen the period-end noninterest-bearing deposits dropped significantly. And you mentioned part of that was due to business customers. Was there any shift also from the consumer side? And do you expect the rate of change between noninterest-bearing deposit growth and interest-bearing deposit growth to remain the same going into the fourth and first quarters?","Rob Reilly","Hey, Kevin, it\u2019s Rob. To answer your first part of your question. Firstly, all the movement we saw was on the commercial side, so not much in terms of the consumer side. If anything on the consumer side, as I said earlier, it\u2019s more a migration to savings and time deposits, but from already interest-bearing accounts. Going forward, we\u2019ll just have to monitor it. I don\u2019t see anything in terms of a radical step change.","Bill Demchak","One thing that will happen over time is we do accelerate our digital expansion is - the bulk of those new monies will come in the form of interest-bearing.","Rob Reilly","Yes, and that\u2019s growth.","Bill Demchak","Yes, but it\u2019s growth and interest-bearing that would largely outpace, because we\u2019re not bringing into proportional amount of noninterest-bearing at the same time. So it could cause our mix to shift over time.","Rob Reilly","Over time, but not necessarily in the short-term.","Bill Demchak","Yes.","Kevin Barker","Yes. So when I think about the shift to digital, I mean, you already have plenty of liquidity. You are meeting your LCR ratio. Your loan deposit ratio is running in the mid-80s, much better than most of your peers. When I look at the digital offering, are you going to continue to be - are you going to be a price leader here in the beginning just to show that you can grow this deposit and then slow it down?","Bill Demchak","You have to compare it to the alternative and the alternative today is wholesale funding. So it\u2019s a lot cheaper than what we pay in wholesale funding. Even with LCR, if they make LCR changes, our ability to mix shift some of our more expensive wholesale funding into retail, which is beneficial to us. So we\u2019ll continue to be competitive on our digital offering. We have no real cost structure other than advertising behind it. So the margin to it is actually pretty good.","Rob Reilly","And as you know, there is a big qualitative element to it. This is an experiment in terms of the future of banking. So, largely that versus a need for the deposit.","Bill Demchak","Yes. The one thing I would say and it\u2019s really early days in what we\u2019re doing in digital is, we have been pleasantly surprised by the number of clients who choose to open the virtual wallet account, which is a full-service account versus just open the high-yield savings account, which is obviously our dream scenario. We want full-service clients and we have a large percentage of the people out of the gate choosing to be that. My own assumption going in was that, that would take longer frankly to convert these clients, and so that is a good thing.","Kevin Barker","Do you see that starting to generate higher loan growth in the consumer side, particularly in card and auto because of that shift?","Bill Demchak","It\u2019s too early. It\u2019s too early, but anomalous It\u2019s something we are going to track and we are going to have to figure out the right metrics to show you guys, which we will.","Kevin Barker","All right. Thank you for taking my question.","Bill Demchak","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please go ahead.","Brian Klock","Hi, good morning, gentlemen.","Bill Demchak","Good morning.","Brian Klock","Rob, I was wondering if you could give a follow-up a little bit and I apologize if you have answered this already. But on the expense guidance for the fourth quarter, I would like you to talk a little bit about having some of the seasonal marketing expenses that would be in that guidance for the fourth quarter. But are you assuming that the FDIC surcharge is doing that expense for the fourth quarter?","Bill Demchak","Yes.","Rob Reilly","Yes. So in our guidance, we assume not change in the surcharge amount. So there is the potential that we don\u2019t have that expense. And if that\u2019s the case, that would be a good thing, but it\u2019s not part of our guidance.","Brian Klock","And if I understand correctly, even if it\u2019s still there for the fourth quarter one way or the other, it\u2019s not going to be in 2019, right? So there\u2019ll be some sort of settlement\u2026","Rob Reilly","That\u2019s the FDIC expectation.","Brian Klock","Right. And if anything else - you go ahead.","Rob Reilly","It\u2019s a matter of hitting their threshold on the disk fund.","Brian Klock","That\u2019s right. So if anything, the fourth quarter guidance you are giving is not an expectation of a normalized expense level. I know you\u2019re not giving 2019 guidance yet, but..","Rob Reilly","No, we are not giving guidance.","Brian Klock","\u2026maybe just say it\u2019s a seasonal item.","Rob Reilly","The other thing I would say Brian is, the seasonal aspect of marketing, it\u2019s not that. Typically, in years past, our marketing expense actually declined in the fourth quarter. This quarter it\u2019s going up because of the digital investments that we\u2019re making. So the investment component of that is not seasonal, it\u2019s deliberate.","Brian Klock","Okay. So will that digital investment be something that stays into the expense base going forward? I guess is that - what will be different?","Rob Reilly","Well, we\u2019ll get into 2019 when we get on later in the year.","Brian Klock","Okay. All right. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. It appears that there are no further questions on the phone lines at this time.","Bryan Gill","Okay. Well, I would like to thank all of you for joining us for this quarterly call.","Bill Demchak","Thanks, everybody.","Rob Reilly","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bryan Gill. Sir, please go ahead.","Bryan Gill","Well, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today\u2019s conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC\u2019s Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO.","Today\u2019s presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information, as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today\u2019s earnings release materials, as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These materials are all available on our corporate website pnc.com under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of April 12, 2019, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bill Demchak.","Bill Demchak","Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. As you\u2019ve seen this morning, PNC reported net income of $1.3 billion, or $2.61 per diluted common share for the first quarter. Rob is going to run you through all the numbers in a second but I thought I would highlight a few brief items here. ","As you know, the first quarter of the year is typically negatively impacted by some seasonality as well as two fewer days compared to the fourth quarter and with this as context I really think PNC delivered good results. Linked quarter we saw very strong growth in average commercial balances and a small growth in consumer loans as well. Within C&IB the growth was actually greater than the headline numbers as we had a decrease in our commercial real estate balances of approximately $1.8 billion driven principally by our multifamily warehouse lines. If you exclude that, the real estate book C&IB growth came in at just over 4% quarter-over-quarter. We saw continued growth in our secured lending areas but we also saw growth in our more traditional cash flow lending businesses for the first time in several quarters. ","Reflecting normal first quarter seasonality, total fee income came in about where we expected. Importantly, expenses were flat and our overall credit quality remained strong. Our loan loss provision came in higher than we anticipated. But as Rob is going to discuss, it was largely driven by our strong loan growth and some reserves for certain commercial credits, nothing that we saw on a broad base basis. ","As we look forward from here, we still feel very good about the economy. Notwithstanding some mix signals from economic indicators, we have seen very little from our clients that would indicate that there is inherent weakness in the US economy. Having said that, there is clear weakness in the global economy, pressure from trade and fears of hard Brexit that will continue to weigh on the US economy. Regardless of the path ahead, we believe having a strong balance sheet, a solid mix of fee-based businesses, significant focus on expense management and differentiated strategies for organic expansion, will provide the foundation for success. ","Lastly, I did want to mention a couple of things that I am particularly proud of this quarter. The first of these is that that we learned just a few weeks ago that PNC has received an Outstanding Community Reinvestment Act rating from the OCC, the highest possible rating and one that we are proud to have earned for every exam period since the inception of CRA in 1977. And second, we're very excited -- we were very excited just last week to celebrate the 15th anniversary of PNC Grow Up Great, our signature philanthropic program focused on early childhood education. As part of this celebration, we extended our commitment to Grow Up Great which is now a $500 million initiative. Reflecting our main street model, our success depends a lot on the success of the communities in which we operate. Investing in early childhood education has proven to generate very high economic returns for communities and we\u2019re proud to support that. ","So overall, I\u2019m very pleased with the quarter and I want to thank our employees for their continued hard work to both drive our business forward and help our communities thrive.","And with that, I will turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our first quarter results and then we will take your questions. Rob?","Rob Reilly","Yes. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill just mentioned, we reported first quarter net income of $1.3 billion or $2.61 per diluted common share. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis.","Total loans grew $2.6 billion, or 1% to $229 billion in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Loan growth compared to the first quarter of 2018 was $7.4 billion or 3%. Investment securities of $82.3 billion remained relatively flat linked quarter, although purchases replaced portfolio runoff. Securities increased $7.7 billion or 10% year-over-year. Our cash balances at the fed averaged $14.7 billion for the first quarter, down $1.7 billion linked quarter and $10.7 billion year-over-year, commensurate with growth in loans and securities.","Deposits were up slightly linked quarter and grew $6.6 billion or 3% year-over-year. As of March 31, 2019 our Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated to be 9.8%, up from 9.6% as of December 31, 2018. Importantly, we maintained strong capital ratios even as we returned approximately $1.2 billion of capital to shareholders or 98% of first quarter net income. ","Total share repurchases were 5.9 million common shares for $725 million and common dividends were $438 million. And our tangible book value was $78.07 per common share as of March 31st, an increase of 9% compared to a year ago. ","Slide 5 shows our loans and deposits in more detail. Average loans grew $2.6 billion, or 1% over the fourth quarter, driven by commercial lending balances which increased $2.5 billion or 2%. We generated this growth despite the seasonal decline in our multifamily agency warehouse lending of approximately $1.5 billion, compared with the fourth quarter. And while not on the slide, it is worth noting that our spot loan balances increased more than $6 billion linked quarter. ","As we pointed out previously, our corporate and institutional banking loan portfolio can be divided into three categories: traditional cash flow; non-CRE secured lending; and commercial real estate. Our traditional cash flow lending grew 5% linked quarter, reflecting growth from new and existing customers, including higher utilization. This growth is in contrast to the lack of growth we experienced in this category in the second half of 2018, which was related to heavy competition, including non-bank lenders, and higher pay down activity. ","During the first quarter, we continued to see strong growth in secured lending which has increased 3% linked quarter and 14% year-over-year. ","Lastly, loans in our commercial real estate business declined linked quarter, primarily due to the seasonality of the warehouse lending but also due to competitive pressures. On the consumer side, balances increased approximately $100 million linked quarter and $900 million year-over-year. We had growth in residential mortgage, auto, credit card and unsecured installment loans, while home equity and education loans continued to decline. ","Average deposits increased approximately $700 million in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in consumer deposits, substantially offset by seasonal declines in commercial deposits. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, average deposits increased by $6.6 billion or 3%. ","In both comparisons and as expected, growth was in interest-bearing accounts. And we continued to see a shift from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits. Our overall cumulative deposit beta increased in the first quarter to 32% from 30% in the fourth quarter. For the remainder of the year, we expect our deposit beta to continue to increase but at a slower pace than last year given the current Federal Reserve interest rate held lock. ","As you can see on Slide 6, first quarter total revenue was $4.3 billion, down $54 million linked quarter or 1%. Net interest income was relatively stable despite two fewer days in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Non-interest income declined $48 million or 3% linked quarter reflecting seasonally lower fee income. Non-interest expense was flat compared to the fourth quarter as expenses continued to be well managed. Provision for credit losses in the first quarter increased $41 million to $189 million. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 16.3%. For the full year 2019, we continue to expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 17%.","Now, let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to Slide 7, net interest income of $2.5 billion was essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter despite the impact of two fewer days in the first quarter. Net interest income grew $114 million or 5% year-over-year. In both comparisons, higher earning asset yields and balances were partially offset by higher funding costs and balances. Net interest margin increased to 2.98% in the first quarter, up 2 basis points linked quarter and 7 basis points year-over-year. ","Fee income declined $31 million or 2% linked quarter, driven by seasonally lower first quarter transaction volume in consumer services, corporate services and service charges on deposits. These declines were partially offset by growth in asset management fees which increased $9 million or 2% and reflect a higher average equity markets and residential mortgage non-interest income which increased $6 million or 10%, primarily due to a lower negative RMSR valuation adjustment compared to the fourth quarter. ","Compared with first quarter of 2018, total fee income was stable as growth in both consumer and corporate services fees were offset by declines in asset management and residential mortgage revenue. Other non-interest income of $308 million declined $70 million linked quarter and increased $63 million year-over-year. Other non-interest income includes the impact of Visa derivative fair value adjustments which fluctuates in part due to changes in the share price of Visa common stock. ","Turning to Slide 8, first quarter expenses in total were essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter. Seasonality drove increases in personnel and occupancy, as well as the decrease in marketing expense. Equipment and other expenses were lower linked quarter. ","Compared to the same period a year ago, expenses increased $51 million or 2%. Personnel and marketing expense grew, reflecting both business investment and growth. Our efficiency ratio was 60% in the first quarter, compared with 61% a year ago. ","Expense management continues to be a focus for us and we remain disciplined in our overall approach. As you know we have a goal to reduce costs by $300 million in 2019 through our continuous improvement program and we're confident we will achieve our full-year target. ","Our credit quality metrics are presented on Slide 9. On a linked quarter basis provision for credit losses increased $41 million to a $189 million and net charge-offs increased $29 million to $136 million. On the commercial side loan provision increased $31 million linked quarter and this reflects our strong loan growth and higher utilization as well as reserve increases related to certain commercial credits. ","Commercial loan net charge-offs increased $5 million linked quarter to $12 million and remained at very low levels with a net charge-off ratio of 3 basis points as of March 31, 2019. The provision for consumer lending increased by $10 million. Consumer loan net charge-offs increased $24 million linked quarter, primarily from higher net charge-offs in credit card and lower recoveries in home equity. ","Overall, our allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans was unchanged at 1.16% as of March 31, 2019 and has remained at that level for the past four quarters. Notably, our forward indicators are both down linked quarter. Non-performing loans declined $41 million or 2%, compared to December 31, 2018 driven by a decrease in consumer non-performance and total delinquencies were down $49 million linked quarter or 3%. ","Our overall credit quality remains strong. However, at these historically low levels of provision, we will continue to see some volatility quarter-to-quarter due to the pace and mix of loan growth and the timing of specific loan reserves and releases. We believe that we continue to be appropriately reserved for the current environment as reflected in our consistently strong credit quality metrics. And importantly, we\u2019re not seeing any signs of broad based credit issues. ","In summary, PNC posted very good first quarter results. For the balance of this year, we expect continued steady growth in GDP and we no longer expect an increase in short-term interest rates this year. Our full year guidance remains consistent with what we shared on our fourth quarter earnings call in January. ","Importantly, in the first quarter of 2019, we generated over 2% positive operating leverage year-over-year and we remain well positioned to continue to deliver positive operating leverage for the full year 2019. ","Turning to Slide 11 and looking ahead to second quarter 2019 compared to first quarter 2019 reported results, we expect average loans to be up approximately 1%. We expect total net interest income to be up low single-digits. We expect fee income to be up mid single-digits. We expect other non-interest income to be between $275 million and $325 million excluding net securities and Visa activity. We expect expenses to be up low single-digits and we expect provision to be between $125 million and $200 million. ","And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions. ","Bill Demchak","Silvana, would you pull for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. ","John Pancari","On the balance sheet side, on the loan growth front, if you could just give us a little more color on what you're seeing there that\u2019s driving the better line utilization and even the pay downs, is this something that you think is sustainable and is it enough to potentially bump up or see upside to your full year loan growth of 3% to 4%? I know you\u2019ve kept that unchanged.","Rob Reilly","Yes. Hey, John. Good morning. It\u2019s Rob. So just a couple of things. In terms of the composition of the growth, we were pleased with the loan growth that was predominantly on commercial side. I think the -- when I talked about those three categories, I think the traditional cash flow category was very strong in contrast to what you were talking about the second half of 2018. And that was just increased activity across our commercial markets, very strong in legacy markets and the expansion in growth markets. So we feel good about that. ","As far as the full year guidance, we\u2019ve guided to 3% to 4% growth. We had average growth of 1% here in the first quarter itself. We're tracking to that range and I think we feel good about where we are but it\u2019s a little early and premature to change the full year outlook. ","John Pancari","Okay, alright. Thanks, Rob. And then separately I will just go straight to the elephant in the room. Bill, I just want to get your thoughts, I know there is a lot of speculation out there regarding the Wells Fargo post, and just would love to get your thoughts not only about if that would be of any interest but more importantly what would -- how you view your competitive position at PNC and why it\u2019s certainly more attractive possibly to stay where you're seated? Thanks. ","Bill Demchak","Almost don\u2019t even know how to answer that. I like my job here, I like our company, I like our prospects, I like the people I work with, I like our clients, I like our communities and I will end by career here. Beyond that, I\u2019m not going to speculate on successes or failures at our competitors. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. ","Betsy Graseck ","Just a couple of questions, one is on the commercial business. I know you talked about the loan growth coming in better. And I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about the competition in the non-bank space and do you feel that the interest rate and -- do you feel the pay downs that you had seen last year are slowing permanently or is this just a temporary slowdown due to 4Q\u2019s disruption in the capital markets and higher interest rates et cetera?","Bill Demchak","It\u2019s almost an unanswerable question. I mean I think the crack in the credit markets in the fourth quarter, Betsy, had to have helped on some of the volume that we saw at standalone market. But at the same time we saw pick up in utilization which would be totally independent of that. And we continue our pace just gathering new clients. So I think we will see what the future brings here. But we have seen for whatever reason the slowdown and pay downs and the uptake in the utilization and greater client growth, stronger retention, yes. ","Betsy Graseck ","Now that\u2019s helpful. And then separately, the Fed has got their NPR out there regarding moving the goal posts on advanced approaches banks. So could you give us a sense of how you're thinking through the opportunities for you assuming that NPR does get approved as written? And how you think through what to do with the incremental capital that you\u2019ve been -- that you would generate as a function of that? ","Rob Reilly","Let me start. Well Betsy, so as you know, the proposals were encouraged by the proposals, five key items there, two of which are a lot of work for us that you are not as interested in the elimination of the advanced approaches and then the possible elimination of the midyear [DFAS] [ph] for us. More meaningful in your interest would be the other three areas. One is the ability to opt out of AOCI, we will examine that. Secondly, the refinement to send in threshold deductions which for us is particularly meaningful because of our BlackRock stake. And then the third is the potential to reduce the LCR requirements from a full approach to a modified approach somewhere between 70% and 85%. So early for us. We are encouraged by all of that. We see potential in that for us. But until they're all approved, we don\u2019t have a firm answer for you. ","Betsy Graseck ","And just to make sure I understand when you say you would look at the AOCI impact et cetera, I mean is there a reason for not adopting that change if indeed NPR goes through?","Bill Demchak","Not terribly obvious one.","Rob Reilly","Yes. Not that I can say but we\u2019ve got time on the clock to be able to decide so. ","Betsy Graseck ","Okay. And can you size\u2026 ","Rob Reilly","Your inclination is correct. ","Betsy Graseck ","And then lastly, could you size like as you stand today and I know it\u2019s a moving target because prices change obviously. But could you give us a sense of the size of the capital free-up that would occur if it were to come through like last quarter, March 31st?","Bill Demchak","Yes. What we said -- and again this is just an estimate, we said in combination that it could add as much as 1% to our capital ratio, and that\u2019s an estimate but that gives you a rough sense of the lift. ","Betsy Graseck ","Okay. That\u2019s CET1, right? ","Bill Demchak","CET1 yes. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question. ","John McDonald","I wanted to ask about operating leverage and the goals for the year. Rob, if I try to parse the linguistics in the outlook for the year, it looks like you're shooting for positive operating leverage in the range of 150 to 200 basis points. Is that fair, is it kind of a new target and in what would it take you to get to the upper end of that? ","Rob Reilly","Yes. I think that\u2019s fair and we affirmed our full year guidance. So you can do the math to get to 1.5% to 2% and first quarter, we're tracking to that. So that\u2019s very fair. ","John McDonald","And then expenses were up 2% year-over-year, is that kind of consistent with your outlook for the full year and what you\u2019re shooting for a little closer to flattish? And I guess to what I am getting at here is, do you have expense saves that kind of gather steam which you get through the year or is this a good representation of ..? ","Rob Reilly","Yes, so I just think it starts with your first question here in terms of the positive operating leverage which is what -- that\u2019s our primary goal. Our guidance was for expense growth on the low end of the single-digit range which is where we are and I expect that to be the case going forward. It could direct higher if revenues go higher which would be a good thing, but then that just gets back to the operating leverage point. ","Bill Demchak","And vice versa which we don\u2019t have that. ","Rob Reilly","Well, yes, right, think that way, that\u2019s right. ","John McDonald","And then last one from me is, how much did the flattening of the curve affect the degree of difficulty on your net interest income goals for the year? ","Rob Reilly","I think for the net interest income goals, not much, because the rate increase that we had built in was September and the curve has been flat for a little while, maybe a little bit more. So not so much on the NII, more so on the NIM, even though we don't have official NIM guidance it puts -- flat yield curve puts more pressure on the NIM. ","Bill Demchak","Yes. I think you have a bunch of moving parts you need to think about. The flattening o the rally in the long end obviously impacts the yield at which we put our fixed rate assets and as those assets rolled on a curve and mature were now either making loans or investing in securities at a lower yield in the existing book. Having said all of that, the average life of our fixed rate assets is five years plus or minus. So it takes a long time for that to show up in the income statement and in NIM. The other thing is, we had a -- in our original forecast a rise in fed funds later in the year. But at the same time, we would've had commensurate expectations of deposit repricing which obviously fall away and remains to be seen what happens to betas here but if we're really on this sort of whole pattern, if what we\u2019ve seen through the first quarter holds, we will see less pressure on betas than what we might have expected when we started the year. And the final point of course is as it relates to total net interest income, all of those factors are dwarfed by our ability to continue to grow loans that makes sense for -- in our risk bucket. ","Rob Reilly","Yes, that\u2019s right. And that\u2019s why our full year guidance holds. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. ","Erika Najarian","Just wanted to follow-up on the commentary that you had on deposits. So can you give us a context of how robust or national digital strategy will continue to be if the fed continues to keep short rates where they are? And Bill was your comment on betas potentially easing if there wasn\u2019t a September rate hike more on your established markets or your newer markets?","Bill Demchak","Both, I think towards the end of a rate cycle historically you might have seen betas actually accelerate to the extent that, that funds were much higher than where they are today. In this environment at least for the last bit of time in our expectations, we don't necessarily -- we're going to say they are going to go up a little bit, total cumulative beta but not necessarily the spike you would have seen at the traditional end of rate cycle. Our newer markets basically are -- have been sort of stable on our price offerings since the last hike and would likely stay there. In terms of success of the effort, I guess I would say a couple of things. The first is, you dial up or down deposit balances of almost any size you want by being top of the price paid chart, particularly as a new entrant because you're not repricing your existing deposits on those platforms. We're spending more time today -- our deposits today are somewhere over $1 billion but to be honest with you we spend more time ...","Rob Reilly","Than national digital.","Bill Demchak","National digital, yes. We're spending more time, I\u2019m going to use the word experimenting, but maybe that\u2019s right, trying different strategies as it relates to the effectiveness of marketing dollars, pricing, activation, many other things we want to learn as we sort of accelerate the rollout of this into additional markets. I\u2019m so less worried about what the balances are doing day-to-day, more interested in the activation of accounts and the usage of accounts. ","Rob Reilly","And the mix of the distribution. ","Bill Demchak","Yes.","Erika Najarian","And my second question if I could just zoom out. You returned 14% intangible equity in this quarter, and the forward-look all seems to be positive in terms of positive operating leverage, continuing your superior credit quality and optimizing your capital. I\u2019m wondering as we think over the next two years, if the US continues to be in good stead, what returns on tangible common equity can your shareholders expect to enjoy? And within that range what do you think is an optimal CET1 ratio for a bank with your risk profile?","Bill Demchak","You want to start with that?","Rob Reilly","Well, we don\u2019t have ROE targets, Erika, as you know. We're encouraged in terms of the direction that you just summarized and would see our returns going up. We have a lot of E, as you know, and some of these proposed tailoring that might affect some of that. So we've always said in terms of what CET1 ratio do we need to run, we have always said around 8.5%, that indicates for the last handful of years that could come down a little bit following the proposed rules, but 8.5% is the best number that we have today. ","Bill Demchak","Well to be clear on that, what we do every year in terms of sort of our targeted numbers as we solve for it as a function of the outcome of the fed\u2019s severe or own severe stress outcome, we're doing that -- we've been doing that basically since the beginning. What's interesting is we go forward with the tailoring proposals as that outcome would likely drive or potentially drive our needed capital ratio to a level that would actually be below in my view where we would operate vis-\u00e0-vis the buffer to 7%. So what do I mean by that? Let's say that the math says, on my old math that I could actually run all the way down to 7.5% or even 7% in a quarter as a practical matter we wouldn\u2019t run there because a well capitalized is 7%, you're going to need to run some buffer above that simply for optics if no other reason but also for fear of ever breaking in a adverse economy. So we're going to have -- as these tailoring rules come out, we're going to have to have a hard look at that. The issue on return on equity, we have a -- we can sit and parse our return against peers 50 different ways but Rob\u2019s point is right, the biggest differentiation between us and others is we carry a lot of E. We also have a less goodwill. So on a tangible basis, we don\u2019t have other assets that are effectively earning without a capital. ","Rob Reilly","And we don\u2019t want to \u2026","Bill Demchak","And so be it. So I think it\u2019s very long answer to your question but the basic notion is let's grow the company on a healthy basis year-over-year being conscious of risks, be the firm that outperforms, so in the risk stress would be able to take advantage of that with a fortress balance sheet when it happens. We have done that for years, we will continue to do it. ","Erika Najarian","Thank you. And just as a follow up -- I\u2019m sorry to take so much time. But in the event that the proper capital ratio let's say based on what you were saying is let's say around 8 and you are closer to 10 today, what is the pace of optimization that you think would be appropriate for a bank again of your size and risk profile?","Bill Demchak","So you\u2019re basically saying what are you going to do on capital return and I don\u2019t want to -- we just submitted CCAR, so we will leave specifics out of it, but a couple of guiding principles. The first one is that we see very strong value in our shares today and see value in buying back our shares today, see value in providing a healthy dividend through time to our investors. I would tell you that there are prices in multiples of tangible at which we would slow down our buyback, we\u2019re not there yet today but there are prices where that would happen and you could potentially see our capital buffer build in those instances simply because more often than not when you get the lofty levels on multiples to tangible book, there is some downturn looming that you can put that capital to work at a much better prices. But for where we are today our intention would be to drive that ratio down and return capital to shareholders. ","Rob Reilly","Because we have access capital.","Bill Demchak","Yes.","Rob Reilly","And to your point, the dividend \u2026","Bill Demchak","And we see real value there. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. ","Ken Usdin","Just continuing along the lines of capital usage, and Bill, I know where you\u2019ve stood for a long time on the question of M&A. But just given the large transaction happened intra quarter and your comments just about your belief that you feel that the shares are attractive as is balance sheet growth, just any light that you can share just on the evolution of the landscape and where or where not PNC would want to play over the longer term even as far as being an acquirer or not? ","Bill Demchak","Nothing has changed, the SunTrust BB&T merger I think makes great sense for them and I think there is a set of competitors kind of waking up to the challenge of what it means to have scale particularly on technology spend as we get into a consolidated market. I think we've already done that spend. We already have that capability. We have the ability to grow organically. I don't value in acquisitions, particularly at today price, anything on the small side simply because of not the least of which because of prices but also just because if we take eye off the ball just doesn\u2019t make sense and doesn\u2019t change our outcome strategically. You will continue to see us look and execute on product or technology ads that aren\u2019t major in scale but make a difference to the offerings we have to our clients. If there is a market disruption, if there is a crack in credit which we don't see today but if there is, you would see us use capital to take advantage of that.","Rob Reilly","Like we\u2019ve done in the past.","Bill Demchak","As we\u2019ve done in the past. But as of now we think we have a really strong hand to play just pursuing our organic growth. ","Ken Usdin","Understood. And Rob one question for you. In terms of the fixed-rate assets and where the curve has gone, are you still seeing positive benefits as cash flows flow off of the securities book and the fixed rate loan book? And if so, what you\u2019re putting on new stuff ad versus where the roll off is? ","Rob Reilly","Yes, so Ken, in the first quarter actually we were -- what were buying was accretive to the yields as the curve has flattened out here in the latter half of the linked quarter, we\u2019re a little bit below. ","Ken Usdin","And would you expect that to be the case as you roll forward, sorry go ahead Bill? ","Rob Reilly","Yes, I do, slightly below, I do. ","Bill Demchak","Yes, I mean -- if you look at -- if you just look all our sequel, we have seen since the fourth quarter, I don\u2019t know, 35 basis point rally and I\u2019ll write swap yields in five years a little bit more than that in 10 years. And eventually again all else equal on risk that will show up through our fixed asset yields, that delta through time. It\u2019s a long period of time that, that will \u2026 ","Rob Reilly","Yes, so the outcome won't be a dramatic change. But the point to your question is the curves flattened out, so we're a little bit below now on our purchases. ","Ken Usdin","And are you guys hedged to the point where you want to be to that point, can I get your point on the swap delta, so do you have the construction set up as far as this rate environment carrying forward? ","Bill Demchak","We're -- I mean in effect we went into this -- and hindsight is 2020 but we went into this as a sense of ever short in effect, under invested. I still am a disbeliever in firm rates but they are where they are and all else equal we made a mistake on that. Having said that, we're not going to invest into this type of yield curve, we will kind of maintain where we are and watch it play out. ","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question. ","Kevin Barker","Just a follow-up on that question. Rates flat here, I mean deposit pricing likely to continue to move higher and reinvesting at negative yields on the fixed-rate assets, I mean would you expect a little bit of pressure here maybe in the second and third quarter on NIM before flattening out? Obviously you guided to NII staying stable \u2026","Bill Demchak","Yes, you\u2019re going to -- it wouldn\u2019t shock us to see NIM drop a couple of basis points as we move through the course of the year. There are so many things that move around inside of that as it relates to asset spreads as well and what we buy. But all else equal, yes, NIM should drop 1 or 2 basis points as securities and fixed rate loans roll down and we replace them at lower yields. There is a lot of stuff that would be on the other side of that, we\u2019ll have to wait and see. ","Rob Reilly","Yes. I think that\u2019s right and then obviously a big variable is the deposit betas and the cost of those deposits. ","Kevin Barker ","And then following on some of your comments around credit. Obviously we know the simple trend and feel comfortable with that but it did come above your guidance -- the provision did come above your guidance. And you did mention consumer lending. Was there anything in particular around C&I or any one-off credits given you saw the pickup in manufacturing NPAs? ","Rob Reilly","Yes. Hey, Kevin. This is Rob. No, nothing in terms of broad themes. Our provision was about guidance this quarter in large part because of the growth. But then a handful of specific credits that don't really had any common theme, the manufacturing that you see in the supplement there, there\u2019s a couple of names but that\u2019s one of our largest book, that\u2019s over 20 billion in loans there. So no broad theme, it\u2019s just you get a little quarterly volatility working off of these lower levels and in any given quarter a couple names could go on, a couple of names could go off and that\u2019s the variance that we experience.","Bill Demchak","One of the things that is probably masked this a little bit in the past is simply recoveries certainly starting out in the crisis when they were very high and basically we\u2019ve kind gotten to a place at this point where recoveries has trended off, corporates are largely operating at the rating level they want to achieve. And so we have less sort of upgrades as people get back to where they are and we have the traditional business of growing loans which is causing provision to slow a little bit. ","Rob Reilly","But again, so -- it's such a function off of these lower levels. When you take a look at our reserves to loan ratio, it is not almost 1.16, every quarter it is 1.16. ","Bill Demchak","But by the way we do not solve \u2026 ","Rob Reilly","No, we don\u2019t solve that, yes, we don\u2019t solve that yes. It is literally unchanged.","Kevin Barker ","And just quickly, so would you structurally expect higher severity going forward, frequency in line with what you\u2019ve expected in the past years? ","Bill Demchak","Higher severity meaning loss given the follow up or higher \u2026?","Kevin Barker ","Higher losses, yes, so if there\u2019s less upgrades and more loss on any default? ","Bill Demchak","None on a single default. I think all else equal, we\u2019re running at a charge off ratio that is unsustainable. So yes through time you would expect through the cycle charges to be higher. By the way, ours and everybody else as everybody keeps saying the same thing. Bizarrely, I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s what we're seeing this quarter but through time you will see a gradual increase. This quarter was more so than anything else just driven by growth which will take every time and by the way if you find that hard to stomach, wait till CECL comes along. And you see the impact from loan growth in your quarterly provision. But now there is nothing in there that\u2019s bothering us at this point. ","Rob Reilly","That\u2019s the important point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please proceed with your question.","Gerard Cassidy","Bill, you mentioned in your shareholder letter about expanding into markets through the technological innovations of digital banking. Can you share with us at what point we may actually see some metrics or maybe you have them already that we can monitor to see the success that you're having with the penetration from that strategy rather than the old-fashioned as you mentioned making acquisitions doesn't make sense today or you are going to do it through organic growth? How do we as outsiders measure that success?","Bill Demchak","That\u2019s a completely fair question, Gerard, and we are working on exactly how to bring that to life. I would tell you for now what we're looking at -- and we started out with a notion, we will launch a digital platform on a national basis with offerings that are geo-fenced and try to convert what starts out as a higher yield savings product into full-time clients, so ultimately metrics on how many accounts, how many deposits, how many are active, how many moved to virtual wallet and so forth. But also inside of our learnings as we go through that is how many branches we build in this digitally thin markets, largely following our C&IB expansion and what our strategy is around that, the cost associated with that. All of that continues to be developed and tell why we\u2019re spending time learning and testing in each of these new markets before we come out with the stated goal as to what we think this thing can be. Right now I think we just -- did we open the second branch in Kansas?","Rob Reilly","This month, later in April, Dallas, midsummer. ","Bill Demchak","Still early on at this and we\u2019re not spending huge dollars on it but I want to get sort of results that we can bucket that show our progress once we get a very clear go-to-market strategy around of each these new markets but we do that. ","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then the follow up question, when you guys look -- I know you targeted an efficiency ratio that as you mentioned on the return on tangible common equity ratio earlier in the call and you look at where you guys are today about 60%, many of your competitors have really started to make inroads into bring in their ratios down toward the mid 50s. Can you give us some color how do you think you may get what your roadmap is to bring that down? Again I know it\u2019s not a focus point for you folks. But how do you hope to bring that kind of number down which would of course drive profitability higher?","Bill Demchak","So if you read my annual letter.","Rob Reilly","Well, he did. ","Gerard Cassidy","I did, didn\u2019t remember all of that. ","Bill Demchak","But I think part of it?","Gerard Cassidy","Right.","Bill Demchak","Gerard, the issue here, we don\u2019t mange to an efficiency ratio but we could drive that number down quickly and materially by basically burying our heads in the sand and saying that we are not going to try to survive this digital onslaught of what is happening in retail banking. And bluntly many of our peers are shrinking themselves to greatness and not investing in what is an aggressively consolidating industry, whose share at this point going to the largest players largely on the back of great offerings. I want to be one of those people with great offerings and a larger player that consolidates across this country. And to do that we need to continue to invest which we\u2019ve been doing aggressively for the last seven or eight years. So we could stop doing that and show you metrics for the next couple of years that looked great and I think in the course of doing so we would seal our fate. So our focus here is on intelligent organic growth, good risk-adjusted return for shareholders and we think we have a real opportunity to do that inside of an industry that is just going through transformational change right now. So long story short that will be an outcome, not a targeted number. ","Gerard Cassidy","Do you think on the -- like you said it\u2019s not targeted number, is it more a denominator driven number, meaning you mentioned responsible growth, obviously you're investing in the numerator, which is expenses, any improvement will come more from just the growth being better at the bottom rather than cutting back on expenses?","Bill Demchak","Yes. My best guess is I\u2019d play this whole thing through, as you can imagine I do this most nights when I\u2019m struggling to sleep. I think what happens is you will see and you heard me talk about, this change in the income statement whereby you will see occupancy costs drop, you will see which has already happened, you will see technology costs go up, you will see the marginal cost of deposits increase as the price paid for digital offerings in an effect in footprint physical offerings if there\u2019s such a thing merge through time. You are going to see banks in their existing networks, expand in MSAs if they don\u2019t operate it today. And my best guess is our efficiency ratio doesn\u2019t change materially through time as much as our total E increases, as we grab share across this consolidating market. It depends on so many things but I think the cost to marketing, the cost and ability to move deposits are going to offset the gains you get by otherwise using technology and removing physical plans \u2026 ","Rob Reilly","At distribution. ","Bill Demchak","Yes. So the gross metrics don\u2019t change but the line items in the income statement do and I think growth potentially accelerates materially in the out years as this industry consolidates. ","Rob Reilly","Yes. And Gerard I\u2019ll just add -- it\u2019s Rob, clearly investment is a big component of our spend. But in sort of the short-term it is about the operating leverage. So provided that revenues are growing, we're okay with expenses growing especially if they are part of that revenue. So we have great fee businesses that have higher efficiency ratio and we\u2019d like to grow those as much as we can. ","Bill Demchak","And the final thing I will say because I am not -- we're not obviously indifferent to the amount of money we spend and we're very good at managing expenses. We go into our budgeting process every year and we don't talk about necessarily what are the new investments we want to make as much as we talk about $1, what is the $10.5 billion, whatever the number is that we're going to spend this year and build up from a base. So we take the management of expenses very seriously. But inside of that we're aggressive at wanting to be able to maintain the investment necessary to ensure our place and when I think is going to be consolidating market and we\u2019ve been doing that, you will see us continue that.","Operator","As there are no further questions at this time, I'll turn the call back to you.","Bryan Gill","Okay. Well, thank you very much for joining us and we look forward to working with you this quarter.

After the speaker's remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Director of Investor Relations Mr. Bryan Gill. Sir, please go ahead.","Brian Gill","Thank you, operator, and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call for The PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on the call this morning are PNC's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Bill Demchak and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Our forward-looking statements regarding PNC performance assume a continuation of the current economic trends and do not take into account the impact of potential legal and regulatory contingencies. Actual results and future events could differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in our statements and from historical performance due to a variety of risks and other factors.","Information about such factors, as well as GAAP reconciliations and other information on non-GAAP financial measures we discuss, is included in today's conference call, earnings release and related presentation materials and in our 10-K, 10-Q and various other SEC filings and investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under investor relations. These statements speak only as of July 15, 2016 and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Bill Demchak.","Bill Demchak","Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. You have seen this morning that we reported net income of $989 million or $1.82 per diluted common share in the second quarter. We continued to execute on our strategic priorities with overall performance you will have seen consistent with our prior guidance.","Now Rob is going to take you through the numbers in a couple of minutes but I will call your attention to just a few highlights. Specifically in the second quarter we saw revenue growth on the back of strong fee income, expenses that were again well managed, stable credit quality and growth in average loans and deposits. We maintained our strong capital position and you have likely seen the announcement that the regulators did not object to our capital plan submitted as part of the 2016 CCAR process and as such we are pleased to be able to announce that the dividend will increase to $0.55 per share beginning in the third quarter. We also announced plans to repurchase up to $2 billion of common shares over the next four quarters. So all in all it was a pretty good second quarter for PNC.","As we look forward in regards to interest rates the Fed appears to be back in a holding pattern on further target fed fund rate increases, at least according to the market. And post the Brexit vote we have seen long-term rates rally as global investors reach for basically any positive yield. And the combination of a strong dollar and positive yields in the US makes the US rate market preferable to virtually all others, and we have seen the impact of that.","Now the impact of these two issues, which are part economic and part technical, will result in more pressure on NII and NIM over time for PNC and most of the industry. In our case this is largely going to be a function of our securities books as higher yielding securities give way to lower yielding securities going forward. That being said, we know how to navigate in this environment.","And as always I can commit to you that we are very focused on those things that are within our power to control. We have opportunities to continue to grow fee income as we execute on our strategic priorities and we are also in a good position relative to our ongoing expense management efforts. And we have the ability to enhance those efforts to some extent as we continue to drive multiyear transformation within our lines of business in order to create efficiencies and deliver superior customer experience.","Equally important is what we are not going to do. Now while we won't speculate on the future path of rates, that doesn't mean that we don't have a view on value. We are not going to respond to market uncertainty by suddenly changing our risk profile and\/or stretching on credit or by significantly leveraging our balance sheet at what is arguably the worst possible time in the cycle.","Now PNC and its investors have long benefited from our disciplined commitment to well managed risk, well-run businesses and well served customers. And that is the approach that we will continue to take as we work to grow long-term relationships and create long-term value for all of our constituencies. You have heard me say this before but banking is a cyclical business and you can't beat the cycle. Our job is to mute the impact and to add to rather than detract from long-term value in the process.","And with that I will turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our second-quarter results. And then we will take your questions.","Rob Reilly","Great, thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. PNC second-quarter net income was $989 million or $1.82 per diluted common share. Second-quarter results reflected solid revenue growth driven by our focus on generating fee income. We grew average loans and deposits, expenses remained well managed and overall credit quality was stable as broad improvements in our consumer portfolio essentially offset a modest deterioration in our energy book.","Balance sheet information is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. Commercial loans were up $1.7 billion or 1% from the first quarter, reflecting growth in large corporate and real estate lending. Average consumer loans declined by $619 million or less than 1% linked quarter due to decreases in home equity and education lending, partially offset by growth in auto and credit card.","Investment securities declined slightly linked quarter as our reinvestments essentially matched repayments. Our interest-earning deposits with banks, mostly at the Federal Reserve, averaged $26.5 billion for the second quarter, up $930 million from the first quarter primarily due to deposit growth. Average total deposits increased by $1.5 billion compared to the first quarter driven by growth in interest-bearing deposits. On a year-to-date basis an increase in savings deposits has been somewhat offset by a decline in money market accounts, a shift in mix that reflects our strategy to grow relationship-based savings products.","Total equity increased more than $400 million linked quarter due to increased retained earnings and higher AOCI primarily related to net unrealized securities gains. As of June 30, 2016 our pro forma Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, fully phased-in and using the standardized approach, was estimated to be 10.2%, up from 10.1% linked quarter. Our return on average assets as of June 30 was 1.11%, an increase of 4 basis points linked quarter. And finally, our tangible book value reached $66.89 per common share as of June 30, an 8% increase compared to the same time a year ago.","Turning to Slide 5, our strong capital position has enabled us to continue to return substantial capital to shareholders. We completed our five-quarter common stock repurchase programs in the second quarter. During the period we repurchased 29.9 million shares for $2.7 billion. And when you combine that with the $1.3 billion in common dividends paid during the same period we returned a total of $4 billion to shareholders, resulting in a payout ratio of approximately 83%.","As you have seen -- as you definitely have seen since last month following the results of this year's CCAR process we announced plans to repurchase an additional $2 billion of shares over the next four quarters, beginning and the third quarter of this year. And earlier this month, our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in the quarterly common stock dividend affective with the upcoming August dividend.","As I have already mentioned, and as you can see on Slide 6, net income was $989 million. Highlights include the following. Total revenue was up by $129 million or 4% compared to the first quarter. Net interest income declined by $30 million linked quarter primarily due to lower purchase accounting accretion. Year to date, net interest income is up $42 million or 1% over the same period a year ago.","Total noninterest income increased by $159 million or 10% linked quarter primarily due to strong customer-driven activity in all our fee categories. Noninterest expense increased by $79 million or 3% compared to the first quarter as expenses continued to be well managed. Provisions for credit losses in the second quarter was $127 million, down $25 million compared with the first quarter as we continued to see some impact from our energy book but to a lesser extent than we saw in the first quarter. Finally, our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 24.3%. For the full-year 2016 we continue to expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 25%.","Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to Slide 7, net interest income declined by $30 million compared to the first quarter primarily driven by a $22 million decline in purchase accounting accretion. Core NII decreased by $8 million linked quarter as lower securities yields and higher borrowing costs were partially offset by loan growth.","Compared to the same quarter a year ago core net interest income increased $63 million or 3% primarily due to higher loan and securities balances and higher loan yields. Core net interest margin declined by 2 basis points linked quarter, reflecting a lower interest rate environment. Total net interest margin was 2.7% which included an additional decline of 3 basis point due to lower purchase accounting accretion. For the full-year 2016 we continue to expect purchase accounting accretion to be down approximately $175 million compared to 2015.","Turning to Slide 8, fee income increased by $201 million or 16% compared to the first quarter driven by strong growth across all of our customer categories. Total noninterest income grew by $159 million or 10% compared to the first quarter as other noninterest income declined. Asset Management fees increased by $36 million or 11% linked quarter, reflecting higher earnings from our equity investment in BlackRock as stronger equity markets benefited both BlackRock in our Asset Management business. Asset Management fees were down there over year primarily related to a $30 million trust settlement in the second quarter of 2015.","Consumer services fees were up $17 million or 5% compared to the first quarter as a result of higher client activity and seasonal increases in debit card, credit card and merchant services. Compared to the second quarter of last year, consumer services fees grew by $20 million or 6% consistent with our success in expanding relationships and growing share of wallet with our customers.","Corporate services fees increased by $78 million or 24% compared to the first quarter, primarily due to higher merger and acquisition advisory fees and higher loan syndication fees, which in part represented some delayed deals from the first quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year corporate services fees grew by $34 million or 9% with the same primary drivers. Residential mortgage noninterest income grew by $65 million linked quarter with most of the increase driven by net hedging gains of $35 million compared with a net hedging loss of $8 million in the first quarter. Production revenue also increased as mortgage originations were up 35% linked quarter.","Compared to the same quarter a year ago residential mortgage noninterest income was essentially flat as higher servicing fees were offset by lower production revenue. Other noninterest income of $264 million declined $42 million or 14% linked quarter and included negative valuation adjustments of $51 million primarily associated with nonconforming investments under the Volcker Rule provisions.","We also realized $31 million in net gains on the sale of Visa during the quarter. Overall our fee income results this quarter reflect our emphasis on our strategic initiatives and our efforts to grow fees across our businesses.","Turning to expenses on Slide 9. As you can see in the chart expenses have remained relatively stable and we continue to invest in technology and infrastructure. Second-quarter expenses increased by $79 million or 3%, primarily reflecting higher variable compensation associated with business activity and higher marketing costs, partially offset by the release of residential mortgage foreclosure-related reserves of $24 million. Looking at the first six months of the year, expenses are down $74 million or 2% compared to the first half of last year.","As we've previously stated our Continuous Improvement Program has a goal to reduce costs by $400 million in 2016. We are halfway through the year and we are already completed actions to capture more than two-thirds of our annual goal. We remain confident we will achieve our full-year target. Through this program we intend to help fund the significant investments we are continuing to make in our technology and business infrastructure throughout the year. As a result, we continue to expect that our full-year 2016 expenses will remain stable with 2015 levels.","Turning to Slide 10, overall credit quality was stable compared to the first quarter. The graphs on this slide depict the impact of both energy-related and non-energy-related loans on our credit metric. In the second quarter we continued to see some deterioration from our energy book but to a lesser extent than we saw in the first quarter. And I will have more to say about that in a moment.","Total nonperforming loans decreased by $17 million or 1% linked quarter primarily due to lower consumer NPLs. Provision for credit losses of $127 million decreased by $25 million linked quarter. However, our total provision, excluding energy, increased modestly compared to the first quarter, reflecting the continuing normalization over the historically and, in our view, unsustainably low levels we experienced last year.","Net charge-offs decreased to $134 million in the second quarter resulting in an annualized net charge-off ratio of 26 basis points, down 3 basis points from the first quarter. In addition, total delinquencies declined by $36 million or 2% compared to the first quarter.","Turning to our energy book on Slide 11. Overall not much has changed from the information we provided last quarter other than a slight decrease in exposures. At the end of the second quarter our oil, gas and coal portfolios represented approximately 1.5% of our total outstanding loans and we view this book as properly reserved. We did see an increase in net charge-offs in our coal portfolio in the second quarter. And this really relates to the small size of the portfolio, which by definition had some lumpiness as we highlighted during our first-quarter call. And as we have already stated we continue to monitor market conditions as well as impacts to other businesses.","In summary, PNC posted a strong second quarter driven by growth in fee income, reflecting progress we are making on our strategic priorities along with well managed expenses. We grew average loans and deposits and continued significant shareholder return.","Looking ahead we believe the US economy will continue to grow at a steady pace. However, given the uncertainty of the global economy we also acknowledge short-term interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve are unlikely to occur before December. As a result, our full-year 2016 guidance now calls for stable revenue, down from our previous guidance of modest revenue growth. And consistent with our previous guidance we continue to expect modest loan growth and stable expenses for the full-year 2016.","Looking at ahead at the upcoming quarter, we expect it will look a lot like the most recently completed second quarter. We expect modest growth in loans, we expect stable net interest income, we expect fee income to be stable as we anticipate continued growth in business activity in the third quarter to be somewhat offset by the elevated corporate services and residential mortgage fees we recorded in the second quarter.","We expect expenses to be stable as we continue to invest in our technology and infrastructure. And we expect provision to be between $100 million and $150 million.","With that Bill and I are ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator ","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Betsy Graseck ","A couple of questions. So part of the investment thesis in PNC is the excess liquidity that you have that can get put to work over time. And what I heard you say, Bill, is that, look, you are not going to do anything that doesn't make sense from a balance sheet perspective. So does that mean that you are going to continue to hoard liquidity for the moment? How do you think about using it and what are the trigger points for unlocking some of that potential earnings?","Bill Demchak ","Hoard sound like such a bad word. We have what is a $26 billion, I guess, at the Fed right now earning 50 basis points. And if we equal risk to our existing book absent LCR we are probably giving up $250 million total, rough numbers, if we replaced it at today's rates. If we did it in a way that was LCR equivalent, it is probably closer to $100 million to $150 million. And I continue -- look, I wish six months ago we had done it and then taken it off but we are not bond traders. And where rates are today the downside, the downside tail risk to trying to do that in today's rate environment just doesn't make sense to us. We will continue to invest roll off as things mature here. Unfortunately, it is getting reinvested at rates lower than what it is rolling off from and that is what my comments were about when I said that we are going to face NIM pressure going forward as the securities book rolls down.","But we are not going to put that money to work on the rate side versus where we currently are. We will put it to work on good loan growth when we see the opportunity for real economic returns inside the loan books.","Betsy Graseck ","So I could just a follow up on that is on loan spreads and what are you seeing there? And does that incent you to do more at this stage or not?","Bill Demchak ","Yes, so the spreads have largely flattened. They didn't really go out when the bond markets blew out but they kind of stabilized and they have stayed there. Now higher yielding leverage loans have come way back in with a high-yield market itself but we don't play in that space. Our issue with loans is more about total return across the relationship than it is about where the actual spread is on a loan. And that, of course, relates to how much of the fee wallet we can get from the client, at least on the C&I side. On the retail side there is opportunity. And to be honest with you in parts of it we have been executing less well than we otherwise could. Some of that is related to in mortgage on Fed regulations and some of it is related to things we can do to improve customer experience. So we want to grow loans but we want to do it in a way where we are getting a return on capital that is suitable for shareholders. And lending a loan, particularly on the C&I side, does not do that. It is a lousy return on equity and it drops our ROE.","Betsy Graseck ","So we should look more for the consumer to drive the bus there on loan growth?","Bill Demchak ","While, we are going to -- it is a strategic focus of ours as we kind of revamp what we are doing in consumer. We will continue to have growth in C&I. You have seen our growth in our real estate segment, much of that coming on the permanent lending side as the CMBS market remains in disruption. We continue to have growth in large corporate and ABL. Less robust growth but some in middle market. So there is growth there, it is just, to be honest I was somewhat surprised by some of the non-real estate related C&I growth numbers we saw from competitors. And my best guess on that is simply our focus towards the smaller end of large corporate as opposed to some other competitors naturally playing in the upper end where they [indiscernible] growth.","Betsy Graseck ","Okay, got it. So the Q-on-Q growth in mortgage going forward, how should we think about that? Because you have got some put takes between hedging gains that were large this quarter in the mortgage services line versus what we are seeing in pipeline build.","Rob Reilly","Sure. Hi Betsy, it\u2019s Rob. I think in the third quarter, particularly in where terms of where rates are just on the production and the origination side, we will see some modest increase and we are positioned for that. On the MSRs that is not something that we manage, that is an outcome. We did have a strong quarter in MSRs in the second quarter following losses in the first quarter. So that is really what I had to say about that for the third quarter.","Betsy Graseck ","So when we are looking at 3Q, start with 2Q minus MSR hedging gains and then up from there due to production?","Rob Reilly","Yes, that is where I sort of get into our guidance for the third quarter where I call it stable. I do think by and large net-net the residential mortgage was elevated because of those MSRs.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Miller","Can you talk a little bit about your different geographic expenses with loan growth? I know you have been down in the South now for about two or three years and how that is going relative to that Northern franchise?","Bill Demchak","It is Bill. The Southeast continues to outperform the rest of the legacy franchise by a fair margin in terms of not just low growth but fee growth and overall client growth and that is pretty consistent across everything in C&I and in retail. So we continue to execute on that and we are pleased with the progress we are making there.","Paul Miller","Are you -- geographically are you seeing different economic behaviors between the Southeast and your core areas in Pennsylvania?","Bill Demchak","In terms of just competition from other banks you mean?","Paul Miller","No, just overall economic demand for loans and whatnot.","Bill Demchak","No, I would suggest to you that at the margin the Southeast is a bit better. But having said that our legacy markets we have high market share. And so it is kind of easier to grow off a base of nothing in raw numbers and obviously in percentages than it is to find the next new client in Pittsburgh. So I think it is more of that than anything else.","Rob Reilly","Yes well I would add to that. I agree with that. The other distinction is in the Southeast as we get now four years into it we are seeing some growth in terms of the maturity of some of the relationships that take that long. So we are seeing a bit of a left there that is just a function of the time that we have been there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","John Pancari","On the -- back to the expense side, are you seeing anything, particularly I guess what we're seeing here with the long end of the curve or any of the other top-line headwinds or the competitive issues that you flagged, that are making you consider getting more constructive on realizing some of the benefits from the expense efforts you have underway now? Like I know you are obviously -- you are investing in your back office as well as the mortgage platform and everything and you have savings coming from that. But you have been reinvesting a lot of that prudently. But also given the top-line headwinds and the curve and post-Brexit, what are your thoughts there about potentially getting more aggressive and letting that fall to the bottom line?","Bill Demchak","Well, they\u2019re kind of linked in the following sense a lot of the investment we\u2019re making in technology is what is allowing us to take costs out of back office and processing. If you look at the drop in our retail expense base as we consolidate branches and automate, we\u2019re investing in technology to be able to do that, but ultimately get into run rate savings. So we say we\u2019re not going to slow down on our investments but partly because we don\u2019t want to slow down on our costs savings.","John Pancari","Yes, right.","Bill Demchak","I think a better answer to your question or kind of where you are going is, and I know it will come up in Q&A here somewhere is, in our annual Continuous Improvement exercise we are continuing to push on that, we are kind of ahead of the game on that. We will keep pushing on that. But importantly we have identified, particularly in the retail space, opportunities over the next couple of years, and we will talk about this further when we get more details on it. But basic opportunities to fairly dramatically increase the efficiency and productivity of what we do on the consumer lending side. You have heard us talk about that in terms of the consolidation of home lending but there is more to it than that. And sort of rather than slow down our investment priorities and save nickels and dimes, which we have already done, long-term expense saves come through structural change in the Company and that is going to take as a period of time. But we have got a team on it and we are after it and we are going to work through that over the next couple of years and see that fall to the bottom line.","John Pancari","Thanks Bill, that is helpful. And I guess would part of that be any potential acceleration of your modernization of your branches to the newer models? I believe you indicated about 400 or so branches are already on that model, I mean is there a way that that effort could be accelerated?","Bill Demchak","No, I think we are going at the right pace. Part of -- that is less about how much money you are willing to spend or want to save and more about executing in a way where you don't disrupt customers. If you think through that we need to train employees to operate in that environment, we need to acclimate clients to be able to use that environment. The teams of people we have who go out and do that training and so forth are kind of fully deployed and probably at the right pace. So my guess is it will accelerate as we go simply because we get better at it. But there is no magic to let's just do it faster.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Siefers","Rob, I had a quick question for you. You spoke a little about the mortgage outlook for the third quarter but wondered if you could expand upon those comments and just sort of give us a sense for where you see kind of the major pros and cons in that overall stable fee income outlook for the 3Q?","Rob Reilly","Yes, I would just say -- to expand on where I left off with Betsy's question was I do think we will see an increase, modest increase in originations in the third quarter reflecting some seasonal but also the lower rates on the available through the anticipated increase in refis. Don't see a huge step change there because we are, as we have mentioned before, we are working through TRID implementations and some processing issues that we have around the origination. So I do see some pick up there but not necessarily dramatic.","Scott Siefers","But I think the question is stable fees overall, so he branched off.","Rob Reilly","Yes, so I would say in terms of [Multiple Speakers] the total fee guidance, in terms of the stables we would see a continuation in each of those categories on the run rates that we have been in offset by the elevated levels in residential mortgage and also corporate services in the second quarter.","Scott Siefers","Okay, perfect, thank you. And then just one separate question, kind of a ticky-tack one. I noticed the CRE yield came under it looks like a little more pressure than is typical. I wonder if you could just sort of expand upon that from 351 down to in the 1Q down to 316 in the 2Q. Just any kind of comments you have?","Rob Reilly","Yes, that is virtually accounting [ph] accretion. So no big differences there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please proceed with your question.","Gerard Cassidy","Bill, you talked about at this point in the credit cycle, of course, you don't want to be making crazy loans, which I think everybody agrees with you on. And you are going to try to offset it with better fee revenue growth. Can you give us some color on some of the initiatives you have underway that could drive that fee revenue even better in the next 12 to 18 months?","Bill Demchak","Sure, and Rob can jump in here. But the fee growth we have been after and have succeeded at for however many quarters in a row, and we get there through pretty heavy investments inside of our treasury management business on the C&I side. As you know that is the bulk of our -- most consistent bucket of our fees inside of C&I. New product rollout we are putting in place a new wire system and real-time capability. So lots of things at the margin that kind of add to our opportunity inside of TM. In retail it is just the continuation of kind of what we have done seeing growth from retail to card to merchant to debit to straight through the categories and we just continue to pursue that. I think depending what happens here with rates through time we also have an opportunity inside of retail to raise revenue as a function of what I am going to call in-the-moment fees. And I think you have heard me talk about this before, but not a standard fee where we are just charging somebody more for some particular item, but rather offer products and services that a consumer can choose in the moment to pay for because it has particular value to them. For example, ready access to money real-time in cashing a check or other things like that. So we have got a list pages long as to what we are going to do on fee initiatives to continue to drive growth. And we think the risk return and cost of that relative to simply adding loans without commensurate share of wallet from clients it is a much better trade-off and longer-term opportunity for the company.","Rob Reilly","Gerard, this is Rob. What I would add to that is, and then on the Asset Management side, we continue to grow clients and expand relationships.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And just staying on this fee same, can you give us an update, Bill, on the clear exchange? Obviously you are one of the owners of this new rollout that is going to come and just what you think when it is going to hit, where customers will be using it and then what your thoughts are on possibly charging something for it?","Bill Demchak","Yes, so, you have seen the announcements where -- and if I get this wrong I'll apologize. But Cap One is now on it to some extent, USB, Wells, JP. We will roll out in the third quarter at some point to go live with it. I think it is incredibly important long term because in effect it creates a new payment rail. It will be when it is fully formed and launched in formal fashion probably in the first quarter it will be a real-time, ubiquitous P2P payment platform that offers alternatives to traditional ACH and debit and credit grails and the implications of that I will leave to your imagination but potentially are quite power. The issue of charging for traditional P2P as it is used today if you think in the context of [indiscernible] where it is small payments between individuals, that is I think rightly or wrongly we have seen the standard set at zero with first BofA and then U.S. Bank revision to go to zero pricing. I think there is opportunities, in fact I know there as opportunities as the use case of that product exchanges either for larger dollar amounts or for P to small B and so on and so forth. So I do think there is revenue opportunities associated with the pure P2P, but I think a bigger implication is the strategic importance of creating what in effect is an entirely new payment rail.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And then finally, if you guys could give us a little more color on the Volcker Rule ineligible investments, were those private equity or real estate? And in second to that, why was the mark taken this quarter versus next quarter or last quarter?","Rob Reilly","Okay, yes, well it is a broad bucket, Gerard, as you know the Volcker Rules go into effect this time next year. So we have a number of investments, the largest component of which is our private equity portfolio. So we are just positioning to be in compliance by this time next year.","Bill Demchak","I mean in effect, we make a decision that says, all right, we know we have to sell this thing, what's it worth it worth once you sell it versus holding it? You get a mark and you mark it and through time we will take a look at the related securities that are involved in that bucket and move them out before we get to the end of the Volcker window.","Gerard Cassidy","Great, thank you all of your help.","Operator","[Operator Instruction] And our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please proceed with your question.","Bill Carcache","If we go down a path where say the Fed concludes that the risk of raising rates at any point over the next, say, 12 months and possibly pushing the economy into recession outweighs the potential benefits can you speak to what happens to PNC's NII and earnings in that environment? And more broadly everyone is a little different but how should we think about PNC's ability to grow earnings in the absence of higher rates?","Bill Demchak","There are so many variables inside of that question. We model them all. You could have a scenario where the Fed actually raises the frontend and the backend rallies simply because of what is going on globally. But independent of all of that I think the simplest way to think about the direct impact of rates on our near-term income, all else equal, is a rolloff of our securities book which is at a 269 book yield plus or minus today and a replacement equal risk at about 169 over the course of a bunch of years that that would play out. Now if we really got into an environment where we believed that we were stuck here a la Japan, which I don't think is the case, we could put liquidity to work and raise our duration of equity if we got stuck into that. So there is offsets to it. That also obviously assumes that we don't grow loans or do many other things we do, grow fee and so on and so forth. Look, it is a simple statement to make that it is tougher to get to positive operating leverage without help or at least without pain from interest rates. But we are focused on being able to accomplish that.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. If I may as a follow up, could you remind us what you view as the appropriate level of CET1 at which you can run the business? For at least the last couple of CCAR exams you would have passed had you run with CET1 of around 9%. You are obviously north of 10%, is there anything that we saw in this year's -- or that you guys saw in this year's CCAR results that give you greater comfort in perhaps becoming a little bit more aggressive in your ask and maybe moving that down closer to 9% range, is that something that you guys are actively focused on?","Bill Demchak","Rob can chip in here, but just I will remind you that we don't set a top target number, we set a bottom target number which is a level by which we want to pass CCAR. And, of course, the unknown inside of that is the variance around our own modeling results and wherever the Fed would model and notwithstanding that we came quite close to there and number we got there, as did most of the industry by the way, with fairly different line items to solve to that number. And that gives me pause as it relates to our willingness to be aggressive in the sense that , I guess we could always take the mulligan, but in the sense that we think we know what the Fed is going to do and they don't I don't want to be caught in that position. Now this year, just as an aside, the test was a little bit tougher than last year, even our own run of our own numbers, the implementation and the add-on of operating risk into our results and then finally the fully phased-in aspects and some of the impacts we have that we didn't have last year impacted our ask this year.","Rob Reilly","Yes and this is Rob, I just would chip in just to reiterate what Bill said that the binding constraint is our post-stress ratio, not the preprint.","Bill Demchak","The final little sound bite, just to concur with your observation, we are running higher than we need to be. And at some point in time we can deploy that capital and would look to do so. But I would tell you that if we wait until some of the rules are a little bit clearer and there is new rules still coming out that will impact us and others next year, the cost of carrying that little bit of extra capital isn't so much as long as -- again we don't do something silly with it, which we won't. ","Bill Carcache","Right [Multiple Speakers]. Thank you, that is really helpful. If you guys will kindly allow me, maybe I can just ask one more follow-up to the initial question. So there are some folks, some banks that will talk about their ability to kind of still be able to grow NII through faster loan growth kind of offsetting NIM compression. And, of course, with you guys we are dealing with the purchase accounting accretion issues. But if you were to set that aside and you kind of move forward in time to the point where the purchase accounting accretion headwinds are completely gone, do you think that, is there like a structural difference between PNC's model versus other banks that are saying they can still grow NII even in an environment where rates don't grow or don't rise? Or would you guys be able to, as well?","Bill Demchak","No, look, we could grow NII. At issue is whether you think it is a good return to do it in the near term. So simple, look, go look at the growth in whole loan mortgages showing up on peers' balance sheets as they steer mortgage production out of their balance sheet versus putting it out into the market.","We could do more of that, that would grow our NII. You are putting on an asset that has only 1.5 year average life at today's rates, it goes to 13 years and a 50 basis point move. So my choice is that that is a lousy risk.","Bill Carcache","That is very helpful color.","Bill Demchak","Yes, so it is not -- we could do it, we could go out and participate in all of the loans that are getting done on the corporate side and simply book a 100% risk weight BBB rated corporate loan at LIBOR plus 150 with no cross-sell and take [Multiple Speakers]. That's a lousy way to go through life. It is not a good return on equity, not near-term and not long-term. ","Bill Carcache","Excellent, thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the question-and-answer session.","Brian Gill","Okay, well thank you all for participating in the call this quarter.","Bill Demchak","Thank you everybody.

Sir, please go ahead.","Brian Gill","Thank you operator and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Demchak, and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's presentation contains forward-looking information.

These are all available on our corporate Web site, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of January 15, 2016 and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Demchak.","Bill Demchak","Thanks Brian and good morning everybody. I know it's been a busy day for all of you and it was a pretty straight forward quarter end year first actually, so I am just going to have few brief observation to share and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Rob.","As you are seeing today we reported full year 2015 results with net income of $4.1 billion or $7.39 per diluted common share and the return on an average assets for the full year was 1.17%. In a pretty difficult revenue environment PNC performed well by executing on our strategic priorities and as we\u2019ve said before controlling the things that are in our power to control.","I\u2019d tell you I\u2019d even argue that the degree of difficulty in '15 was probably tougher than the year before, but again we delivered the solid consistent results that you guys have come to expect. In 2015, we grew loans, we had average deposits update percent, we had fee income up 3% and non-interest income represented a higher percentage of our totaled revenue mix in '15 than in '14, which is an important priority for us.","You have seen, we also maintain strong capital and liquidity positions even as we return more capital to shareholders through repurchases and higher dividend. And at the same time and importantly we continue to control expense as well. 2015 was the third year in a row that we brought down expenses despite major ongoing investments in our businesses and infrastructure.","In retail, we know have more than 375 branches using our universal banking model and we plan to convert another 100 or even more in 2016. In technology, we are in the late innings on our work to strengthen our core systems, fortify our cyber security and modernize applications. And once this is completed this infrastructure is going to allow us to shift more of our spend to offence focusing on consumer facing products and services.","Additionally, we continue to make progress on our other strategic priorities, building a leading banking franchise in our underpenetrated markets and capturing more investable assets. Now we\u2019ve got a few highlights there on the slide and I\u2019ll be happy to take -- talk more about this priorities during Q&A if you have specific questions.","But as we look ahead into 2016, we do expect our strategic priorities are going to continue to drive growth and fee income. We have the right model capabilities, cultures and peoples to continue to manage what is in our priority control and to deliver for the customers, shareholders and communities that we serve. And I believe that we\u2019re well position, particularly if the Fed continues to raise rates to generate positive operating leverage this year.","Having said that, we are obviously concerned about the global volatility in markets that we have seen over the last few weeks and even today and the potential for that to directly impact the U.S. economy and the result in Fed actions.","But I going to turn it over to Rob for now to just take a closer look at our fourth quarter and full year results and give you few additional thoughts on '16 before we take your questions. Rob?","Rob Reilly","Thanks Bill and good morning everyone. Overall our full year and fourth quarter results played out largely consistent with our expectations. For the full year we grew loan, deposits and fee income and reduced expenses even as we continue to invest in technology and our businesses. In addition we returned more capital to our shareholders while maintaining strong capital levels.","As a result our 2015 net income was $4.1 billion or $7.39 per diluted common share. Fourth quarter net income was $1 billion or $1.87 per diluted common share. Our balance sheet information is on Slide 4 and it's presented on an average bases. As you can see total assets increased by $1.8 billion or 1% linked quarter compared to the fourth quarter a year ago, total assets grew by $21 billion or 6%, primarily reflecting increases in investment securities, loans and interest-earning assets which includes balances held at the federal reserves for liquidity purposes.","Total loans grew by $1.2 billion or 1% linked quarter, primarily due to growth in commercial real-estate. A worth noting that on the spot basis, total commercial lending grew $2.4 billion or 2% primarily in PNC\u2019s real-estate business, which includes an increase in multi-family agency warehouse lending.","For the year-over-year quarter, total loans increased by $3.1 billion or 2% again driven by growth in commercial loans. Specifically real-estate and business credit as well as increased lending to our large corporate clients. Consumer lending decreased $396 million linked quarter as the decline in the non-strategic consumer loan portfolio was somewhat offset by growth in credit card and auto lending.","Compared to the same quarter a year ago, consumer lending was down $2.8 billion or 4%, primarily due to the continued decline a non-strategic home lending and lower educational loan balances again partially offset by growth in credit card. Investment securities were up $5.8 billion or 9% linked quarter and increased $13.6 billion or 25% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Portfolio purchases were comprised primarily of agency residential mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities.","Our interesting earning deposits with the Federal Reserve were $31.5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, down from the third quarter as we reduced commercial paper outstanding and shifted some Fed deposits to higher yielding liquid assets. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, our interest earning deposits with the Federal Reserve increased by $3.8 billion in support of our efforts to comply with the liquidity coverage standards. As of December 31st, our estimated short-term liquidity coverage ratio exceeded 100% for both the bank and the bank holding Company under the month-end calculation methodology.","On the liability side, total deposits increased by $3.5 billion or 1% when compared to the third quarter. Primarily driven by consumer deposit growth with an emphasis on savings products. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, total deposits increased by $17.5 billion or 8%.","Turning to capital, as of December 31, 2015, our pro forma Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, fully phased in and using the standardized approach, was estimated to be 10%, essentially flat linked quarter as we continued to return capital to shareholders through our dividends and share buybacks.","During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 5.8 million common shares for approximately $500 million. We are on track to meet our repurchase authorization of up to $2.875 billion for the five quarter period which began April 1, 2015. Period-end common shares outstanding were 504 million, down 19 million or 4% compared to the same time a year ago. Finally, our tangible book value reached $63.65 per common share as of December 31st, a 6% increase compared to the same period a year ago.","Turning to our income statement on Slide five, again net income was $1 billion in the fourth quarter and $4.1 billion for the full year. Our fourth quarter return on average assets was 1.12% and for the full year, it was 1.17%. In the fourth quarter, total revenue grew by $78 million or 2% compared to the third quarter as a result of higher net interest income and fee income. Core net interest income grew by $30 million or 1% compared to the third quarter, primarily driven by increased securities balances and loan growth, while purchase accounting accretion was flat linked quarter due to greater than expected recovers.","For the full year 2015, purchase accounting accretion was down $164 million compared to 2014. This decline was somewhat less than expected due to higher cash recoveries throughout the year. For 2016, we expect purchase accounting accretion to be down approximately $175 million compared to 2015.","Total net interest margin was 2.7% in the fourth quarter, up 3 basis points linked quarter. Total non-interest income increased by $48 million or 3% compared to the third quarter, primarily driven by higher fee income. Total fee income grew by $27 million or 2% linked quarter due to growth in most categories partially offset by lower fee revenue from residential mortgage and service charges on deposits. I\u2019ll have more to say about our fee income in a moment.","Non-interest income increased by $44 million or 2% linked quarter, largely due to higher business activity. Importantly full year expenses were down $25 million and as Bill mentioned this marks the third straight year we reduced total expenses, while supporting significant investments in our business.","These results are due in part to our Continues Improvement Program or CIP. During 2015, we completed actions and exceeded our full year goal of $500 million in cost savings. Looking forward to 2016, we have targeted an additional 400 million in cost savings through CIP, which we again expect to help fund a significant portion of our business and technology investments. Provision in the fourth quarter was $74 million, down $7 million or 9% from the third quarter. As overall credit quality remained relatively stable.","Finally, our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 26.1%, up from 20% linked quarter as the third quarter reflected tax benefits. Our full year effective tax rate was 24.8%. Looking ahead we expect our 2016 effective tax rate to be between 25% and 26%.","As you can see on Slide 6, non-interest income as a percent of total revenue has steadily increased during the last four years, and currently generates nearly half of our revenue. We have strategies in each of our lines of business to increase fee income across our franchise. Three of our business activity, asset management, corporate and consumer services, each generated more than a $1 billion in fee income in 2015. And their growth offset lower fee income from residential mortgage and service charges on deposits. For the full year asset management fees increased by $54 million or 4% as a result of new primary client acquisition, net asset flow and positive market performance in the first half of the year. Full year 2015 results also benefited from a large trust settlement that occurred in the second quarter. ","On a linked quarter basis asset management fees reflected stronger equity markets and increased by $23 million or 6% due to higher earnings from PNC's equity investment in Blackrock and new sales production. Assets under administration were $259 billion as of December 31st, up $3 billion linked quarter but lower than the $263 billion at the same time a year ago, largely reflecting equity market movements in both comparisons. Consumer service fees increased $81 million or 6% for the full year as a result of increased customer related debit, credit and merchant services activity along with higher brokerage income all consistent with our strategy of growing share of wallet in retail. Reflecting this momentum consumer services fees increased $8 million or 2% linked quarter due to higher merchant services and seasonally higher credit and debit card activity.","Corporate services fees increased by $76 million or 5% in 2015 and included higher treasury management and commercial mortgage service fee. Our corporate and institutional business also saw strong full year results in capital markets. On a linked quarter basis corporate services fees increased by $10 million or 3% primarily due to higher merger and acquisition advisory fee and higher loan syndication. Residential mortgage non-interest income declined by $52 million or 8% for the full year primarily due to elevated secondary loan sales in 2014 that didn't repeat in 2015. As well as lower servicing fees. On a linked quarter basis residential mortgage fees decreased $12 million or 10% primarily as the result of lower sales revenue and net hedging gain. Fourth quarter originations were $2.3 billion down approximately $200 million or 8% compared to the same quarter a year ago, due in part to closing delays resulting from the implementation of new disclosure requirements.","Service charges on deposits for the full year declined by $11 million or 2% and on a linked quarter basis they were down by $2 million or 1%. In both periods the lower revenue was driven by evolving customer behavior and product changes. Lastly, full year total other non-interest income decreased by $51 million or 4% primarily due to a higher level of asset sales in 2014. Of note gains from the sales of Visa Class B common shares were approximately $40 million less in 2015 compared to 2014. And on a linked quarter basis total other non-interest income increased by $21 million or 7%, primarily driven by asset sales.","Turning to Slide 7, overall credit quality remains relatively stable in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, non-performing loans were down $51 million or 2% linked quarter driven by improvements in the consumer lending portfolio partially offset by increases in commercial loans. Total past-due loans were down $23 million or 1% linked quarter as we saw small declines in most categories. Net charge offs of a $120 million increased by $24 million due to higher growth charge off levels and lower recoveries compared to the third quarter. In the fourth quarter the net charge off ratio was 23 basis points of average loans up from 19 basis points in the prior quarter. Our provision of $74 million was down $7 million or 9% from the third quarter. Consistent with our previous disclosures during the fourth quarter we implemented the de-recognition of $468 million in purchase credit, impaired loan balances and the associated allowance for loans related losses.","These balances were related to loans that had been paid off, sold, foreclosed or have nominal value. Importantly this change had no impact on EPS, the net carrying value of the pools or accretion accounting. The allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans is 1.32% as of December 31st, this compares to 1.58% linked quarter and 1.63% at the same time a year ago. The decline in both periods was primarily attributable to the implementation of the de-recognition.","We are cognizant of the volatility effecting the energy related in commodity sectors. That stated not much has changed regarding our exposures since last quarter. Specifically on oil and gas we have a total of $2.6 billion in outstanding, which is relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. This represents approximately 2% of our total commercial loan book. We have approximately $700 million in outstanding to Energy and Production Company, $1 billion to midstream and downstream and $900 million to oil services. Approximately $200 million of this services portfolio is not asset based on investment grade and this poses a greatest near term risk consistent with what we've been telling you the last few quarters. We continue to experience some portfolio deterioration in the fourth quarter, though charge-offs were quite modest. And during the quarter we increased our reserves to reflect the incremental impact of the continued decline in oil and gas prices.","In summary PNC posted fourth quarter and full year earnings consistent with our expectations. Turning to 2016 we're obviously off to an unexpected rough start to the year relative to the global macro economy. However our 2016 operating plan completed at the end of last year and prior to this recent volatility assumes continued steady growth in GDP and a corresponding increase in short term interest rates three times this year, in March, June and December with each increase meaning [ph] 25 basis points.","Based on these assumptions our full year 2016 guidance is for modest growth in revenue and stable expenses which by definition positions us to deliver positive operating leverage. And as we've said before we continue to expect credit costs to normalize on a gradual basis. In regard to the recent economic conditions, we acknowledge it\u2019s unclear how long these conditions may persist, but should they continue for a long period it will impact our plan and we will adjust accordingly.","Looking ahead at the first quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 reported results, we expect spot loans to be up modestly, but average loans to be stable as the calculation of the average balances will be impacted by the de-recognition implementation. We expect net interest income to increase in the low single digit range. We expect fee income to be down mid-single digits due to seasonality and typically lower first quarter client activity. We expect expenses to be down low single digits and we expect provision to be between $75 million and a $125 million.","And with that Bill and I are ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Thank you so much for giving us details in terms of what's embedded in your plan from an interest rate outlook perspective. I was anticipating that investors will be curious about what you mean by adjust accordingly. As you can imagine investors are a little bit more cautious about the pace of this set and as you think about the trade-offs between delivering positive operating leverage if the set doesn't raise three times versus delaying some of the investments that you've mentioned, I guess is it adjusting accordingly on the expense side or just take us through essentials?","Bill Demchak","It\u2019s adjusting accordingly in terms of the guidance we give you in its simplest form. So, our plan takes those assumptions today and by the way some investors and even the Feds dot [ph] taught themselves I guess having going four times, obviously the market doesn't believe that today. We're three weeks into the year, so we're not going to bin a whole planning process until we see how it plays out, and as it plays out we would give you, as we do always quarterly guidance on what you might expect. I don't think as we've said before that near term pressures on rates and\/or localized pressures on the economy are going to dramatically shift our investment profile, largely because we continue to be able to fund that profile through continuous improvement and hold costs constant. So, you're broader question, can we get to positive operating leverages, so many embedded assumptions on that in terms of what credit cost doing rates doing and everything else we'll have to see.","Erika Najarian","And in terms of your capital management for the year and in terms of us trying to back into what you could distribute post 2016 CCAR, your CEP1 [ph] ratio was kept flat at 10% which seems high relative to the risk profile and the size of the bank and I'm wondering if to you Bill that seems like an appropriate level to think about for '16 as well.","Bill Demchak","I would remind you and we've talked about this before that there is not a magic boundary on this kind of 100% payout ratio in terms of what we could request, I'd also remind you that we talk about focusing on the post stress ratio as opposed to the starting ratio which is the one that's obviously your binding constraint. As we run our base case, and the other thing that we've talked about in the past is that our base case typically for a variety of reasons ends up being lower than what we in fact produce in income. All of those things suggest that we'll have an opportunity to go back and be aggressive in terms of capital returns ask, until we see what actually comes out of the Fed in terms of instructions, that the definition of aggressive will have to be rather vague at this point, because as I've said despite that we're at 10 today it's really dependent on where we\u2019re going to end up post there stress scenario.","Rob Reilly","And just to add to that Erika, as you know we are well positioned to return capital to shareholders we just have to see what their scenarios are.","Erika Najarian","Got you. Thank you very much.","Bill Demchak","Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please proceed.","John Pancari","Just similar to the line of questioning, in terms of how we should think about spread revenue growth and the margin outlook. Can you just give us some way to think about the sensitivity if we don\u2019t see any Fed moves, what we could think -- what we can expected by way of the margin progression as well as the spread rev? Thanks.","Rob Reilly","Yes sure, as you know we don\u2019t give specific guidance around NIM, that\u2019s an outcome. Our plans do call for growth in NIM, but they are largely reliant on increases and rates. Now naturally there is other variables involved in terms of pricing on loans and securities that would factor into that, but I think generally speaking if your question just sort of is where does this outcome play out if you don\u2019t get Fed rate increases, its probably stable plus or minus the small amount.","John Pancari","Okay alright that\u2019s helpful thanks. And then separately in terms of how we should think about loan growth beyond the first quarter, I know you indicated relatively stable for the first quarter '16 but what's a -- how are you thinking about full year particularly given some of the uncertainty on the micro back drop? Thanks.","Rob Reilly","Our plans call for really a continuation of what we have seen for a while which is continued growth on the commercial book for PNC largely in our specialty businesses. And then on the consumer side relatively flat, overall home equity, obviously some of the non-strategic working down off set by what we would expect to be a continued growth in credit card and possibly although it's smaller level auto [ph].","Bill Demchak","I think you know one of the offsets if in fact we get into a surprises here as it relates to the discuss in the economy and increasing credit cost, our specialty businesses actually tend to pick up growth in stressful situation. So our plan kindly called along with our GDP assumption for moderate growth, but in a down turn scenario same way you saw back through the crisis we actually have the ability through the specialty leading to do correct -- quite well.","John Pancari","Okay and Bill, if I could give you one more here on the capital to deployment side, could you just remind us of your thoughts around M&A, I know you have been more tempered to terms of that outlook, but just wanted to get your updated thoughts at this point.","Bill Demchak","Tempered is one word. As it relates to tradition of bank M&A we are not interested, we are not involved there is a variety of reasons you\u2019ve heard me talk about before. Sometime through time could that somehow change sure because forever is a long time, but today it's not on our radar. I would tell you that we have taken some small investments and syntax [ph] stuff you would had seen an announcement with EWS and Clear Exchange in partnership with six other large banks to put a P-to-P product out on a ubiquitous way to all bank clients. We are interested in distributive ledger block chain technology, we are interested in some of the corporate payments dispersement technology, none of these are big numbers. But in terms of our focus and where we think about growth opportunities in how to deploy capital it would be much more focused in that area than it would be a traditional bank deal.","John Pancari","Got you thank you.","Rob Reilly","Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Rob Placet","Hi this is Rob from Matt\u2019s team. I was just curious if you can updates on your thinking for the reinvestment of the 30 billion or so liquated on the balance sheet, where you may look to deploy that and the timing?","Rob Reilly","Sure Rob, so consistent with what we said on prior earnings calls we do have a large balance there that was largely driven by meeting the liquidity coverage ratios and given the growth in deposits and the way to year played out, those balances actually went into excess of that. We have started to put some of that to work at this past quarter, you could see in some investment securities. And probably the best way to answer your question is we could shift 10 billion of that into other high quality securities without jeopardizing the liquidity coverage.","Bill Demchak","The other thing you\u2019d see if you dig through the numbers is, we\u2019ve paid down some wholesale debt, short term funding that didn\u2019t come for LCR and some of the -- I think there was even a sub-debt deal that deal that went [multiple speakers], which drops our funding cost helps in the, as well. So you could see that decline both as we change our funding mix but also as we deploy cash into higher yielding assets.","Rob Placet","Okay thank you.","Rob Reilly","Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Please proceed.","Gerard Cassidy","Rob can you share with us in terms of what you are seeing on the underwriting standards and commercial real-estate and construction loans or what your loan guys are telling you? And second has there been any change in those underwriting standards in the marketplace since the regulators came out in December expressing concerns that those standards that too aggressive?","Rob Reilly","Well, to your first part of your question Gerard in terms of our commercial real-estate. We continue to see growth there, not quite at the same levels that we\u2019ve seen in the past years. But the big difference there and it didn\u2019t really sit up in the fourth quarter, but it\u2019s been happening for a while, is the shift in the emphasis in terms of what we\u2019re lending into much, much more around the permanent lending. You can see that in our supplement and less so on the construction sides in terms of a mix. So our commercial mortgage loan balance as you can see it continued to increase quarterly and we would expect that to continue.","Bill Demchak","Part was what\u2019s happening is the combination of a lot of the European Banks pulling back post-crisis. And then the lack of volume that\u2019s getting through the CMVS market is continuing the opportunity for what historically has been called Life Insurance product. But basically balance sheeting term loans with good debt service coverage and loan to value ratios kind of as we hit this big CMVS maturity double plus their projects get funded and come online.","So that\u2019s kind of where we see the opportunity. The bankers will tell you and as we look at markets, we\u2019re obviously concerned about energy heavy cities, we\u2019re a little bit concerned about some of the technology heavy cities across all property types and that you would see that in our underwriting criteria in the step that we target to the extend we\u2019re still doing new projects.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you and then in your press release and the Corporate and Institutional Banking section, you guys give us some color, you talked about the loans growing about 1% over the third quarter, it was due to some real estate business credit that you generated, as well as large corporate. But then you put in there partially offset by the impact of capital and liquidity management activities, can you give us some color what that it was?","Bill Demchak","Yes. So combination of LCR requirements and the cost associated with LCR and simply capital regulatory capital requirements again certain types of lending only relationships caused the return to be below the standard we\u2019d otherwise like the hold. And so we\u2019ve shifted the mix and inside of our growth you\u2019d actually see a lot of run-off in lower returning relationship. A lot of that shows up in what is broadly defined as the financial services space, you\u2019ll see a lot of that in the public finance space. Where those balances have decline and frankly have somewhat masked the real growth that is underlined inside of C&IB as we\u2019ve run those balances down.","Rob Reilly","And Gerard, you\u2019ll recall that was a bigger issue in the third quarter where we have more of those balances run-off. So it\u2019s the same issue just a smaller amount in the fourth quarter.","Gerard Cassidy","And not to put words in your mouth. So if it\u2019s not meeting your internal return targets your willing to give this business up, is that correct?","Bill Demchak","Sure.","Rob Reilly","Definitely.","Gerard Cassidy","Good, no that\u2019s good. And then finally Rob, I apologize if you addressed this in your prepared remarks and I didn\u2019t hear it. But going into the first quarter, I know you showed us that the net interest income will be up slightly, so the increase in your margin in this quarter. With the Fed funds rate increased that we saw in December, should that have a positive impact on the net interest margin in the first quarter?","Rob Reilly","Yes, a bit. Definitely it will have an impact on the net interest income. But the margin moves a lot slower.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. I appreciated. Thank you, guys.","Bill Demchak","Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners. Please proceed.","Scott Siefers","Bill couple of questions ago you talked about the potential benefited dislocation in your specialty business, I guess pricing [multiple speakers] the risk reward improves et cetera. I wonder if you could sort of apply those comments to the broader portfolio. Are you seeing anything thus far just given that dislocation which I guess for now has been largely limited to the capital markets? But have you seen anything in the broader portfolio that would lead you to feel better?","Bill Demchak","Yes. It\u2019s interesting, we haven\u2019t really seen the spike in lending spreads that potentially could occur. In fact did occur in 9 -- particularly in \u201909, particularly with the leverage product. Where we probably have seen some benefit as the cash flow leverage loans done to do buyouts in M&A, think middle market private equity and so forth. As the market for that has become tougher and you\u2019ve read about the Hung\u2019s [ph] indications, opportunities increased for our asset based lending business as a substitute for that. We\u2019ve already seen it, it\u2019s part of the growth embedded in there and I expect it will continue.","Scott Siefers","Okay. Alright, that sounds good. Thank you very much.","Bill Demchak","Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please proceed. ","Ken Usdin","If I can ask a question on just your fee income outlook, it had some really good seasonal strength as you usually do and we understand the first quarter seasonality. Can you talk about, what you expect to be the drivers within fee income this year given what looks like there will be some challenges whether it\u2019s borne by the markets or residential mortgage comparisons or what not. But what do you think is going to drive fee income growth?","Rob Reilly","Well I think, if you take a look at it, we agree we think we had a strong fee story in 2015 and I think much of what drove that we would expect to continue into '16 because this is central to our strategy, is to grow these fee businesses across the broader franchise. So if you just walk down in a bit asset management, we would expect to be able to continue to grow, I guess we have to put some parenthesis around where these markets sort of play out and it\u2019s my earlier comments in terms of this, they continue to persist over a prolonged period that could in the short term affect that, but long term we see big growth continuing there. Consumer services, a lot of momentum we've been growing at mid-single digits and we would expect to be able to do that through time. Same with corporate services. Residential mortgage is struggling in terms of where we are in the rate cycle and everything that's going on there, but of course that's a smaller number. So I think it's pretty.","Bill Demchak","I think the one caveat, if we ran into a lumpy capital markets, inside our corporate services the biggest driver there is our treasury management business and we continue to grow that at a healthy clip both through introduction of new products, but also through cross sell you know down into the southeast. But this year we did have a great year inside of our capital markets activity with corporate security fees loan syndications and Harris Williams while down a bit from last year, you know this is the second best year ever. So we could see some pressure conceivably in what we would call our capital markets line. But in terms of raw size that is so dwarfed by what we do in treasury management you know we'd like to think we could outgrow it.","Ken Usdin","Understood, and one just follow up, that other income line ex the Visa and Securities gains, can you just remind us what a kind of typical range is for that line and do you see any major changes one way or the other there.","Rob Reilly","Not a whole lot, we guide ex-Visa, we guide 250-275 a quarter and I think that's a good number.","Ken Usdin","Okay, thanks a lot guys.","Bill Demchak","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you sir, our next question comes from the line of Paul Miller from FBR, please proceed.","Paul Miller","I know in your past guidance that you've been somewhat bullish and I think you were calling for like 200 basis points of rate hikes. Has the volatility over the last -- have you answered this question already, I apologize, I've been jumping all over the place, but is the volatility in the markets over the last two weeks changed those assessments? ","Bill Demchak","Sorry, let me. First off our guidance had three rate hikes, 25 each through the course of '16 and the volatility in the last three weeks you know has caused concern but hasn't caused us to be in a plan after three weeks of disruption, we'll let this play out and see where we end up. You have to -- the thing you always have to hold in the back of your mind is we're coming off of a base of zero, so we're still wildly accommodative and notwithstanding some localized stress in the economy, as you know doesn\u2019t necessarily stop you from raising rates. You know the offset to that is that we're seeing even in some numbers today, we know the Fed is watching inflation and the inflationary numbers continue to be really benign, notwithstanding some at the margin inflation and wages where we\u2019re seeing it from imports and other places. So we'll let that play out, but we had three increases in our plan, they happen or they don\u2019t, it will affect their results or not, you know we'll update you as we go.","Paul Miller","And I know a lot of peoples have been asking about credit out there, but do you see any regions because you do go across pretty much most of the Mid-East coast. Do you see any regions besides some of those energy sector areas in Pennsylvania that are struggling? ","Bill Demchak","It's, I mean energy sectors broadly, but you know I wouldn't isolate that to Pennsylvania. We\u2019re actually -- you know the localized economy here notwithstanding some reliance on coal and natural gas is actually quite strong. We see some pressure down not surprisingly into Texas and other areas on our energy book and it's starting to spread as you would expect it would into at the margin real estate and other service providers from everybody from accountants to lawyers than anybody who was in the game as the oil boom started. But you know that's kind of at the margin and beyond that I don't know that we see a particular region in the country that is standing out although I\u2019d tell you, Mike Lyons who runs our CNIB [ph] business just finished a grand tour around the country, seen a lot of clients and kind of came back with the notion that more so than he saw in the last time he was through, he said people are feeling more margin pressure and at the margin a little lower activity than they otherwise thought they'd see at this point in the year.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bryan Gill. Sir, please go ahead.","Bryan Gill","Well, thank you, Colin, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today\u2019s conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC\u2019s Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and CFO.","Today\u2019s presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in today\u2019s earnings release, related presentation materials and SEC filings. These materials are all available on our corporate website pnc.com under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of July 13, 2018, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Demchak.","William Demchak","Thanks, Bryan, and good morning everybody. You've seen this morning that PNC reported second quarter net income of $1.4 billion or $2.72 per diluted common share. Overall, we thought it was a really good quarter highlighted by continued solid execution on our strategic priorities with our key financial metrics all moving in the right direction. ","You would have seen we grew loans on both the corporate consumer side and we also grew deposits this quarter. We grew our net interest income and NIM as we increased investment securities and reduced our cash position at the Fed. We grew fees in customers and we managed expenses while achieving positive operating leverage and improving efficiency. ","Credit quality remains strong with non-performers declining and loss is stable. We maintained our strong capital and liquidity positions in the quarter and the Fed accepted our capital plan without objection. The CCAR severely adverse scenario this year was definitely much tougher than it\u2019s ever been before but as the results indicate we would remain well above the post stress minimums. ","In regard to our capital return plan, I would point out our focus this year was to deliver a solid increase in our dividend which we did. On the share repurchase component, with the benefit of hindsight, we were obviously more conservative with our submission than we needed to be. Importantly though I want to emphasize that we continue to see buybacks as being attractive at current levels. ","Finally, we continued to invest in our businesses. These investments include our digital products and service offerings, new consumer and small business lending projects, healthcare payments processing and the ongoing expansion of our middle-market corporate banking franchise. ","In fact, I am happy to announce that on the back of the early success we\u2019ve had in our previously announced expansion markets over the last 18 months or so, we are looking forward to further expanding the franchise in the Boston and Phoenix in 2019. ","Half way through the year, we feel good about our execution. Our relationship-based business model is working and that is creating growth opportunities for us. All that said, we have a lot of work to do in the back half of the year including the launch of our national retail digital model. ","Before handing it over to Rob, I just want to thank our employees for the continued hard work as well as our clients for their trust in us. ","With that, over to you Rob.","Robert Reilly","Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As you are seeing by now and Bill just mentioned, we reported net income of $1.4 billion or $2.72 per diluted common share. And it was a good quarter by virtually all measures. Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and it\u2019s presented on an average basis. ","Total loans grew by 1% linked quarter and 3% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Investment securities increased 4% linked quarter as we continue to deploy our liquidity. And relatedly our cash balances at the Federal Reserve were down linked quarter and year-over-year. ","Deposits were relatively stable linked quarter and up 2% year-over-year. As of June 30, 2018, our Basel III common equity Tier-1 ratio was estimated to be 9.5%, down from 9.6% as of March 31, 2018 reflecting continued strong capital return to shareholders and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income. ","Importantly, we maintained strong capital ratios even as we returned $1.2 billion of capital to shareholders or 92% of second quarter net income. We repurchased 5.7 million common shares for $823 million and paid dividends of $354 million. ","Following the CCAR results last month, we announced a new plan to repurchase up to $2 billion of shares over the next four quarters. Earlier this month, our Board also approved a 27% increase in the quarterly dividend to an all-time high of $0.95 per share effective in August. ","Our return on average assets for the second quarter was 1.45%, our return on average common equity was 12.13% and our tangible book value was $72.25 per common share as of June 30, an increase of 5% compared to a year ago. ","Turning to Slide 5, average loans were up $1.6 billion or 1% linked quarter and $6.3 billion or 3% compared to the same quarter last year. Commercial lending was up $1.5 billion compared to the first quarter. The growth was broad based across our C&IB businesses, led by corporate banking and business credit and pipelines remain healthy. ","Compared to the same quarter a year ago, commercial lending increased $5.5 billion as strong growth was partially offset by declines in our real estate business. CRE remains challenged as we continue to see fewer deals that meet our risk appetite and pay-offs continue at a steady rate. ","Consumer lending increased by approximately $100 million linked quarter and $800 million year-over-year reflecting growth in auto, residential mortgage and credit card loans. This was partially offset by declines in home equity and education lending. ","Investment securities of $77.5 billion increased $2.8 billion or 4% linked quarter. Purchases were primarily agency residential mortgage-backed securities and US treasuries. Our cash balances at the Fed averaged $20.7 billion for the second quarter, down $4.7 billion linked quarter and $1.4 billion year-over-year, as we continue to deploy our liquidity. ","Turning to Slide 6, deposits increased approximately $300 million linked quarter driven by growth in consumer deposits, partially offset by seasonally lower commercial deposits. Compared to the same period last year, deposits increased by $4.6 billion or 2%. ","As expected, deposit betas continued to increase in the second quarter. Our cumulative beta since December 2015 was 26%, up from 21% last quarter, while our current beta since March 2018 was 50%. Our expectation is that cumulative betas will continue to increase throughout the remainder of the year, particularly on the consumer side as they still lag stated levels. ","As you can see on Slide 7, net income in the second quarter was $1.4 billion. It was a strong quarter and we delivered positive operating leverage both in the second quarter and year-to-date. Revenue was up 5% linked quarter driven by growth in both net interest income and non-interest income. ","Non-interest expense increased 2% compared to the first quarter reflecting our continued focus on cost management. Provision for credit losses in the second quarter was $80 million, as overall credit quality remained strong. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 18.3% impacted by strong pretax earnings. For the full year 2018, we continue to expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 17%. ","Now let\u2019s assess the key drivers of this performance in more details. Turning to Slide 8, net interest income increased $52 million or 2% linked quarter and $155 million or 7% compared to the same period last year as growth in earning assets and higher yields were partially offset by higher funding costs. ","The linked quarter comparison also benefited from an additional day in the second quarter. Net interest margin was 2.96%, an increase of 5 basis points compared to the first quarter. Non-interest income increased 9% linked quarter and 6% year-over-year, as we remained focused on growing fee-based revenues. ","Importantly, fee income grew 5% linked quarter despite softness in residential mortgage. The main drivers of the $72 million linked quarter fees are as follows: corporate services fees increased $58 million or 14% reflecting higher M&A advisory, treasury management and loan syndication fees, as well as a benefit from commercial mortgage servicing rights. ","Consumer services fees increased $24 million or 7% largely due to seasonally higher customer activity in debit card, merchant services and credit cards. The growth in these categories was partially offset by lower residential mortgage non-interest income, which declined $13 million. Servicing fees decreased as a result of higher pay-off volumes, loan sales revenue also declined despite higher originations. ","Increased competition and a shift in mix away from refinancing to purchases pressured our gain on sale margins. Finally, other non-interest income of $334 million increased $89 million compared to the first quarter and included a $27 million net benefit from Visa fair value adjustments. ","Additionally, we had higher revenue from private equity investments and commercial mortgage loans held-for-sale activity. Going forward, we continue to expect the quarterly runrate for other non-interest income to be in the range of $225 million to $275 million excluding that security and Visa activity. ","Turning to Slide 9, second quarter expenses increased by $57 million or 2% linked quarter reflecting seasonally higher business activities and marketing. Our efficiency ratio was 60% in the second quarter, down both linked quarter and year-over-year. ","As you know, we have a goal to reduce costs through our continuous improvement program by $250 million in 2018 and we remain on track to achieve our full year target. In 2018, these savings which are across all expense categories are helping to offset higher personnel expenses related to new initiatives, as well as the increase in the minimum hourly wage commitments we made to our employees at the end of 2017. ","Our credit quality metrics are presented on Slide 10 and overall, we improved in every measure. Compared to the first quarter, total non-performing loans were down $123 million or 7% and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies were down $28 million or 2% linked quarter driven by a decline in consumer delinquencies past due 90-days or more. ","Provision for credit losses of $80 million decreased by $12 million linked quarter reflecting a lower provision for commercial loans. Net charge-offs declined $4 million linked quarter and were essentially unchanged year-over-year. In the second quarter, the annualized net charge-off ratio was 20 basis points down 1 basis point linked quarter. ","So in summary, PNC posted strong second quarter results. For the remainder of the year, we expect continued steady growth in GDP. We continue to expect one more 25 basis point increase in short-term interest rates this year, but we now expect it to occur in September rather than December. ","Looking ahead to third quarter of 2018, compared to second quarter 2018 reported results, we expect modest loan growth, we expect total net interest income to be up low single-digits, we expect fee income to be up low single-digits, we expect other non-interest income to be in the $225 million to $275 million range, we expect expenses to be stable and we expect provision to be between $100 million and $150 million. ","Taking into account our third quarter guidance, I would like to take this opportunity to refine our full year outlook. In light of our view on interest rate increases that I just mentioned, as well as a strong fee income performance we\u2019ve seen in the first half of the year which we expect to continue into the second half, we now expect full year total revenue to grow in the upper-end of the mid-single-digit range. ","Commensurate with our expectations for higher fee income, we now expect marginally higher full year expenses resulting in lower mid-single-digit growth. So to be clear, our full year 2018 guidance compared to adjusted 2017 results is as follows: we expect mid-single-digit loan growth; we expect upper mid-single-digit revenue growth; we expect expense growth in the low-end of the mid-single-digit range, and importantly, we remain positioned to deliver positive operating leverage in 2018. ","And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore Partners. The line is open. Please go ahead with your question.","John Pancari ","Good morning. ","William Demchak","Hey, John.","Robert Reilly","Hey, John.","John Pancari ","On the revenue growth outlook that you just mentioned, your rational in pushing at higher \u2013 is \u2013 I get the first part of the year so far in the, particularly the second quarter come in a little bit better, is the rest of it only the revision given your Fed outlook or is there still other strengthening in the back half of the year on the revenue front that you are factoring in now?","Robert Reilly","I\u2019d say, John, this is Rob. Good morning. I\u2019d say, it\u2019s all of the above. I mean, I think the important takeaway is, we are running a little higher to-date than we expected and we expect that to continue for all the reasons that you mentioned. ","John Pancari ","Okay. All right. And then, separately, on the loan demand side, just want to see if you can talk a little bit about what you are seeing. I know you indicated that, paydowns are still elevated in commercial real estate. Wondering what you are seeing in terms of demand on the commercial side and do you expect any impact related to the trade wars and presenting your loan growth outlook was unchanged despite any maybe underlying improvement we are seeing in CapEx for example? Thanks. ","Robert Reilly","Yes, I\u2019d say \u2013 I\u2019d say that, when we look at the second half of the year, as I mentioned, the pipelines for loan and C&IB credits is healthy. I think the big change and nothing due this quarter, but the big change over the last couple of years has been the CRE component which is on slot. ","But corporate banking or middle market, the pipeline is healthy, our business credit secured businesses, specialty businesses all look pretty good. Large corporate, not as strong as it was and we think in part that\u2019s due to some of the cash repatriation and some of the tax reforms. But I\u2019d say generally speaking, it looks healthy. ","William Demchak","And notwithstanding all the news on trade, it doesn\u2019t seem to be showing up in the sales pipeline or loan demand or even in dialogue with clients. There is obviously a handful who are impacted maybe more than that, but as subtracting that when we look at our pipeline it doesn\u2019t seem to be playing into it at this point. ","John Pancari ","That\u2019s right. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Your line is open. Please go ahead. ","John McDonald ","Hi, good morning guys. Wanted to ask a little bit about the rates in the curve, the bank stock have really been weighed down by the flattening 2 to 10 investors focus on that. This quarter we saw you benefit from higher short rates and you put cash to work kind of in the mid to longer-end. ","So I am kind of wondering where is the curve relevant for you and where is it not relevant, kind of how you think about this kind of curve debate that\u2019s happening relative to your fundamentals? ","William Demchak","I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a debate. As the curve flattens, it ultimately hurts us and we benefit from floating rate loans as LIBOR goes up but our yield on invested securities to the extent the ten year keeps trading inside of three years, it suffers. ","We did increased securities this year, but I would tell you some amount of the duration from that was offsetting interest rate swaps that we unwound which helps on that yield front as well. But I, at the end of the day, if we hang around some range bound around 3% on the ten year, we are going to see our securities portfolio track that. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. ","Erika Najarian ","Hi, good morning. ","William Demchak","Good morning. ","Erika Najarian ","The one question I\u2019ve gotten to most from your investors recently is, on the buybacks. I think everybody got the message, Bill and Rob that you wanted to focus on the dividend, but I guess, they are wondering would be open to the de minimis option where you could repurchase 25% of your Tier-1 capital without an additional ask in the CCAR cycle?","William Demchak","That\u2019s a new rule. 25% of your Tier-1 capital without\u2026","Erika Najarian ","Oh sorry, 25 basis points.","William Demchak","Saying, yes. ","Erika Najarian ","25 basis points. So not 25%. So just dialing that down. ","William Demchak","Look, at this point, we just got done on the CCAR process. So we will take a look at it, of course if they also put in a commentary that you can resubmit if you want it. And we\u2019ll watch our play through the course of the year. ","The one thing I would say on the buybacks, the other question you guys have relayed to us is, are we saving capital for some sort of acquisition, and the answer to that is no. So at the end of the day, whether we do a little bit more this year or we do extra next year, holding capital and not doing anything stupid with it, but vesting in our business. ","It\u2019s a good thing. And we have a lot of \u2013 you\u2019ve heard us talk about growth opportunities inside the company itself. So, we\u2019ll look at it as the year goes on as to whether we resubmit our use of de minimis and the other stuff, but in the mean time we are not going to do anything silly with your capital. ","Robert Reilly","And we do see the current share price as attractive. ","William Demchak","Yes, yes. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Please go ahead with your question.","Scott Siefers ","Good morning guys. Just I was hoping you could touch a bit on the provision in guidance and I guess we are sort of getting back into that phenomenon where even though $100 million to $150 million range looks \u2013 starts to look kind of conservative. Just, I mean, how strong the trends are so. I was hoping you could chat a little about what it would take to get you back into that range and just overall trends broadly?","William Demchak","One of the things you have to keep in mind and the reason we kind of have it higher than we are printing is it\u2019s so low now that single credits can impact it. So, we could have a blip on a few credits go in a quarter and put us back in that range pretty easily. ","And even that range that we are guiding to right now is below what you would expect sort of on average through the cycle. So we are just at really low levels and maybe we are conservative in saying we\u2019ll be a little higher and it keeps surprising ourselves. And it takes a tiny blip to move us. ","Robert Reilly","Yes, that\u2019s right. Scott, this is Rob. We are just working of such at low absolute levels that literally, particularly in the commercial portfolio, literally a deal or two moving in either direction can affect the range. And so, that\u2019s a good thing and a good place to be, but it does \u2013 that makes the guidance\u2026","William Demchak","Around a low number. ","Robert Reilly","That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. ","Betsy Graseck ","Hey good morning. ","William Demchak","Hey, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck ","Question on just \u2013 as we are thinking about NIM outlook and trajectory, I know we talked about the deposit beta side and asset yields, could you give us a little color on how you are thinking about the non-deposit funding and is there, any type of mix shift we could see you do there over time is there any kind of restructuring that you might consider? ","Those cost of funds came up quite a bit in the past couple of quarters and then maybe there is an opportunity there to restructure that and flow the uptick in cost of funds on that side of the balance sheet?","William Demchak","I am not sure I follow, I mean, the cost of funds increase is just to related to the increase in LIBOR as much as anything else as we swap effectively our wholesale borrowings back into floating. So it hasn\u2019t gone up on sort of a relative cost basis other than the impact on interest rates and of course net-net we benefit from that increase in rates on our floating rate loan portfolio. So now I don\u2019t see us to get and see any opportunity. ","Robert Reilly","Or need to shift trends. ","William Demchak","Yes. ","Betsy Graseck ","Okay, and like on \u2013 just the mix between sub debt or senior debt or FHLB or other borrowed, there is no need to mix that up at all?","William Demchak","We are in a pretty good place. ","Betsy Graseck ","Okay. Just to follow-up on the digital banking strategy, I know you have \u2013 you are rolling that out. Could you give us a sense as to where you are really pushing that more than others, because it feels like, as you roll that out it\u2019s a marketing push and I am just worrying you are really doing it on a nation-wide basis or is it specific MSAs that you are focused on for us?","William Demchak","Well, it will be enabled as a function of specific geographies and zip codes, both the ability to find it and search and then ultimately to open an account and move money. We do that purposely, so we don\u2019t in effect could contagion bank with our existing markets. At launch, it will be basically available on a national basis in all markets where we currently don\u2019t have core branch presence. ","We will focus our marketing efforts on a few select markets which we\u2019ll announce sometime over the next month probably, that will be obvious to you when we do it. So it will be available basically on a national basis, but we\u2019ll focus on markets where we already have a presence just not retail and where we are actually building branches just in a very thin network relative to \u2026","Robert Reilly","To complement that effort.","William Demchak","Yes. ","Betsy Graseck ","Got it. And so that would include Boston and Phoenix that you announced that you are going to\u2026","William Demchak","Eventually, they will be our\u2026","Betsy Graseck ","Okay.","William Demchak","Early ones. ","Betsy Graseck ","Got it. ","William Demchak","It will be available there day one, you won\u2019t see billboards and branches.","Robert Reilly","It\u2019s in physical. ","William Demchak","Now in the Fed. ","Betsy Graseck ","And then how do you measure success in those types of markets?","William Demchak","That\u2019s a fair question. I think, at this point, and you\u2019ve heard me talk about this, what we are doing is chasing deposits with a low and effect marginal cost to them, because we don\u2019t have a big physical plan cost associated with the deposits come in. ","So, it doesn\u2019t take much to offset the cost of what we\u2019ll deploy in marketing in the small branch build and I would think, given the offering we\u2019ll have the simplicity at the linkage to the rest of the bank and our brand that we ought to be able to grow that deposit base at least as quickly as some of the other larger digital players that you see out there. ","Betsy Graseck ","Okay, and the pricing on the deposits?","William Demchak","It\u2019s going to be competitive. ","Betsy Graseck ","Okay. ","Robert Reilly","And we are looking to learn. ","Betsy Graseck ","Okay. ","Robert Reilly","Looking. ","William Demchak","I mean, I think part of \u2013 part of this is, the trend is definitely moving towards digital account opening to digital deposits and the ability to pay higher rates with a low cost base behind it. I don\u2019t think anybody knows that the actual at which this is going to grow and when and if you get a convergence between digital deposit pricing and what we pay in core accounts is within the rest of the network. ","So, we are going to kind of test and learn and by the way we will do it somewhat differently in each market as it relates to the way we spend marketing dollars and we\u2019ll see what happens and we\u2019ll report back as we learn. ","Betsy Graseck ","And the competitive is competitive versus the online deposit gatherers?","William Demchak","Yes. ","Betsy Graseck ","Yes, okay. All right. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. ","William Demchak","Yes. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead. ","Gerard Cassidy ","Good morning, Bill. Good morning, Rob. ","William Demchak","Good morning. ","Robert Reilly","Hey, Gerard. ","Gerard Cassidy ","Can you guys give us a little more color in the other revenue category? You touched on the private equity gains in generating that revenue. The number was up nicely. Can you give us a little more detail of what\u2019s in there and what was private equity, maybe one-time in nature?","Robert Reilly","Yes, sure. Gerard, this is Rob. The other category includes a lot of various line items, but the three biggest drivers tend to be private equity, asset sales and CDA. So in this quarter, as we mentioned, private equity had a very strong performance and then on top of that, we had the Visa valuation adjustment. So, those were the really the two big drivers. ","We guide to 225 to 275, because that\u2019s where it tends to be on average, but because of the lumpiness of that category can be higher in one quarter and lower in the next and this quarter it was just higher. ","Gerard Cassidy ","I see. Thank you. And then, in the follow-up on your conversation on digital, have you guys figured out or do you have a sense of, we know a lot of folks go and purchase savings accounts or money market funds on \u2013 through the digital channel, but opening up checking accounts seems to be maybe a little bit more of a hurdle. ","Have you guys done any \u2013 I know, it\u2019s not going to be rolled out until later this year, but what\u2019s your guys thinking of actually new customers opening, checking accounts online through the digital channel, what kind of success you might have this time next year? ","Robert Reilly","That\u2019s the big unknown question. We have spent a lot of time on the design and simplicity by which you can first open a high-yield savings account and then ultimately convert it to a virtual wallet account and we believe as evidenced by the fact, we are going to go in and build this branch to network that we will have some amount of success with that. But that\u2019s what we are going to have to figure out. ","The research basically says, if there is in excess of 60% of consumers who are comfortable with a largely digital relationship with their bank subject to sort of a thin presence giving them some amount of comfort that they can go in a building screen that something \u2013 screen to somebody if we guess something wrong. ","But we are going to, we\u2019ve set it up to the best of our ability. We are going to test and learn and we\u2019ll see through times. My own belief is that over time, we will see that exceeds. I just don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to take and you are actually correct that thus far people haven\u2019t been able to do that to a much extent. ","Gerard Cassidy ","Great. Thank you very much. ","Robert Reilly","Yes. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead. ","Ken Usdin ","Thanks. Good morning guys. Rob, on the securities portfolio, I noticed that obviously you had put a lot of the liquidity to work. I wanted to ask you 291 average yield, what are you finding? What your new money yield is coming on at and how much more remix into securities out of cash? Do you still have the ability to do especially with \u2013a still quite attractive loan-to-deposit ratio? Thanks. ","William Demchak","Sure, Ken. In regard to the securities book in terms of what we are purchasing you can see is, residential agencies and treasuries, in total new adds are higher than the 291 around the 3% level, which is why you\u2019ve seen some of that movement. ","We still have a lot of liquidity, the $20 billion, approximately $20 billion or so with the Federal which could be moved into by definition into high quality level 1 securities. So, we still have a lot of flexibility. We will continue to deploy more money on a tactical basis. ","Ken Usdin ","Okay, great. And then, one question on just the regulatory outlook. The great bill didn\u2019t have a lot to offer banks of your size, any incremental hopes of what might come down in the pike that you might see some benefits from down the road or hopes that you might see?","William Demchak","Yes, Governor \u2013 has made a lot of public comments separately in conversation with some of the industry groups. They, at some point intend to put out what I think will be a more scaled approach to both LCR and some of the thin bucket items. ","So effectively the things impacted by Basel II and the hard line at $250 billion, my hope would be to see that they would in effect rather than have for example on LCR at 70 and a 100, they would instead sort of scale that number as a function of asset size and other measures of complexity rather than have a binary trigger to certain dollar amount and all the body language out of the Fed suggested they are going to something like that. ","Robert Reilly","And obviously, we are receptive to that the more the tailoring approach versus the - a sheer simple asset size. ","Bryan Gill","Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Please go ahead. ","Kevin Barker ","Good morning. ","William Demchak","Hey, Kevin.","Robert Reilly","Hey, Kevin.","Kevin Barker ","And Rob, you made a mention that the consumer \u2013 I mean, deposit betas are expected to accelerate through the rest of this year, even though they\u2019ve accelerated quite a bit here in the second quarter from the first quarter up to 40%. So you have made this. ","Robert Reilly","Yes. ","Kevin Barker ","Is that catch-up in the back half of the year and do you expect it to go above 50% as we move through the second half?","Robert Reilly","Yes, I think, catch-up is probably a good word and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve put that chart, we break that chart in between current betas and cumulative betas. So, what changed this quarter was across commercial and consumer and a result total, our current betas went above our stated betas. ","But you can see on the cumulative beta we are still lagging. So, I do see \u2013 I see some acceleration on the current beta which by definition will pull up the cumulative beta, but the cumulative just moves a little slower.","Kevin Barker ","Okay. And then, given the outlook for rates in the back half of this year and given your revenue guidance, it implies that probably have quite a bit of acceleration in loan growth combined with a little bit of expansion in NIM. ","Are you assuming that deposit betas and borrowing funds continue to grow or at least move higher at the same rate that we saw in the first half of this year?","Robert Reilly","Well, what I\u2019d say to make it easy is, in terms of our guidance for the year, that\u2019s all those thoughts are baked into that. A lot of moving parts there, but that\u2019s our best estimate.","Kevin Barker ","Okay. Thank you very much. ","Robert Reilly","Sure. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Your line is open. Please go ahead. ","Brian Klock ","Good morning guys. ","Robert Reilly","Hey, Brian. ","William Demchak","Good morning. ","Brian Klock ","And so, I want to follow-up a little bit on the deposit side, not the beta question, but just overall balances and looking at the end of period spots balances. So it looks like the DDA balances have been declining since the third quarter of 2016 roughly and were over $82 billion at the end of the third quarter 2016, now it\u2019s $79 billion and then down about 1% year-over-year. ","So, Bill, are you seeing commercial companies shifting into \u2013 they try to get some rate, I mean, I guess, is there conversations of customers about earnings credit or some of those deposits actually going out of the system and being used.","William Demchak","I mean, I guess a couple things. Look, the net liquidity into this system from QE has been gradually dropping, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s impacting us. What you are seeing is in shift, both on the consumer and the corporate side, the interest-bearing where they can get it. So lazy money is moving and that\u2019s not really a surprise to anybody. ","Brian Klock ","Got you. And then, do you have the mix \u2013 the interest-bearing deposit growth kind of help to move total deposit growth? And do you have the mix of how much of that\u2019s in the CDs versus the money market accounts?","William Demchak","It\u2019s still predominantly money market. We\u2019ve \u2013 I think just last quarter, Rob, started getting a little more aggressive, sort of 18 months to two year CDs. ","Robert Reilly","But it\u2019s a still small but active and contrast to what it\u2019s been the last handful of years.","William Demchak","Yes. ","Brian Klock ","Got it. Okay, thanks. And then, I guess, just as a follow-up, on the expense guide, it seems like the fourth quarter guidance, if I plug a number, maybe it\u2019s down 10 million or 15 million from what you are guiding for the third quarter and it seems like the FDIC surcharge, and we took an estimate of something in the neighborhood of 30% to 40% that could be benefiting your fourth quarter. ","So do you guys \u2013 are you including a potential for that surcharge to go way in the fourth quarter in your guidance or I guess, what are your thoughts if you are including and what are your thoughts on sort of reinvesting that savings?","Robert Reilly","Well, in terms of our expense guidance for the balance of the year, we took it up a little bit commensurate with the higher revenue activity that we saw and we estimate a handicap. Events that might occur including a FDIC relief which isn\u2019t assured and then we blend that all into \u2013 we blend that into our estimates.","Brian Klock ","You are giving us a way too much credit for being exact. ","Robert Reilly","We have 60 items - see different things \u2013 there is a lot going on. ","William Demchak","Trying to give you our best shot.","Robert Reilly","Lot going on within approximate $10 billion spend. ","Brian Klock ","That\u2019s a fair play. Thank you guys. Thanks for your time. ","Robert Reilly","Sure. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead with your question. ","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, hi. This is Rob from Matt\u2019s team. Treasury matters have seemed especially strong this quarter. I know this is a business you\u2019ve been pretty positive on and have highlighted in prior presentations, but any color you can provide on the strength this quarter? And then maybe just the outlook for that business going forward?","William Demchak","I mean, nothing unusual, it\u2019s just working. If anything you are probably seeing an acceleration as we cross-sell into the some of the newer clients we\u2019ve gotten out of the Southeast and get a greater proportion of fees from relationships that we sort of started through a credit relationship, but the offering is the offering. We continue invest pretty heavily in technology-based solutions for our clients and it\u2019s working. ","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then separately, you borrowing costs were up meaningfully again this quarter, presumably on the widening on the day LIBOR spread on an average basis. That said, that spread has come in bit more recently, given that, should we expect that to be benefit in 3Q or have you guys start to swap that out at all? I know you have mentioned on the last call. ","William Demchak","I mean, the borrowing cost again are up largely because of LIBOR broadly to find rates up and we did in fact, hedge out a fair chunk in a basis between threes ones over the course of the last four, five months I guess. So I don\u2019t know that you\u2019d see any impact going into the third quarter beyond whatever. ","Robert Reilly","I can jump in there to \u2013 so we pointed that out in the first earnings call that mostly just \u2013 not because just its size relative to our total NII, it\u2019s just that it was a bit of a surprise and we weren\u2019t sure at that time whether it was going to persist for the year. So we wanted to identify it. ","I think when we got into second quarter that Bill mentioned, we were able to move on a tactical basis to some one month index and then also to your point it did \u2013 the gap narrowed and it narrowed in a good way with one month LIBOR going up, three months LIBOR seeing relatively flat, because we benefit from that from our loan book. That whole issue bottom-line subsided substantially quarter-over-quarter. ","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thanks for the color. ","Robert Reilly","Sure. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski from Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead. ","Chris Kotowski ","Yes, good morning. I guess, looking at the trading action in your stock and mostly other banks, it seems to me everyone is concerned about the rising deposit betas and the flattening yield curve, but I guess when I stand back and look at a big picture, I see 2.9% year-over-year loan growth and 6.9% net interest income growth. ","And so, clearly you are still getting a very significant benefit and I assume most of that is coming from the free funds, the demand deposits, equity and other float and I guess, what needs to \u2013 when does a further Fed rate increase not become a benefit? I mean, it just seems to me, you\u2019d have to have an extreme view of deposit betas or curve in order for a further Fed increase \u2013 Fed hikes not to have a beneficial impact for you?","William Demchak","I think that\u2019s right. I don\u2019t know it\u2019s interesting to watch as people talk about betas. Remember if our deposit betas, 50% make up a number here that\u2019s beyond our stated beta and the Fed goes by another 25 basis points, we get 12.5 basis points.","Chris Kotowski ","Yes. ","William Demchak","Every time, so, on top of what we are carrying into it with a cumulative beta of wherever we are at this point. So, I don\u2019t particularly understand that logic of course, betas were going to accelerate in a simple notion that you build a gap between what you are paying and where the Fed is. And then you gradually get to pace with where the Fed is maintaining that gap the whole time. ","So it doesn\u2019t get worse. The other thing in our case, we are not an NII shop. We like it when rates go up and we make more money, but we continue to grow fees at a pace that has an opportunity at least as great as what we do in NII through time and it\u2019s less volatile and less dependent on the environment. So, I \u2013 the market will do what it will do. ","Robert Reilly","We tend to agree with you. ","Chris Kotowski ","Yes. I mean, just it\u2019s still a benefit, right. It\u2019s all still \u2013 and I mean, I guess, I think it seems to me most bank kind of business models were kind of calibrated in an environment where in short rates were like between 3% and 6%, I mean, that was kind of historically the normal range and we are still below that. I mean, would you say? ","William Demchak","I was just going to say, the one fear that could be out there is, just to what extent people have fixed rate assets that ultimately \u2013 because mortgage is quick prepaying and so forth that you just lose carry-on. Right, so the balance sheet ends up being constrained by legacy fixed rate assets as they raise the front-end of the curve, you can see margins contract. That isn\u2019t our case. ","Chris Kotowski ","All right. Thank you. That\u2019s it for me. ","William Demchak","Sure. ","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Your line is open. Please go ahead. ","Marty Mosby ","Thank you. Bill, I want to ask you about the loan growth. Given the competition that we are seeing in pricing and maybe some underwriting loosening, are you really kind of, Bill, kind of keeping the PNC legacy that in this part of the cycle when you start to see that growing half of what the market is growing is probably the right position to be in?","William Demchak","We don\u2019t purposely throttle our growth one way or the other. We maintain the credit box that we always have. So, if a deal works for us, it works for us. We\u2019ll compete on the price and in fact, for the last several quarters, we\u2019ve seen spreads stay pretty constant where this quarter we saw them come in a couple of basis points on average. ","So we are not necessarily tightening credit and we are just not loosening credit to chase and that means that all else equal we win less deals in competition which is why total growth is both down. But that\u2019s most apparent in CRE where we coming out of the crisis, we had quite strong growth that it\u2019s tapered off over time as that market in our view has gotten overheated. ","Marty Mosby ","And then Rob, I got two questions for you. If you look at where the yield curve kind of lays out right now, the flatness between the two and ten, but yet still a big kind of cliff down to the short rates, that steepness of the curve, you get all the benefit from going from one day or one month, one or two years, you don't have to take much duration and you get all the benefit. ","Is that part of why you began to deploy some of that liquidity, because it almost becomes a no brainer to create something with that much cash flow that shorter duration and get that much benefit? And then, lastly, when the mortgage fees start to work again? I mean, we watch this whole cycle waiting on that business to kind of kick in and we just haven\u2019t gotten yet. ","Robert Reilly","I would just comment on the rates. I mean, your comment is exactly right. You go twos, tens, you get an extra twenty basis points. You\u2019d have to really buy into a big curve inversion with 10-year rallying from here to want to do that. So, and that\u2019s part of what we are doing. ","Marty Mosby ","That\u2019s right. ","Robert Reilly","On mortgages, look, volume is down, where our purchase volume versus refi is north of 60%, 70%, ","William Demchak","30%, 70%, yes, yes, in the purchasing.","Robert Reilly","And so, with that much capacity in the market, you are basically relying on purchase volume you are going to see margin squeezed. ","Marty Mosby ","Do you hope that the mortgage activity kind of kicks in as we get home formation picking up again?","William Demchak","It is always a hope. ","Robert Reilly","Yes. ","William Demchak","I mean, beyond our \u2013 beyond the market overall, we would like to believe that given the changes we\u2019ve made in our technology around mortgage that we would do better on a share basis through time independent on what the market itself does. But we are in a fairly tough market for mortgages and you are seeing that in everybody\u2019s results. ","Robert Reilly","And perhaps, Marty, you are right. Mortgage is obviously a smaller component and it\u2019s a strategic product need for us. We want to be able to do it for our customers. So, I think the Refi wait is over for a while, so to Bill\u2019s point we just have to set ourselves up for further purchase volume. ","Marty Mosby ","Thanks. ","William Demchak","Sure. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead. ","Mike Mayo ","Hi, I had a follow-up on the national digital bank. So, did I hear you right you are creating a national digital bank, you are going to really focus on a few select markets and in those few select markets you\u2019ll eventually be opening up bank branches?","William Demchak","Yes, in fact, it\u2019s pretty much concurrent with the launch, we\u2019ll open a handful of branches. I mean, it will be a very, very thin network, it won\u2019t look like any of our traditional retail markets. But we think you get \u2013 you have the potential for a much broader set of consumers to the extent you have physical presence in brand and the trust that comes with that as you launch digital. ","Mike Mayo ","And I think this is the first time PNC has ever expanded retail de novo to new markets and I am just wondering what gives you extra confidence at this stage of the corporate lifecycle to do that and I am also noticing your marketing spend was up one-third quarter-over-quarter, does that increase your marketing spend related to the new expansion?","William Demchak","Somewhat related to the new expansion. Look, we are \u2013 banking has changed. The ability to go de novo into a new market, you are right, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever done it, but the way we\u2019ve never really done it on the C&IB side either and that\u2019s going game busters and then trailing that with the digital retail offering on the back of the brand presence that will get with the regional president model, the local marketing, the local presence, we think it works. ","You now have the ability through digital marketing and social media to get brand awareness for a thin branch network in a way that you just didn\u2019t have available twenty years ago. ","Mike Mayo ","So, should we think of \u2013 well, first, I guess, you didn\u2019t identify the cities, I am going to guess it\u2019s \u2013 it might be Dallas, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Denver, Houston, Nashville. In other words, does it make sense?","William Demchak","[A fewer throw and odd, sets riding.] ","Mike Mayo ","Okay. So it\u2019s kind of like, Goldman Sachs markets, but with branches or?","Robert Reilly","Yes, that\u2019s right. ","William Demchak","Yes, that\u2019s right, because we are \u2013 so, priority number one, Mike, we want to be able to find a different channel to grow deposits, because right now, we have national loan growth capability against regional funding. So long, long-term we have been in balance there. Right, so, simply to high yield savings product is a good way for us to grow some stable deposits through time. ","But beyond that, because we have such a powerful platform in our virtual wallet product and the brand, we think we have a shot at least as good as anybody in converting those high-yield savings accounts into full PNC relationships with these customers and we spend a lot of time building the technology that\u2019s going to make it very simple for somebody to convert those accounts. ","And that the handful of branches that we might have in a market, just is kind of the tipping stone to give somebody comfort that they are not dealing with the person behind the curtain here that there is actually a presence of go and talk to somebody if they need to. ","Mike Mayo ","Last follow-up. I can see why you\u2019d have an advantage to stay against some fin tech firm in Silicon valley, I mean, you have the expertise with consumer banking. On the other hand, I mean, going against an incumbent in their backyard, just like if someone were to come to Pittsburgh trying to get the consumers away from you, isn\u2019t that a tough challenge?","William Demchak","Yes and no. So we are going to offer into that market including the customers that convert to a full relationship, a full digital price. Right, so the yield that we offer on savings products in these markets will be as high as than any of the online banks today and we will have with that, we\u2019ll augment that with a handful of branches. ","So, when they convert to virtual wallet, that savings product inside a virtual wallet will offer this online rate. So in a world where rates are no longer zero, and that makes it a big difference to be. ","Mike Mayo ","All right, we\u2019ll keep a close watch. Thank you.","William Demchak","So will we. ","Operator","And there are no further questions. ","Bryan Gill","Okay, well, thank you very much for participating on the call. ","William Demchak","Thanks everybody. ","Robert Reilly","Thank you. ","Operator","And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. "],"17078":["PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

My name is Carlos and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The PNC Financial Services Group Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Bryan Gill. Sir, please go ahead.","Bryan Gill","Thank you, operator, and good morning. Welcome to today\u2019s conference call for The PNC Financial Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Demchak; and Rob Reilly, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today\u2019s presentation contains forward-looking information. Our forward-looking statements regarding PNC performance assume a continuation of the current economic trends and do not take into account the impact of potential, legal and regulatory contingencies. Actual results and future events could differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in our statements and from historical performance due to a variety of risks and other factors.","Information about such factors, as well as GAAP reconciliations and other information on non-GAAP financial measures we discuss, is included in today\u2019s conference call, earnings release and related presentation materials and in our 10-K, 10-Qs and various other SEC filings and investor materials. These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under investor relations. These statements speak only as of October 14, 2016, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Bill Demchak.","William Demchak","Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. I know everybody has a fairly busy morning this morning with all the earnings out, so I\u2019m going to keep my comments very brief before I turn it over to Rob to take you through the numbers.","Just to lead off, as you\u2019ve seen this morning, PNC reported net income of $1 billion, or $1.84 per diluted common share in the third quarter. You hopefully also saw it was a good, clean quarter with results that are kind of representative of the consistent execution our shareholders have come to expect from us in recent years.","We grew loans by more than $1 billion, generated strong deposit growth. We had revenue up by $35 million, or 1%, driven by both higher net interest income and noninterest income. And we had expenses \u2013 expenses again remained well controlled, and importantly, overall credit quality remained stable with the second quarter.","Finally, and just briefly, I can assure you that we\u2019re hard at work on the execution of the growth drivers that we laid out at the recent Barclays Conference. While the bulk of our consumer lending initiatives are going to take some time to execute, we\u2019ve already started putting together the teams for the C&IB growth markets, and in fact already have Dallas up and running.","And with that brief update, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rob, who is going to take you through a closer look at the numbers, and then of course, we\u2019ll be happy to answer your questions at the end. Rob?","Robert Reilly","Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. PNC\u2019s third quarter net income was $1 billion, or $1.84 per diluted common share. These results reflected revenue growth, driven by higher net interest income and fee income. Expenses remained well-managed and our provision declined.","Balance sheet information is on Slide 4, and is presented on an average basis. Commercial lending was up $597 million from the second quarter, reflecting growth in our large corporate client and our real estate businesses. Consumer lending was essentially flat linked quarter. We did see growth in auto, residential mortgage, and credit card, which totaled approximately $400 million during the second quarter. However, that was offset by declines in the non-strategic consumer portfolio and government guaranteed education loans.","Looking at our securities portfolio, we saw growth on both in average and spot basis, which was commensurate with a higher level of deposit. On average \u2013 on an average basis, investment securities increased linked quarter by $1.5 billion, or 2%, and total deposits increased by $4.9 billion, which was also 2%. On a spot basis, investment securities increased by $6.7 billion or 9%, and total deposits increased by $10.1 billion or 4%.","Securities purchases were primarily residential mortgage-backed and treasuries, a portion of which settled late in the third quarter resulting in the increase in spot balances relative to average. Importantly, our asset sensitivity was not significantly impacted during the quarter as a third of the purchases were converted to floating-rate.","Average shareholders\u2019 equity increased by approximately $200 million linked quarter, as we continue to return substantial capital to shareholders. During the third quarter, our capital return totaled $772 million, comprised of $499 million in share repurchases, and $273 million in common dividends. This resulted in a payout ratio of approximately 85%.","Period-end common shares outstanding were $488 million, down $22 million or 4% compared to the same time a year ago. As of September 30, 2016, our pro forma Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio fully phased-in and using the standardized approach was estimated to be 10.2%, which was unchanged from June 30, 2016. Our tangible book value reached $67.93 per common share as of September 30, a 7% increase compared to the same time a year ago. And our return on average assets for the third quarter was 1.1%.","As I have already mentioned and as you can see on Slide 5, net income was $1 billion, and highlights include the following. Total revenue was up $35 million compared to the second quarter, driven by higher net interest income, which increased $27 million in part due to an additional day in the quarter.","Noninterest income was up in the quarter, as business activity and improved equity markets drove fee income growth of $13 million. As expected, expenses continued to be well-managed. Noninterest expense increased by $34 million or 1% compared to the second quarter, reflecting increased business activity and the impact of the new FDIC surcharge.","Provision for credit losses in the third quarter was $87 million, down $40 million compared with the second quarter related to the stabilization in our energy-related loan portfolio. The non-energy component of provision, which was essentially all of our provision in the third quarter, was up $6 million compared to the second quarter, reflecting the gradual normalization of credit costs.","Finally, our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 25.4%. For the full-year 2016, we continue to expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. Now, I will discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail.","Turning to Slide 6, net interest income increased by $27 million or 1% compared to the second quarter. Core net interest income increased by $29 million, which was driven by an additional day in the quarter and higher earning assets that were partially offset by lower securities yields. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, core net interest income increased $61 million, or 3% and included higher securities and loan balances and higher loan yields.","Net interest margin of 2.68% declined by 2 basis points linked quarter, primarily reflecting the lower securities yields. Purchase accounting accretion was essentially flat linked quarter, as cash recoveries were higher than expected. For the fourth quarter, we expect purchase accounting accretion to be approximately $50 million.","Turning to Slide 7, noninterest income and importantly fee income grew over the second quarter. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, total noninterest income grew despite a sizable decline in other income. Year-over-year, we saw strong fee income growth of $77 million, or 6%, reflecting the continued success of our efforts across our businesses.","Asset management fees, which include our equity investment in BlackRock increased by 7%, both year-over-year and linked quarter, reflecting stronger equity markets and new business activity. Consumer services fees remained relatively stable linked quarter. Compared to the third quarter of last year, consumer services fees increased by $7 million, or 2%, primarily due to higher customer activity with growth in credit and debit cards.","Corporate services fees declined by $14 million, or 3% compared to the second quarter, as higher treasury management fees were offset by lower capital markets related revenue and a lower benefit from commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation. Compared to the third quarter of last year, corporate services fees grew by $5 million, or 1%, due to increased customer activity, which included higher treasury management and merger and acquisition advisory fees.","Residential mortgage noninterest income declined by $5 million, or 3% linked quarter as higher loan sales revenue driven by an increase in origination volume was offset by lower net hedging gains on mortgage servicing rights and lower servicing fees. Mortgage originations increased by 17% linked quarter.","Compared to the same quarter a year ago, residential mortgage noninterest income increased by $35 million, or 28% as a result of higher loan sales revenue from increased origination volumes, higher servicing revenue, and higher net hedging gains.","Service charges on deposits increased by $11 million, or 7% linked quarter, primarily due to seasonal customer activity. On a year-over-year basis, service charges on deposits remained relatively stable. Of note, with respect to other noninterest income, we had no sales of Visa shares in the third quarter. The year-over-year decline reflected the impact of the net Visa gains in the third quarter of 2015.","Turning to Slide 8. As you know, our expenses have declined three years in a row. And through the first three quarters of this year, expenses have remained well-managed, as we continue to invest in technology and business infrastructure. Third quarter expenses increased by $34 million, or 1%, which included increased business activity, as well as higher FDIC expenses of approximately $25 million, driven by the impact of the new surcharge.","As we previously stated, our continuous improvement program has a goal to reduce cost by $400 million in 2016. We\u2019re now nine months into the year and we\u2019ve completed actions related to capturing more than 75% of our annual goal. As a result, we remain confident we will achieve our full-year objectives. Through this program, we intend to partially fund the significant investments in our business.","Looking ahead, our fourth quarter will be impacted by seasonally higher expenses, which is consistent with prior years. We will also continue to make investments in technology, in our retail banking, and home lending transformation. As a result, we expect fourth quarter expenses to be up low single digits on a percentage basis compared to the third quarter. We continue to expect that our full-year 2016 expenses will remain stable with 2015 levels.","As you can see on Slide 9, overall credit quality was stable compared to the second quarter. While we experienced stabilization in our energy-related portfolio in the third quarter, our credit quality was impacted by these loans in recent quarters. And as a result, we are continuing to provide the breakout of this portfolio.","Total nonperforming loans decreased by 118 million, or 5% linked quarter, with declines across nearly all commercial and consumer categories. Total delinquencies decreased by $5 million compared to the second quarter. Provision for credit losses of $87 million decreased by $40 million linked quarter.","Our third quarter provision included $2 million for loans in our energy sector compared to $48 million in the second quarter. The remaining $85 million of our provision for our non-energy loans included the impact of increases on the consumer side, offset by a lower commercial provision, which was driven in part by changes in expected default rates. Because of the stabilization in our energy portfolio, we expect our fourth quarter provision to be in the $75 million to $125 million range.","Net charge offs increased $20 million, or $154 million in the third quarter. Higher commercial loan net charge-offs across various industries were partially offset by lower charge-offs related to loans in the energy sector. Our third quarter annualized net charge-off ratio was 29 basis points, up 3 basis points from the second quarter.","Turning to our energy book on Slide 10, not much has changed from the information provided last quarter. At the end of the third quarter, our oil, gas and coal portfolios continue to represent a small portion of our outstanding loans, approximately 1.4%, and we view this book as appropriately reserved. And as we stated previously, we continue to monitor market conditions, as well as impacts other businesses.","Borrowing any dramatic changes in energy prices, we believe the majority of the energy-related credit pressures we\u2019ve experienced in 2016 have largely subsided. In summary, PNC had a successful quarter, driven by growth in revenue and well-managed expenses. We grew loans and deposits and continued to deliver significant shareholder returns. We believe the U.S. economy will continue to grow at a steady pace, and our plans assume a 25 basis point increase in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve in December.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter and when compared to the third quarter reported results, we expect modest growth in loans, we expect stable net interest income, we expect stable fee income, we expect expenses to be up in the low single digits, and as I stated earlier, we expect provision to be between $75 million and $125 million.","With that Bill and I are ready to take your questions.","Bryan Gill","Operator, could you poll for questions please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Sure. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Siefers","Good morning, guys.","William Demchak","Good morning.","Robert Reilly","Hi, Scott.","Scott Siefers","Rob, I wonder within the sort of theme of the stable fee income, I look for the fourth quarter. Can you just\u2026","Robert Reilly","Yes.","Scott Siefers","\u2026maybe go through it a little bit of the puts and takes, I mean, I imagine mortgage begins to kind of normalize off sort of elevated levels. But what are sort of the big factors you see pro and con?","Robert Reilly","Yes. So, the guidance overall is for stable fee income, Scott. Within those components, we see asset management and consumer services up a bit. Corporate services and residential mortgage maybe down a little bit. Corporate services, because of the elevated M&A fees and residential mortgage more due to seasonality and a little bit of drop off in the refinancing volume.","Scott Siefers","Okay, perfect. I appreciate that.","Robert Reilly","Sure.","Scott Siefers","And then, Bill, maybe just a quick question for you. A lot has been made about this \u2013 the slowdown in commercial lending from the H8 data the last couple of months. Just curious if you can provide a little bit expanded outlook on sort of the trends you\u2019re seeing and what kind of thoughts you have on just what\u2019s going on out there?","William Demchak","Yes. We actually don\u2019t expect a big change. We\u2019ve kind of said stable, but slower growth for a while, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve experienced and kind of what we see in the pipeline into the fourth quarter. I mean, I think, Rob can jump in here. If we look at the mix, we still got some growth on a large corporate on the back of M&A. We interestingly, for the first time in a while, saw some healthy growth in middle market which we hadn\u2019t seen for a while, continue to see real estate balance growth.","So it\u2019s \u2013 on the C&I side, it\u2019s kind of steady as it goes. And I\u2019m not exactly sure, what\u2019s happened with peers and with the H8 data. But as it relates to what we\u2019re able to do with existing and new clients, we seem to be on a steady path.","Scott Siefers","Okay. All right, that\u2019s perfect. Thank you very much.","William Demchak","Yes, sure.","Bryan Gill","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning.","William Demchak","Hi, Betsy.","Robert Reilly","Hi, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Hey, couple of questions. One is on excess liquidity. Just wanted to get your sense of how much dry powder do you think you have?","William Demchak","I mean, depending what you do with it, right? So all of it in theory could go into level one securities\u2026","Robert Reilly","All the Fed balances, yes.","William Demchak","All the Fed balances, yes. And then some subset of that, I don\u2019t remember the percentage, Rob, that can go into level two.","Robert Reilly","Yes, about $1 billion \u2013 of that $26 billion.","William Demchak","Yes. And one of \u2013 just as an aside, one of the things you saw, the securities build this quarter, you\u2019ve heard in Rob script that we asked to swap some of it. It\u2019s probably something we will continue to do simply, because where swap spreads it flat or negative levels, you\u2019re effectively taking treasuries at LIBOR plus and with LIBOR at an elevated level, you\u2019re earning more than you are at the balances of the Fed. So that drove a lot of what that security shift was this quarter, and you might see us continue to do that.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Okay. And then second question is just on the thrill of speech on how we\u2019re thinking about the stress test in 2018? Could you give us a sense as to how you read that for you specifically? How much excess capital do you think it gives you versus where you are today? And the \u2013 and how you think about the soft divi cap being gone?","William Demchak","I\u2019m sorry, the what?","Robert Reilly","The dividend cap?","William Demchak","Oh, okay.","Betsy Graseck","The dividend caps gone?","Robert Reilly","Hey, Betsy, this is Rob. So, we\u2019ve read what you\u2019ve read, which are sort of the proposed changes. In general, on the margin, we see them as maybe being beneficial to us, but of course, they\u2019re not final. At first blush, in terms of some of the calculations, in terms of the proposed stress capital buffer, it looks like it\u2019s a little bit more than what ours has been in the past. But we haven\u2019t begun our capital planning for next year per se. So we\u2019ll just have to address those issues when the rules become final so to speak.","On the dividend soft cap on that release that will be part of our consideration. We saw that \u2013 we see that as a good thing, and that will be part of our thinking.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And so the stress capital buffers a little bit higher than what you\u2019ve been experiencing, but still you\u2019ve got to execute [Multiple Speakers]?","Robert Reilly","Yes, it\u2019s the way that you want to do that there in terms of. So, 2.5% is more than what our stress test there.","Betsy Graseck","Yes.","Robert Reilly","Yes.","Betsy Graseck","Right, right, right, but you\u2019ve got excess capital on top of that anyway at this stage?","William Demchak","Yes.","Robert Reilly","Yes, that\u2019s right.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. All right. Hey, thanks a lot.","William Demchak","Sure.","Bryan Gill","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","Good morning.","William Demchak","Good morning.","Robert Reilly","Hi, John.","John Pancari","Just wanted to go back to expenses here. I know for the quarter, it looks like expenses on a couple of areas came in above your expectation not by a lot, but somewhat above it. And I know you\u2019re maintaining your year-over-year view on expenses. But they come in a bit higher for the quarter. So just wanted to get a better feel about what came in above your expectation from your point of view, and why you have the confidence that you can still meet that year-over-year goal, in other words, the fourth quarter trend? Thanks.","Robert Reilly","Yes. Well, I would say in terms of our expectations, I think are the expenses that increase quarter-over-quarter were in line with our guidance in terms of being stable, because it wasn\u2019t much. And the incremental amount around the FDIC surcharge, obviously, is a higher expense. So that\u2019s sort of a quarter-to-quarter comparison. Like\u2026","William Demchak","The HW had some compensation\u2026","Robert Reilly","Some business activity, yes, that\u2019s right. But I \u2013 you pointed out correctly, what we really focus on is the year-over-year. We\u2019re still \u2013 our guidance is still for stable. So in any given quarter, we can have timing of things, particularly around the investments in our business. So it\u2019s not uniform quarter-to-quarter.","John Pancari","Okay, all right. And then related to that and I\u2019m sorry if you alluded to this, I hopped on a call late. But the \u2013 any help in how we should think about 2017 when it comes to the CIP program, and what type of number we could be looking at? And also how much of that could we actually start to see fall into the bottom line? So now you\u2019re getting to a point with some of this back-office modernization effort and everything that you might be able to start to see and the rubber meets the roads here. So just want to try to get a better feel that as we at 2017?","Robert Reilly","Yes. We\u2019re not in a position to give 2017 guidance yet. We\u2019re in the middle of our budgeting process for that. So, we\u2019ll have more on all of that for you at the end of the year. I will say though the continuous improvement program has been a important tool for us, and that will continue, as you know, it\u2019s essentially generating savings that we used to fund our investments.","John Pancari","Okay, all right. And then lastly, if I may ask one more on the loan side, I think you alluded to it a little bit on the consumer side. But I just want to see the consumer loans inflected this quarter after a while of abetment given some run off. So just wanted to see what you\u2019re seeing there and do you think that sustainable?","William Demchak","Well that\u2019s one of our strategic focuses and we\u2019ve talked about that at a recent conference, where we think we have opportunity simply through better execution of our existing products faster fulfillment make it easier for customers, not really having to change your risk spots. Maybe some of that attitude flowed through to the volumes we saw this quarter. But we\u2019re in early stages and many of the changes we\u2019re going to make and most of that will take hold as we get into kind of 2017 and even out into 2018. I hope it\u2019s an inflection point, but I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d lock that down.","John Pancari","Got it. Okay, thanks, Bill.","William Demchak","Yes.","Bryan Gill","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gerry Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning, guys.","Bryan Gill","Hi, Gerry, good morning. It\u2019s Bryan.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you give us a little more color, you mentioned, Rob, about the noninterest income and the impact that the lower capital markets revenue had on it. And is there any color about what went on in the quarter? And then second what the pipeline, I know fourth quarter traditionally is a strong quarter for you guys in this area. Do you expect that to be the case?","William Demchak","Yes, I just think in terms of the quarter, I mean, obviously, the biggest increase in fee income came on the asset management side in part reflecting the higher equity markets. On the corporate services, we were down a little bit and most of that was related to the CMS, our valuation in the second quarter. So we\u2019re moving along consistent with our objectives, as you know, Gerard, in terms of the strategies that we\u2019ve laid out. So I would expect that to continue, but you might have some anomalies quarter-to-quarter.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay.","William Demchak","And then as far as the fourth quarter goes, I don\u2019t know if you heard on the first question just in terms of what we see relative to our guidance around stable probably up a bit in asset management and consumer services, offset by some corporate services and residential mortgage.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And then coming back to the new way we\u2019re going to calculate the CCAR capital within stressed capital buffer, because of the variability of that buffer versus the old conservation buffer, how you guys are approaching? And would that \u2013 would you guys want to keep a little more extra capital now because of the variability of this new stress capital buffer?","William Demchak","Yes, I\u2019m not sure I follow. So if you\u2019re talking about \u2013 potential variability of their 2.5% minimum?","Gerard Cassidy","Correct. In case, as you know now, it\u2019s going to be based upon how everybody makes it through the stress test and granted you\u2019re below the 2.5%. But because of that variability, whereas in the past, there wasn\u2019t the variability doing. Do you think that it would require you to keep a little extra to protect taking some\u2026","William Demchak","I don\u2019t \u2013 in many ways what they created and I\u2019ll admit up front that I\u2019m not expert on the proposal and it\u2019s not inked yet. But as I read through what it look like to me is what we actually have always done in the sense that you\u2019ve heard me talk about, we start kind of from the bottom up, as it relates to the amount of capital we want to hold.","So we run the stress against, but effectively being able to pass the severely adverse and then set a buffer on that, say, that\u2019s the capital we\u2019re going to hold now. As you know, we\u2019ve been running a little bit above that. These new changes, the combination of the ability to truncate your capital actions the fact that they\u2019re not going to grow your balance sheet in the back, and so your RWA is down. And the fact that our, at least, most recent loss has been below their 2.5 % kind of give us a lot room here.","Gerard Cassidy","Yes.","William Demchak","But we\u2019ve got to get all those sort of modeled up to see the puts and takes and actually see the final rule. But all else equal, as Rob said at the start, we think that\u2019s probably pretty good thing for us.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then just finally, can you give us an update on the branch network? I think you guys pointed out that about 18% of the network operates under the universal model. What do you see that being at the end of next year, as a percentage of your total branches?","Robert Reilly","Well, you\u2019re right. So at the completion of 2016, we\u2019ll have about 550 universal branches out of the roughly 2,600, so that percentage is right. We like what we see in terms of the results there and we\u2019re going to continue to improve that mix. But again, we don\u2019t have the specific 2017 guidance in terms of a fixed number.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Thank you.","Bryan Gill","Next question please.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please go ahead.","Brian Klock","Yes. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question, guys. I wanted to ask a little bit, your credit quality is still one of the strongest in the group. Just within the quarter, you\u2019ve seen the improvements in the energy-related portfolio. It look like the 32 basis points of commercial loan charge-offs came from non-oil and gas or non-coal.","So is there anything in there that that beginning to be just normalization in that book, or were there anything special on that the commercial charge-offs for the quarter?","Robert Reilly","Well, it\u2019s \u2013 yes, it\u2019s a little bit of a mix. The majority of that is in our asset-based group, which is secured lending. And many of those instances, although, they weren\u2019t per se energy companies, they served energy companies. So by extension, it was energy related.","Brian Klock","Got it. Okay. Then just thinking about for the fourth quarter, the guidance you gave for the provision, obviously, lower than what you\u2019re guiding for in the third quarter. I guess thinking about the fall borrowing base, redeterminations coming up, and you\u2019ve got oil prices being a little bit more stable, so is there an expectation that maybe there could be some reserve releasing out of that 6% oil and gas reserve?","Robert Reilly","No, I don\u2019t think so. I think, we believe that as I said in my opening remarks, we\u2019re appropriately reserved and we take all that into consideration.","Brian Klock","Okay. Thanks for your time.","William Demchak","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Harbes with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jason Harbes","Hey, good morning, guys.","William Demchak","Hi, Jason.","Robert Reilly","Hey, Jason.","Jason Harbes","Could you offer a little bit more perspective on some of the consumer loan growth trends? I know there has been a fair amount of runoff in the HELOC and the student lending books. But at a recent conference you laid out some pretty ambitious growth targets for card and some other consumer areas. So, I guess, the question is, can you maybe elaborate a little bit of \u2013 on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of consumer borrowing and maybe how quickly you could start to see the benefits of some of the different initiatives that you laid out?","William Demchak","Sure. Specifically, what we talked about is a longer-term project basically streamline the fulfillment of many of our consumer lending products, make it easier for our customers, make it more digital. And we kind of opened ourselves up to our own criticism on the speed at which we do things today and the business we lose because of it.","On a prior question somebody said have we seen a turn in a corner and will we grow consumer from here? And I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s the case. But we have seen and continue to see growth in credit card in an auto. And importantly, inside of auto, we\u2019ve seen continued accelerated growth in direct auto through our Check Ready product, which I guess and I think it\u2019s in the first quarter of next year, we\u2019ll actually have on mobile.","So, I think this will accelerate through time, but it\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to make a dramatic difference in the first-half of 2017. It\u2019s just there and something we can execute on over the next couple of years that we think long-term we\u2019ll have a pretty material difference in our ability to change the growth trajectory of consumer lending.","Robert Reilly","And our overall mix of total loans.","William Demchak","Yes, yes.","Jason Harbes","Okay. Thanks for the color. And maybe if I could follow up with a question on operating leverage. It looks like you\u2019re on pace to achieve some this year despite very minimal benefit from interest rates. It may be premature to start speculating about 2017, given that you\u2019re going through the budgeting process now. But assuming we do get that additional rate hike in December, would it be realistic to expect a continuation of that more positive trend next year?","Robert Reilly","Well, again, we\u2019re not going to get into 2017 guidance. As I mentioned, we\u2019re in the middle of our budgeting process. We have said before and we say again that, our objective is positive operating leverage over a multi-year time period and thought about in terms of our strategic plan, we see a path of positive operating leverage outside of rates.","William Demchak","Independent of rates and that was kind of the theme of that we went through in a conference that\u2019s how can we do it without the help of rates. And that comes on the back of some of these initiatives inside of consumer lending and the continued growth we\u2019ve seen in fees, which we think we can keep doing.","Robert Reilly","And to your point in terms of our year-to-date progress, we\u2019re not that far off.","Jason Harbes","Thanks, guys.","William Demchak","Yes.","Bryan Gill","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jesus Bueno with Compass Point. Please go ahead.","Jesus Bueno","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. We saw your real estate \u2013 commercial real estate balances move up again in 3Q. And as it relates to warnings that we\u2019ve heard from regulators recently on CRE, have you seen any impacts in the markets in which you operate recently?","William Demchak","Not really. Our real estate business has been fairly consistent for a number of years, where we kind of work with Class A developers and markets and products and that continues. Now, we have seen a slowdown in the origination of new projects and a pickup of balance related \u2013 balances related to permanent lending.","So think of the product that historically might have gone into CMBS is now being structured more like what we would call life insurance product, much lower leverage, better loan to value, and you\u2019ll see that in our permanent lending line.","So we\u2019re not seeing stress. In fact, our portfolio actually on a credit metric basis continues to improve. We would tell you that we monitor it pretty closely. We\u2019re clearly seeing some signs of weakness in multifamily. In a couple of markets, we see some signs of weakness down in Houston on the back of oil and gas. But against our book, we feel pretty good about it.","Jesus Bueno","That\u2019s great. Thank you. And if I could ask another question, just on your provision guidance, assuming kind of current trends hold and we see oil kind of stay around this $50 level. I guess, would you anticipate, I guess, coming in at the lower-end of your provision if that were to hold?","Robert Reilly","There was an earlier question in terms of the effect of some of the changes. We think we\u2019re appropriately reserved in terms of our provision guidance, it\u2019s all \u2013 all of what we expect to happen in oil and gas is part of that.","William Demchak","Yes. I mean part of the thing you have to remember is provisions have been so low relative to historical standards that to try to pinpoint inside of that range, we just can\u2019t do it, because it\u2019s one credit that\u2019s going to move it.","Robert Reilly","Yes.","William Demchak","One way or the other.","Robert Reilly","And we\u2019ve seen that for sometime now.","William Demchak","Yes.","Jesus Bueno","Understood. Thanks for taking my questions.","William Demchak","Yes.","Bryan Gill","Yes. Next question please.","Operator","And, sir, we have no further questions.","Bryan Gill","Okay. Thank you.","William Demchak","Very good.

These are all available on our corporate website, pnc.com, under Investor Relations. These statements speak only as of April 13, 2018, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Demchak.","William Demchak","Thanks, Bryan, and good morning everybody. As you've seen by now for the first quarter we reported net income of $1.2 billion or $2.43 per diluted common share. Compared to the same period a year ago, we delivered higher net interest income and fee income, and we also benefited from a lower federal tax rate.","On the whole, it was a pretty good quarter. And I would like to thank our employees for their continued hard work. On a sequential basis, we were impacted by seasonality, as we expected. But in addition, there were a couple of headwinds that are worth mentioning.","First, our average loan growth was modestly weaker than we expected, although spot loans grew by $1.2 billion. Within C&IB's real estate business, multifamily agency warehouse lending declined in the first quarter as these balances tend to fluctuate pretty broadly.","Aside from that, pricing and structure in the commercial real estate space have become more aggressive resulting in lower new volumes. And at the same time, payouts and maturities continue at a steady rate which of course, makes balanced growth more challenging.","Outside of CRE, the underlying trends in our loan portfolios are largely positive, and Rob\u2019s going to take you through those in more detail in a moment. Secondly, the movement in rates impacted us this quarter.","Clearly, we benefited from higher loan yields as a result of the increase in Fed funds and one-month LIBOR. But on the other hand, our funding cost rose this quarter due to higher deposit pricing and as betas continued to move higher.","And additionally, the sharp rise in three-month LIBOR relative to one-month LIBOR caused our cost of borrowed funds to increase more than we expected. That said, we continue to execute well against our strategic priorities and we're excited about our plans to tap new opportunities as the year unfolds.","You\u2019re all aware of the steps we've taken over the last two years to expand our middle-market franchise to Dallas, Kansas City and Minneapolis in 2017, and Denver, Houston and Nashville this year. Now that work is going very well as our new regional presidents and our teams there have hit those \u2013 in those markets have hit the ground running.","In addition, we've built an industry-leading technology platform and we're beginning to leverage these capabilities to innovate and enhance the ease in which our customers do business with us. And we are looking forward to beginning the rollout of our new national retail digital strategy later in the year, which will help us take advantage of our brand awareness and to begin serving more customers and more consumer customers beyond our traditional Retail Banking footprint.","In fact, we're in the middle of our strategic planning season, and I can't actually recall a time when we've had as many attractive organic investment opportunities as we do right now.","With that, I'm going to turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our first quarter results, and then we'll take your questions. Rob?","Robert Reilly","Yes. Thanks, Bill, and good morning everyone. As Bill just mentioned, our first quarter net income was $1.2 billion or $2.43 per diluted common share. Net interest margin expanded. Capital return remained strong. Expenses were well managed. And of course, our results benefited from a lower tax rate.","Our balance sheet is on Slide four and is presented on an average basis. Total loans were essentially flat linked-quarter. However, our spot loans grew by $1.2 billion since year-end. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, both spot and average loans grew by $8.8 billion or 4%, and I'll discuss the drivers of this growth in a few moments.","Investment securities of $74.6 billion increased approximately $400 million or 1% linked-quarter, as purchases exceeded portfolio runoff. Purchases were primarily made up of U.S. treasuries and agency RMBS.","In addition, $600 million of money market mutual fund securities were reclassified to equity investments due to an accounting standard adoption. Excluding this reclassification, investment securities increased about $1 billion compared to the fourth quarter.","Our balances at the Federal Reserve were $25.4 billion for the first quarter, essentially flat linked-quarter and up $1.7 billion year-over-year. On the liability side, total deposits declined by approximately $800 million compared to the fourth quarter reflecting seasonal activity primarily on the commercial side. Year-over-year, deposits increased by $5.7 billion or 2%.","Average common shareholders equity increased by approximately $300 million linked-quarter. During the quarter, we returned $1.1 billion of capital to shareholders or 96% of first quarter net income through repurchases of 4.8 million common shares for $747 million and dividends of $362 million.","As of March 31, 2018, our Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated to be 9.6%, down 20 basis points compared to December 31, 2017. This is primarily due to a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of the impact of higher interest rates on available for sale securities.","Our return on average assets for the first quarter was 1.34%. Our return on average common equity was 11.04%. And our tangible book value was $71.58 per common share as of March 31, which declined slightly on a linked-quarter basis, reflecting the impact of AOCI, but was up 6% compared to the same date a year ago.","Turning to Slide five, as I just mentioned, total average loans of $221 billion were essentially flat linked-quarter. However, the flattening effect, if you will, was largely due to a $1.5 billion decline in average agency warehouse lending balances which, Bill mentioned, tend to fluctuate. Importantly, spot loans increased by $1.2 billion or 1% linked-quarter and both spot and average loans increased $8.8 billion, or 4% year-over-year.","As I've mentioned, the commercial loan decline in the quarter was a result of the fourth quarter warehouse lending activity as well as slightly lower commercial real estate balances. Offsetting this decline was broad-based growth in virtually all our other commercial lending segments, including corporate banking, which was up 1% linked-quarter and 7% year-over-year, business credit, which was up 1% linked-quarter and 13% year-over-year and equipments finance which was up 2% linked-quarter and 14% year-over-year. Commercial loans grew by $8.4 billion or 6% compared to the same period a year ago.","Consumer lending increased by $242 million linked-quarter and $402 million year-over-year, driven by increases in residential mortgage, auto and credit card loans, which were partially offset by declines in home equity and education lending.","Turning to slide six, as expected, total deposits were down compared to the fourth quarter, primarily due to seasonal commercial outflows, somewhat offset by higher consumer deposits, compared to the same period a year ago, deposits increased by $5.7 billion, or 2%, reflecting growth in both consumer and commercial deposits.","Total interest-bearing deposits increased $6.6 billion or 4% year-over-year, while non-interest bearing deposits declined approximately $850 million during the same period which reflected a shift in our deposit mix as a result of the rising rate environment.","In addition, deposit betas continue to move upward in the first quarter. Our cumulative beta, which is the beta on our total interest-bearing deposits since December 2015, was 21% and our current beta since December 2017 was 32%, compared to our stated long-term expectation of 46%. In simple terms, our accumulative commercial beta is already approaching stated levels and while our consumer betas have lagged, we do expect them to accelerate in the second quarter and throughout the balance of the year.","As I've already mentioned, and you can see on slide seven, net income in the first quarter was $1.2 billion. Net interest income increased $16 million or 1% linked-quarter. These higher loan yields were partially offset by higher funding costs and the impact of two fewer days in the quarter.","Compared to the fourth quarter, non-interest income declined $165 million or 9%, reflecting seasonally lower fee income and the impact of significant items on our fourth quarter results. Non-interest expense decreased by $534 million or 17% compared to the fourth quarter, also reflecting the impact of significant items last quarter. Expenses continue to be well managed due in part to our Continuous Improvement Program.","Provision for credit losses in the first quarter was $92 million, a decrease of $33 million linked-quarter as overall credit quality remained stable. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 17%, reflecting the impact of federal tax legislation. For the full year 2018, we continue to expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 17%.","Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to slide eight, net interest income increased by $16 million or 1% linked-quarter as higher loan deals were partially offset by higher deposit and borrowing costs as well as two fewer days in the quarter. The day count impact was approximately $42 million.","As you'll recall, fourth quarter net interest income was negatively affected by $26 million due to the impact of tax legislation related to leverage leases. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, net interest income increased by $201 million or 9%, driven by higher loan and securities yields and higher loan balances.","Net interest margin was 2.91%, an increase of three basis points compared to the fourth quarter as higher loan yields were partially offset by higher funding costs as a result of the sharp increase in three month LIBOR as well as the widening spread between one-month LIBOR and three-month LIBOR during the first quarter. While a large portion of our loans are tied to one-month LIBOR, essentially all of our borrowed funds are tied to three-month LIBOR.","First quarter non-interest income was down $165 million or 9% linked-quarter reflecting seasonally lower trends as well as the impact of significant items in the fourth quarter. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, non-interest income increased $26 million or 2%. This reflected 6% growth in fee income, which is partially offset by a lower other non-interest income.","Slide nine provides more detail on our non-interest income, looking at the various categories, asset management fees, which includes earnings from our equity investments and BlackRock were down $265 million on a linked-quarter basis, largely due to the flow-through impact of tax legislation benefits on BlackRock's earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017.","Compared to the same quarter last year, asset management fees increased by $52 million or 13%, reflecting higher equity markets and a 5% increase in PNC's assets under management. Additionally, our earnings from BlackRock benefited from a lower tax rate.","Consumer services fees were down $9 million or 2% compared to fourth quarter results reflecting seasonally lower client activity. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, consumer services fees increased $25 million or 8%, and included growth in credit card, brokerage and debit card fees.","Corporate service fees decreased by $29 million or 6% compared to strong fourth quarter results, driven by seasonally lower M&A advisory fees and loan syndication fees. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, corporate services fees increased $15 million or 4%, reflecting higher treasury management fees and operating lease income.","As we previously disclosed in our 10-K, operating lease income is now reported in corporate services fees rather than other income and prior periods have been reclassified. Residential mortgage non-interest income increased $68 million linked-quarter reflecting a negative $71 million adjustment related to updated MSR fair value assumptions in the fourth quarter.","Residential mortgage income declined on a year-over-year basis primarily driven by lower loan sales revenue which reflected lower refinancing volumes. Service charges on deposits decreased by $16 million or 9% compared to the fourth quarter, driven by seasonally lower customer activity. On a year-over-year basis, however, service charges on deposits increased $6 million or 4% reflecting client growth.","Finally, other non-interest income increased $86 million compared to the fourth quarter, which included a negative $129 million net impact of significant items. Excluding these items, other non-interest income declined $43 million linked-quarter, primarily due to lower net gains on commercial mortgage loans held for sale.","Compared to the same period a year ago, other non-interest income declined $56 million, reflecting lower revenue from equity investments, including the impact of a first quarter 2017 benefit from valuation adjustments related to the Volcker Rule.","Going forward and considering the reclassification of operating lease income into corporate services fees, we now expect the quarterly run rate for other non-interest income to be in the range of $225 million to $275 million, excluding net securities and visa activity.","Turning to slide 10, first quarter expenses decreased by $534 million or 17% reflecting the impact of approximately $500 million of significant items in the fourth quarter. These consisted of a contribution to the PNC Foundation, real estate disposition and extra charges and employee cash payments and pension account credit.","Excluding the impact of these items, first quarter expenses declined $32 million or 1%, reflecting seasonally lower expenses and our continued focus on cost management. We've previously announced the goal to reduce cost by $250 million in 2018 as part of our Continuous Improvement Program, and based on first quarter results we are on track and confident we will achieve our full-year target.","Turning to slide 11, overall credit quality remained stable in the first quarter compared to the prior quarter. Total nonperforming loans were down $23 million and continue to represent less than 1% of our total loans.","Total delinquencies were down $131 million or 9% linked-quarter from elevated levels at year-end that reflected seasonality and the residual impact of the 2017 hurricanes. Provision for credit losses of $92 million decreased by $33 million linked-quarter reflecting lower provision for consumer loans, partially offset by a higher provision for commercial loans.","The decline in consumer provision was driven by favorable historical performance on home equity loans, while the higher commercial provision reflects the impact of fourth quarter reserve releases. These results take into account the outcome of the recently completed shared national credit examination.","Net charge-offs decreased $10 million to $113 million in the first quarter, primarily due to lower commercial net charge-offs. In the first quarter, the annualized net charge-off ratio was 21 basis points, down one basis point linked-quarter.","In summary, PNC posted strong first quarter results. For the remainder of the year, we expect continued steady growth in GDP and a corresponding increase in short-term interest rates two more times this year, in June and December, with each increase being 25 basis points.","Based on these assumptions, our full year 2018 guidance compared to 2017 adjusted full-year results remains unchanged and positions us to deliver positive operating leverage in 2018. Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2018 reported results, we expect modest loan growth. We expect total net interest income to be up low single digits. We expect fee income to be up mid-single digits.","We expect other non-interest income to be in the $225 million to $275 million range. We expect expenses to be up low single digits. And we expect provision to be between $100 million and $150 million.","And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore ISI Research. You may proceed with your question.","John Pancari","Good morning.","William Demchak","Hi, John.","John Pancari","Just wanted to see if you could talk a little bit more about the increase in the cost on the borrowed funds, I know you indicated that the increase was more than you had expected. Can you just talk about how that exceeded your expectations, and also, I mean, just since its majority is tied to three-month LIBOR, I assume you would've had pretty good visibility into that, so, if you could talk about how that exceeded? And then what are your plans there? Is there a plan to remix it? Or are you focusing more on the deposit side to help offset that? How do you address that going forward? Thanks.","William Demchak","It\u2019s a good question. Basically what happened is that the spread between one-month and three-month LIBOR gapped out particularly in March wider than it's historically run. I guess it's a 35, 34 basis points today, and historically, it might have been half of that. So all else equal in our forecast of NII, we wouldn't assume that you'd see that gap. The issue is -- today, it is as wide as any time it's been in history other than the financial crisis. And a lot of people are writing that, that basis will collapse back in.","We'll have to wait and see. I think there some pressures causing that as a function of the revamp of the money market industry coupled with some implications from this big tax provision that is in the new federal tax code. So we are going to have to wait and see. If it doesn't change, we can -- and we'll probably do this anyway, we can start swapping our wholesale funding to our banknotes into one-month just to get the basis mismatch between our loans and funding closer. But that price will be embedded in that swap, so we'll have to see -- wait and see, what happens.","John Pancari","Okay, all right. Thanks.","Robert Reilly","Hey, John, I can jump in there. So, some of the increase in three-month LIBOR is fundamental to rates rising. The issue is just the gap. And that gap, as Bill mentioned, was about 35 basis points and we equate that to about $15 million or $20 million cost in the quarter.","John Pancari","Got it. Okay. All right. And then, my follow-up is around loan growth. I know you did not change your full year outlook around loan growth. The average balances were somewhat flattish this quarter. You did see good growth in the end of period. So first of all, I'm assuming the end of period trends are likely more indicative of your expectations given you're not changing your full year outlook.","And then separately, can you talk about the broader macro backdrop? I mean, we've seen weak industry loan growth, that's for sure for the sector, but the macro signs still point to improvement, particularly given tax reform. So if you could just talk about that a little bit?","William Demchak","Yes. I think our own performance kind of mirrors what you see in the NHA data where you saw a decent pickup in March and we're seeing that in our pipeline, so I don't know what the anomaly was in Jan, Feb other than all the busywork everybody did prior to that tax getting enacted.","So all else equal, I would kind of say that March is the norm and Jan, Feb were the anomalies and that should set us up well for the rest of the year. The one exception to that, and I mentioned this, was in real estate, where we've just seen pricing structure get to a place where it's kind of beyond our risk tolerance and versus our historical growth in that sector were most certain to be slower.","John Pancari","Okay, great. Thanks Bill.","Operator","Our next question comes from John McDonald with Bernstein. You may proceed with your question.","John McDonald","Hi, good morning. In terms of the retail deposit betas changing, we're trying to get a sense of the pacing. The disclosures you guys gave on page six were really helpful. So if you look at the 17% current deposit beta this quarter, it's up from the cumulative 8% since rates started rising. Rob, any kind of broad sense of where that might have stood last quarter and is this something where we could get to the stated beta in a couple of quarters? Or this could take a while to get there? Any thoughts there?","Robert Reilly","Yes. So, good question in terms of the betas particularly on the consumer side where they've lagged. We're keeping an eye on that. Relative to last quarter, they have accelerated, so that's true. And then going into the second quarter, we do expect it to accelerate on top of that. How much remains to be seen, because a lot of that's competitive pressures, but our best estimates are built into our NII guidance.","John McDonald","And when \u2013 what factor \u2013 can you just remind us what factors you're looking at when you make these decisions, you're looking at competition locally, and I guess, nationally? And then what your loan growth plans are? And everything gets put in the mix there?","William Demchak","All of the above.","Robert Reilly","Absolutely.","John McDonald","Just the last thing, any color on \u2013 more color on the deposit mix shift you're seeing? Just more consumer versus commercial within the deposit mix, you're seeing folks move from checking to time and savings but within PNC?","William Demchak","Yes. Now the shift this quarter on commercial is more of a seasonal effect of commercial deposits. It's sort of running down. We would actually expect them to come back. As you know, they don't help us particularly with LCR, so it's not quite as important as to what \u2013 versus what we do in the consumer side.","John McDonald","And in terms of the behavior that you're seeing on the consumer side, any more color there?","William Demchak","Pretty consistent, John, with what we've been seeing in terms of more of the savings and the relationship-driven deposits which we've been pursuing for the better part of the last year, so that trend continues.","John McDonald","I guess I was just asking. Is that accelerated kind of like the deposit pricing? Is that also gotten faster this quarter?","William Demchak","Yeah, a little bit. Yeah, a little bit.","John McDonald","Okay. Thanks.","William Demchak","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erika Najarian from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed with your question.","Erika Najarian","Yes. Thank you. Good morning.","William Demchak","Good morning, Erika.","Erika Najarian","Yes. My first question is on the Fed proposal for CET1, specifically, for the stress capital buffer. I think the market was reading it as largely positive for banks like PNC and that the \u2013 you now have a pretty set floor in terms of where your capital minimums would be. And I'm wondering if the stress capital buffer did get finalized as it stands, how that would change how you're thinking about buybacks and dividends from here? And also, how you're accounting for the volatility now in your business as usual CET1 levels given, of course, your CCAR results now feed into it?","Robert Reilly","Okay. This is Rob. Why don't I take a shot at some of that?","William Demchak","I'm not sure I understood the last part of the question.","Robert Reilly","Well, I'll just sort of \u2013 I mean, it broaden that out a little bit in terms of the Fed's proposal in terms of the changes to CCAR, which in broad measure are encouraging. We just got it Tuesday, as you know, so we're still reviewing it. But a couple of things right off the top that are helpful, obviously, are the elimination of the soft capital on dividends at the 30%.","The reduction of base case capital action from the severe scenario with the exception of a year's worth of dividends, the RWA growth in the severe scenario, and then also that the elimination of the quantitative sale. So all those things, I think, worked well and are encouraging. The stress capital buffer itself, we have to review. If you take a look at our 2016 and 2017 CCAR submissions, we were below that. It remains to be seen how the Fed stresses us in this go around, we'll see.","But there is an issue there around, what we call, guardrails around the scenarios, because the severe scenarios, in any given year, are going to define that stress capital buffer, which, in the past has been below 2.5%, but theoretically could be higher.","Erika Najarian","To clarify that last question, sorry to be confusing. But given that volatility in results, the question there had been, does it \u2013 how should you or how should your investors think about potential buffers that you would incorporate to account for that volatility of result?","William Demchak","Yeah. That's kind of the million dollar question. So internally, this \u2013 you've heard us talk about this before. We always work towards the endpoint on a severe stress as opposed to the starting point of what our capital is. And we've talked historically about a target capital state in CET1 of 8.25% to 8.5%. That number being driven historically by our own estimate of what a severe stress would look like.","An issue for us is as we approach that number, if the Fed goes from a relatively benign severe stress perhaps as they did last year versus a much more severe stress perhaps as they did this year, you have to change your buffer on-the-fly, which causes you to then have volatility, as you point out, in your repurchases year-on-year. And I don't know how that plays out through time as a function of what scenarios they come up with. But it's one of the things that we need to solve for us as we work through the next year.","Erika Najarian","And just one more follow-up question, you mentioned that your organic investment opportunity have never been so attractive. And I'm thinking, could you share with us what in your earned-back period is for buyback activity at current valuation levels?","William Demchak","Sorry, our earn-back. I mean, I would tell you that we look at it sort of multiple ways. But on an IRR basis, we're today, probably fairly tight. We look at that. We look at where we are price-to-book. We look at what we think our forward earnings potential is which potentially offset those other two issues. I don't know that I've actually talked about an earn-back period internally.","Robert Reilly","But to your point, the investment opportunities that we take a look at clearly beat that.","William Demchak","Yes.","Erika Najarian","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question.","Ken Usdin","Hey, guys. How are you doing? Thanks very much. I want to just ask a question on expenses, and I know there's couple of things, you bought that little IRR firm and a couple of other moving parts. And noticing that the personnel costs are up 8% year-over-year, and can you just help us understand just is that recent hires? Is it \u2013 are you starting to spend some of the tax benefits?","Robert Reilly","Yes.","Ken Usdin","Just how will we understand kind of the balance of growth versus the CIP, especially as it relates to personnel cost? Thanks.","Robert Reilly","Yeah. Sure, Ken. So just in terms of expenses in the first quarter, linked-quarter expenses were down low single-digits which was part of our guidance. The year-over-year, there's a couple of things going on there. First, and most prominently, first quarter 2018 expenses reflect the expenses associated with the acquisitions that you pointed out that happened subsequent to the first quarter.","Most notably, the leasing company, which we acquired in the second quarter of 2017, and those expenses which are about $27 million are spread out between personnel and equipment expense, personnel because of the higher headcount, and equipment expenses because of the depreciation nature of the leasing business. So that's one.","In addition, on the personnel side, we do have some increases around investments that we've made, the hourly wage increase for our retail employees that we announced at the end of the year is there, as well as some of the investments we've made in the new markets as you would expect. So personnel is a little bit higher, but year-over-year, occupancy is down, marketing is flat and all other expenses, which are a lot of categories and were a lot of our CIP program is directed, is in line. So we feel good about what we set out to do and that's why like I said, on the Continuous Improvement Program, we have high confidence that we will achieve it.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Got it. And then just one quick follow-up on the \u2013 I understand that you move the operating lease up into the commercial, corporate services. So can you now with that in there, can you just help us understand from a corporate services perspective within your fee outlook for the second quarter, remind us of the seasonality and what drivers you would expect to flow from that?","Robert Reilly","Yeah, sure. I can broaden that out for you in terms of our guidance for all the fee categories, not just corporate services, but it's fairly easy in terms of guidance, up mid-single digits in the whole. And for the first time in a while, for each of the five categories, asset management, consumer, corporate services, mortgages and service charges on deposits, all up mid-single digits, so, mid-single digits overall, mid-single digits in each of the categories, including corporate services.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Got it. Thanks for that, Rob.","Robert Reilly","Yeah. Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question.","William Demchak","Betsy, are you there?","Betsy Graseck","Hey. Yeah. Hey, good morning. Talking on mute. Sorry about that.","William Demchak","No problem.","Betsy Graseck","Question, just a follow-up on the expense discussion we just had. I wanted to understand if in 1Q, any of the continuous improvement is in the quarter? Or is this something that you expect just going to be ramping over 2018?","Robert Reilly","It's both. This is some, as I mentioned, there's some in the first quarter largely directed at the all other expense line. But there's more to go.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And so, you've got a run rate that you expect would be building throughout 2018. And would it be primarily focused on the real estate as opposed to people? I'm just trying to make sure I understand where improvements are coming from?","Robert Reilly","Yes, in terms of the Continues Improvement Program?","Betsy Graseck","Correct.","Robert Reilly","I would say, now as I would say, again, just to back up, our objective is positive operating leverage. Our guidance is for expenses to be up low single digits for the year. Part of that is the implementation of the Continuous Improvement Program savings that really are all over the bank. Each area has a targeted level that we review regularly to be able to achieve those. So even in areas where we are investing, retail, for example, there's substantial continuous improvement savings there as well, so it's broad-based.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then separately, just \u2013 I wanted to drill a little bit about on C&I, I know you went through the various categories in where you're seeing the loan growth. It does feel like it's decelerating a little bit. I mean, year-on-year, it's clearly stronger than what the LQA would be. But the question is, are you able to deliver the level of growth you've been generating which looks like it's not only solid good, but maybe a little above peers due to the new markets you're going into? Or is there any sign of increased interest in current borrowers actually increasing their leverage and borrowing more? Do you see more of the share gain? Or clients are increasing their activity levels that you already have?","William Demchak","Well, what we've seen, you saw in March, I think C&I hit record levels actually. So there is increasing stock in effect of C&I loans out there. But inside of that, we continue, both through differentiated product and then through an effect to new markets and kind of harvesting some of the new markets that we've been in, we've been able to sort of outpace peers. And we would expect that to continue with the one exception, I mentioned, of real estate. I don't know what peers are going to do. But that market is increasingly tight. We wouldn't expect to see the growth rates we have in the past.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And\u2026","Robert Reilly","But we are still got into mid-single-digit loan growth for the year. So that's all part of it.","Betsy Graseck","So a little bit of a pickup though from what you've had this quarter, in terms of run rate there?","William Demchak","Yes. It's interesting. When you think through all the noise this quarter, they actually had a pretty decent quarter in C&I. We had a big drawdown in mortgage warehousing as I said and still managed to grow spot.","Robert Reilly","Yes, and even, like I said on the segments, and I mentioned in my comments, corporate banking, up 1%; business credit, up 1%; equipment, finance up 2%.","William Demchak","Yes.","Robert Reilly","Pretty strong.","Betsy Graseck","Yes, Q-on-Q. Okay. Thank you.","Robert Reilly","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. You may proceed with your question.","Kevin Barker","Thank you. In regards to the loan growth, just a follow-up there. Does the retail digital strategy and the rollout of that have a big impact on your expected loan growth in the back half of this year?","William Demchak","No. No. It's -- the retail strategy will progress but it will start as a deposit gathering exercise. What we think will be attractive returns for us because we don't have the brick-and-mortar costs and we'll have an ability to pay somewhat above what we pay in existing markets. We will augment that offering with loan offerings in all of our products through time. But you should expect that it will start out as deposit and sort of migrate over time.","Robert Reilly","So no in 2018, really.","William Demchak","Yes.","Kevin Barker","Okay. And then given we've had tax reform, lower taxes for a few months now, have you seen any behavioral changes as far as competition amongst your peers in order -- given that they're seeing better ROEs due to lower taxes?","William Demchak","Yes, anecdotally. So deal on deal and certain behaviors would suggest that people are willing to cut price as a function of the after-tax ROE. And the competition for sort of plain vanilla C&I loans was tough in the first quarter in terms of price. So I think that is starting to show its end, much less so in any of that special\u2026","Robert Reilly","Like in special -- and also not long enough to be able to access that like Bill said it's really anecdotal and the deals that we saw in the first 90 days in the first quarter.","William Demchak","Yes.","Kevin Barker","So is it primarily on C&I lending? Or any particular industries that you're seeing that competition pick up or is it broadly on several different loan categories?","William Demchak","It's interesting. It's on the most generic one bank and hold the whole deal C&I loans, which is kind of the craziest place, in my view, to start competing away price because you still have the risk associated with the loan and your actual -- we had this discussion a quarter ago, your lost distribution on an after-tax basis causes you to actually have hold more capital again such thing.","Kevin Barker","Right.","William Demchak","So it kind of surprises me. I would expect to see more competition on deposit pricing and on fee-based services in terms of giving some of the excess margin back. And I don't think we've seen that at all.","Kevin Barker","How much of it do you think is due to pretty low loan growth? And just the amount of capital versus taxes?","William Demchak","Some amount of that and I think it's also we have whatever the number is 5500 depository institutions in this country, many of which don't have much to offer beyond loans, so that's a product they compete with. And as you go downsize in loans, or something that can hold entire loan, you run into that group. It's less \u2013 it's not happening on the big syndicated loans. It's not happening on asset base or anything that takes where there's only really a handful of credible players.","Kevin Barker","Thank you for taking my question.","William Demchak","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your may proceed with your question.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning, guys.","Robert Reilly","Hey, Gerard.","William Demchak","Hi, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","I apologize if I had to jump out for a minute if you answered this question already. But Bill you started your presentation off with the comment about that you've not seen as many good organic investment opportunities as you're seeing today. You've already talked about the national consumer. What are some of the other organic investment opportunities that you guys are looking at that gives you that kind of positive tone to it?","William Demchak","Yes. So the success we've had in newer markets, obviously, brings up the desire to do more. The list we have on digital things that we want to rollout in consumer, but also importantly in C&I and the TM space is quite large. So there's a lot of asks on the table, the things that make a lot of business sense that I think differentiate us longer term. Some of it is product-based, some of it is market expansion-based, some of it is investment, in effect, consumer service, the speed of which we can do fulfillments and the ease of which we can serve consumers, which would offer a differentiated product to our customers, so there's a lot.","And you've heard me talk about this before. We didn't feel like we starved our firm for investment through the lower rate environment. We invested pretty, pretty heavily, which was a good thing. And we\u2019re at a place now where that ask has sort of accelerated as I guess is what I'm seeing in the strategic planning session this season.","Robert Reilly","Yeah, and I would \u2013 Gerald, I just would extend on that in the sense that much of it is possible because of the technology investments we've made over the last couple of years. So things that were interesting before we just didn't have the technology to be able to facilitate, we do now.","William Demchak","Yes. And part of that is we're now spending an ever increasing percentage of our tech budget on consumer facing applications as opposed to building and running\u2026","Robert Reilly","Infrastructure.","William Demchak","Yes.","Gerard Cassidy","In fact, following up on that, how critical is having that capability? Obviously, your big competitors have it, but maybe some of the smaller banks you run into in different markets don't have as good of a product that you guys have. So when you guys look at that, if you have had it on a scale of one to 10, 10 being most critical, one not being critical at all, how important it is \u2013 is it for you guys to have that ability to generate this kind of business through this digital channel?","William Demchak","I think in the future state of the world, I think it's a 10 I mean, 12\u2026","Gerard Cassidy","Yes, no, good.","William Demchak","Things have to be simple. They have to be fast. They have to be coordinated. Customer information needs to be consolidated. It needs to be in one place. All of that stuff, you can't really execute unless you have a core backbone kind of that allows you to do it.","Robert Reilly","And the client's expectations continue to accelerate.","Gerard Cassidy","Absolutely. And then just finally, as you guys you know, there's been changes coming out of Washington on regulations regarding capital and the CCAR stress test, et cetera. There seems to be news coming out that the dividend payout ratio is not going to be limited anymore. You won't get enhanced regulatory review if you go over 30%. What does the board think? And you guys think in terms about if we look out a couple of years, do you see a dividend payout ratio coming in north of 40% or 40%?","William Demchak","Yes.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay, good. Thank you.","Robert Reilly","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes. Hi, good morning. This is Rob from Matt's team. Just on commercial loan yields. They're up nicely this quarter. Just curious, how do current kind of new money yields compare just given the March rate hike, but also your commentary about kind of higher competition on commercial lending right now?","William Demchak","Do you have the new spreads up for me? The actual spread on loans didn't move a lot, but I think...","Robert Reilly","It's four [Indiscernible] on the yields, you mean,. So spreads, yes, spreads have held up.","Unidentified Analyst","New deal spreads aren't -- they're kind of spot on where they were so we haven't seen a lot of the change.","Robert Reilly","That's right.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then similar question on securities yields. They were down a few basis points in 1Q. Just curious if you could speak to that and where the expense [ph] rates are?","Robert Reilly","Yes. They're actually up a little bit when you take into consideration in the fourth quarter. There was a lot going on in the fourth quarter. But in the securities book, we did have an accounting change that, in effect, decreased the yields in the RMBS, the non-agency RMBS and increased the yields in the CMBS because that may be more than you want to know, we changed the accounting standard to the contractual life of the security. Prior, we used the estimated life. So that moves yields around a little bit and actually elevated them, so yields after adjusting for that for the fourth quarter and then went back to normal this quarter. So our print is down three -- 282 to 279, but when you adjust for it, it might be marginally up.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay.","Robert Reilly","The other thing I would say too our purchases on the securities portfolio on the first quarter were largely treasuries, which carry a little bit of a lower yield. But I'll just add that in.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thank you very much.","Robert Reilly","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Sir, you may proceed with your question.","Brian Klock","Good morning guys.","William Demchak","Hi, Brian.","Brian Klock","So Rob, I want to follow-up on the expense side. On the personnel expenses, can you remind us how much of the first quarter has the seasonal bump that you get from spike and food, and the incentive compensation? And maybe how much that is in the first quarter versus second quarter?","Robert Reilly","That's in the first quarter, for sure, in terms of merit and promotion, so that's definitely there, which tends to be a little bit more first quarter-loaded. The bigger issue just is on a year-over-year and I don't know if you were on the call earlier is the acquisition expenses, so the leasing business as well as the investments that we've made.","Brian Klock","Right. So, I guess, in the \u2013 for the second quarter then, the guidance, they have the low-single-digit growth from the first quarter. So is that the same expectation for personnel? And I guess personnel is somewhat connected by the recent acquisitions?","Robert Reilly","Well, yes, what I would say \u2013 yes, I would say most of the increase in expenses as part of our guidance reflects the higher business activity that we expect in the second quarter, particularly on the fee side.","Brian Klock","Got you. So there's really the mid-single-digit growth you're expecting in fees and this is just going to be \u2013 comp to revenue ratio should be constant, but is just going to go up with that?","Robert Reilly","Yes. I haven't done that math, but that's generally right.","Brian Klock","Okay. All right. Thanks for that. And just a follow-up question, I think, on the loan growth side, I know, earlier you said the mortgage warehouse business, I know, on average was down quarter-over-quarter, when I look at table six on the spot basis that financial services line was up $1.5 billion. Can you tell us what the balances were in each quarter for that warehouse business?","Robert Reilly","I don't have the balances. The balances quarter-over-quarter are down a lot for the warehouse. But that line is \u2013 because that includes a lot of our securitizations which had a strong quarter in the first quarter. So those aren't necessarily two financial services companies, but because of the structure of the facilities categorized that way.","Brian Klock","Okay. And so on a spot basis, the warehouse business was down, not just on average, it was down on spot also?","Robert Reilly","Yes, that's right. So\u2026","William Demchak","You know that?","Robert Reilly","Well, I don't know that. I know \u2013 in terms of the warehouse facility, the elevation was in the fourth quarter, which actually paid down in the fourth quarter, but the average \u2013 sort of the average there. I can get you the number, where we are, but it's on the low side because\u2026","Brian Klock","Okay.","Robert Reilly","\u2026typically in the first quarter.","William Demchak","I can get you that offline, Brian.","Brian Klock","Okay. And so where would you think that securitization activity will probably normalize in the second quarter, so maybe that fit could offset a little bit of the core growth you guys are seeing rather late?","William Demchak","It ought to eventually normalize. So we actually have a pretty good pipeline though.","Robert Reilly","That's right. Yeah. That's right.","Brian Klock","Okay. All right. Thanks. Appreciate your time guys.","Robert Reilly","Yeah. Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed with your question.","Mike Mayo","Hi. My question's on the new market strategy in commercial. So after Denver, Houston, and Nashville this year, what cities might be next? And how many total cities might you expand to?","William Demchak","Well, without naming cities, maybe I'd just let \u2013 you could name them yourselves. And in fact, we look for cities that we are not in that have target corporate population that kind of matches off against our product suite and expertise. And when we started this exercise, we were less than half, I think, of the large markets that have C&I opportunities.","Robert Reilly","Yes. That's right.","William Demchak","Through time, we would hit most of them. I don't know what time means, but we've had success and we will keep rolling out as opportunity presents itself.","Mike Mayo","And I'm sure you can see success, if you look at Dallas, Kansas City, and Minneapolis. You said you've seen success in the new markets. But we, on the outside, we can't see that in the aggregated results, right, because the new investing in Denver, Houston, Nashville is going to be offsetting.","So I guess just generically, what is the time that you invest \u2013 you go from investing to harvesting in a new city? And in aggregate, for the total new market strategy, what's the total time for going from investing to harvesting?","William Demchak","Well, I mean, let's look at the Southeast, I guess, as maybe the best example. So when we bought the RBC branch, is that in effect what we did although we had a branch network there. We grew balances. We met customers. But it's probably three years before we really saw the acceleration and volume pick up, and importantly, cross-sell with fee-based products.","In the newer markets that we've just entered, they don't cost that much money. We get to breakeven pretty quickly; a couple of big deals and you're breakeven in a year. But before they really start to contribute, sort of on a return on capital basis, you're probably looking at that three year.","Robert Reilly","Which is that \u2013 which is the corporate banking sales cycle basically.","William Demchak","Yes.","Mike Mayo","And with the sales\u2026","William Demchak","If we get this \u2013 just to continue, if we get this right, of course, that those investment dollars sort of are continuous. So in effect, we'll be harvesting new markets as we start other ones. So it won't be a net drain. All else equal, we have a small net drain right now because we've done six in two years.","Robert Reilly","Yes, that's right. No, I get it. Look in broader measure, that we're very encouraged in terms of receptivity to our products, our services, our\u2026","William Demchak","Client calls to new clients\u2026","Robert Reilly","Yes, our client interactions.","William Demchak","It's working. Yes.","Robert Reilly","The energy is high.","Mike Mayo","One more follow-up. No, I get it. Look, your expenses are up a little more than $100 million year-over-year. As you buy a bank, you're spending $10 billion, you're spending 100 times more, you spent $100 million. You get tons of questions. I get it. But what is your sales pitch as you go into the new market? Because as you said a lot of these smaller banks that are causing the claim the C&I loan competition, that's all they have are loans, so I guess you have a very good sales pitch against them. But what's your sales pitch against some of the very large banks that have more scale and a broader product suite, and so who are you competing against these new markets?","William Demchak","We compete against JPMorgan and Wells Fargo and BofA in every market we're in.","Robert Reilly","That's nothing new.","William Demchak","That's nothing new. And we go with our A team, in the middle market and small or large corporate with a very credible, capable TM service in a leading against in all the surveys. We go with a capital markets business that is relevant to that type of client. We're not in the equity business. But we\u2019re not trying to do equity deals for the Fortune 100. And it works for us. We win our time and a lot of these things and all the market we are already in. We go into a new market and we do the same thing.","Mike Mayo","All right. Thank you.","William Demchak","Yes.","Operator","We have no further phone questions at this time.","Bryan Gill","Okay. Well, thank you all for joining us on the call this quarter.","William Demchak","Thanks, everybody.","Robert Reilly","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines."]}}
