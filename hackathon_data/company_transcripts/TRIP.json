[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Senior Director of Investor Relations, Will Lyons. You may begin.","Will Lyons","Thanks, Ashley. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to TripAdvisor's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. We appreciate your joining us today. I'm Will Lyons, Senior Director of Investor Relations for TripAdvisor. And joining me on the call today are our CEO, Steve Kaufer; and our CFO, Julie Bradley.","Before we begin, with many of our analysts and investors located in the areas impacted by the recent storm, we thought it best to delay our earnings call until today. Our thoughts are with those affected, and we appreciate everyone's patience.","I'd like to remind you that the estimates and other forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view as of today, November 1, 2012. TripAdvisor disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. Please refer to our -- today's earnings release and TripAdvisor's filing with the SEC for information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. You'll also find reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures discussed on this call in our Q3 earnings release, which is available on our IR site, ir.tripadvisor.com. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense and technology and content expense excludes stock-based compensation, and all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2011.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen Kaufer","Thank you, Will, and welcome, everyone, to today's conference call. Before starting, on behalf of the entire TripAdvisor Media Group family, our thoughts are with everyone that has been impacted by Hurricane Sandy. Special thanks goes out to those of you in the Northeast region who are joining us today.","I'm happy to report that TripAdvisor had a strong third quarter. We generated record quarterly revenue of $212.7 million and adjusted EBITDA of $107.1 million. Across the globe, traffic to our site continues to be strong, as total traffic to TripAdvisor sites grew in the mid-30s and, even more importantly, our hotel shoppers have continued to grow at approximately 30% based on our log files.","I'm also pleased that we made great progress this quarter rapidly innovating the TripAdvisor experience for both our users and our advertising partners alike.","Our core click-based revenue accelerated, growing 15% year-over-year based on continued strong hotel shopper growth. This revenue growth can also be attributed to improvements in our on-site conversion and personalization efforts, offset by a still weak, yet stabilizing, Southern European market. Unique to the third quarter, we estimate that the Summer Olympics had a 2% negative impact on hotel shopper traffic in click-based revenue.","We were also pleased to see a 5% to 6% uplift in click-based revenue very late in the quarter, when we lapped last year's site redesign. We expect this uplift to continue in the coming quarters.","One of the most exciting things to see is the continued strong growth and deep engagement of our growing traveler community. Our marketable members grew over 70% year-over-year to more than 36 million, fueling our robust and growing email campaigns. Our members love sharing their travel experiences with other travelers and friends, and they continue to share content in 21 different languages at a remarkable rate of more than 60 contributions per minute, which equates to over 30 million contributions in a single year.","During the third quarter, we were thrilled to announce content syndication agreements with Best Western and with Wyndham Hotels Group. The Wyndham partnership, which has been expanded to 15 of their hotel brands, also includes a review collection agreement, where Wyndham will encourage their guests to share their experiences through a post-stay email and survey powered by TripAdvisor. Including these latest wins, we now syndicate our traveler reviews to more than 500 major travel partners, including more than 50 hotel chains, reinforcing and enhancing the visibility of the TripAdvisor brand as the de facto standard for travel research.","We also appreciate that tens of thousands of individual business owners around the world proudly display their \"Reviewed on TripAdvisor\" stickers, their certificates of excellence and their Travelers' Choice plaques on-site at their hotels, restaurants and attractions. The brand flywheel is humming, but with TripAdvisor sites accounting for only 10% of online travel uniques, we have a lot of runway left for continued growth and adoption.","At TripAdvisor, we are always innovating our products and extensively testing and discovering new ways to improve site usability and experience for our users. We strive to create the very best experience for every user, on every device, in every geography. You can see this in our social and personalization initiatives, great vehicles through which we learn about our users, their friends and their preferences, all of which enable us to deliver more satisfying, inspiring and customized travel planning experience for everyone.","Along these lines, we continue to leverage the Facebook platform and, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we were pleased to welcome aboard via acquisition the talented team from Wanderfly, whose focus on blending inspiration, personalization and social, nicely complement our ongoing efforts.","In addition to social and personalization, mobile is a key area of focus and investment as we innovate to deliver the best user experience on every device. Year-over-year, we've seen downloads of our smartphone and tablet apps more than double, reaching more than 26 million total downloads. Over the same timeframe, our average monthly mobile uniques are up over 130%, more than 35 million, according to our own log files.","We rolled out an improved tablet interface during the quarter and have seen tablet monetization improve nicely since the -- since earlier this year. It's now more closely resembling desktop, an important trend given that tablet comprises about 3\/4 of our mobile revenue.","On the other hand, smartphone monetization isn't growing as quickly as tablet monetization, which is not surprising to us given the use case and form factor of that device.","During Q3, we began testing hotel meta display on smartphones, an exciting step towards optimizing the user experience. Similar to our Flights product, user interface shows partner prices and availability in line, allowing a hotel shopper to more easily compare booking options. The tests are progressing well, and barring any unforeseen challenges, we expect to roll out hotel meta display to all phone traffic later this quarter.","For us, the phone is all about optimizing the user experience. And we expect over time, this innovation will drive better user engagement, better conversion and therefore, better monetization on the phone's smaller real estate.","Now the logical question to ask is, are we planning to roll out a meta display to all users on all platforms in all geographies. And the answer is we don't know yet. We think the meta experience on phone makes a lot of sense and is worth testing on desktop, but we aren't making any commitments beyond testing at this point.","We've contemplated a meta display for years. And as with all of our product releases, there are 3 main things that we consider: Is it good for the user experience? Is it good for our clients? And what does it do for TripAdvisor economics? We always weigh these factors very carefully, and our objective is to find the solution that works best for all 3.","As it relates to our OTA and hotelier partners, looking at the global landscape, we have seen improvements throughout Q3, especially in our newer international markets.","In the EMEA, we added Geremia hotels to our growing list of partners in the Middle East. In APAC, we added 3 new regional Asian OTAs, including asiarooms. On the bidding side, we started testing property rank reporting with a select set of major OTA clients in 3 test markets in early October. And while that testing has begun, we have not been surprised by any of the results so far. The goal of providing these reports is to allow partners the chance to better understand their ROI on TripAdvisor, and help them rationalize higher per-unit or per-click spend. We expect the test to be successful and expect to have minimum CPC per property thresholds in place in early 2013. At that point, we would consider moving to a worldwide rollout.","During our relatively short history as a public company, you've heard us describe a few initiatives we've undertaken to strategically position TripAdvisor for the long term. From our site redesign to our traffic quality improvement measures, the data sharing with large partners and our new meta interface on smartphones, we remain focused on optimizing user experience, enhancing client satisfaction and maximizing TripAdvisor economics over the long term. This has been TripAdvisor's DNA since inception.","In summary, we had a great quarter. We're squarely on track to deliver, to achieve, our 2012 business objectives and are excited about how we position the business for continued growth in 2013 and beyond.","I'll now turn the call over to Julie, who will provide some color on the Q3 results and our financial outlook.","Julie M. B. Bradley","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Third quarter revenue increased 18% year-over-year to $212.7 million, in line with our expectations.","Assuming constant currency, revenue would have been 4% higher.","Click-based revenue was up 15% year-over-year to $168 million. When comparing year-over-year hotel shopper growth, approximately 30%, to click-based revenue growth, please note that revenue growth this past quarter was negatively impacted by approximately 5% from foreign exchange, 5% to 6% from last year's site redesign and 3% to 5% from the spin-related Expedia pricing changes. Additionally, as Steve mentioned, we believe that our hotel shopper traffic and revenue would have been 2% higher were it not for the lower traffic during the Summer Olympics.","Display-based advertising revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $23.6 million, driven by solid growth in the Americas, offset by weakness in EMEA due to persistent macroeconomic softness in Southern Europe. Assuming constant currency, display-based revenue would have been 2% higher.","Subscription, transaction and other revenue, which includes business listings, vacation rentals and our transaction businesses, had a solid Q3, growing 53% to $21.1 million. In business listings, new sales reps are ramping globally, and we expect to see continued productivity improvements as we enter 2013.","As it relates to geographic mix, despite macroeconomic challenges and unfavorable foreign exchange movement, non-U.S. revenue was 50% of total revenue during the third quarter, compared to 49% in Q2 and 47% in the third quarter of 2011.","In general, we saw click growth accelerate in our core markets. And on the pricing side, we saw stabilizing to improving pricing abroad. Specifically in EMEA, we saw accelerating growth in the U.K. despite a persistently tough pricing environment. Also, Southern Europe, although still weak, showed encouraging signs of pricing stabilization. Our newer Russian market remains in hyper-growth mode, albeit growing off a smaller base. In our fast-growing Latin America and APAC markets, we saw continued strong hotel shopper growth and solid pricing trends, driven by stronger coverage, traffic acquisition, brand building and content collection initiatives. Notably, Brazil remains in a hyper-growth mode as well. And to put it into perspective, it's fast approaching Spain and Italy in terms of click-based revenue.","On the expense side, non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses were $66.5 million or 31% of revenue for the quarter, consistent sequentially on a percentage of revenue basis. Given that Q4 is our seasonally lowest revenue quarter, we expect to see deleveraging in our non-GAAP sales and marketing spend. This translates into sales and marketing spend in the high-30s to low-40s as a percent of revenue for the fourth quarter and mid-30s as a percentage of revenue for full year 2012. Moving forward, we continue to prioritize traffic diversification, international expansion and a hotel shopper growth as we identify underleveraged marketing channels to meet these growth objectives.","Non-GAAP tech and content expenses were $20.3 million or 10% of revenue for the quarter, and non-GAAP G&A expenses were $16 million or 8% of revenue. Both were in line with our expectations, and we expect these expense lines to stay relatively constant on a dollar basis in Q4.","Our Q3 effective tax rate of 34.4% was higher than we expected due to an income mix shift towards jurisdictions with higher statutory rates, as well as an increase in valuation allowance for one of our U.S. subsidiaries. For the balance of 2012, we expect our effective tax rate to remain relatively consistent with our year-to-date rate.","Cash flow from operations was strong at $76.5 million or 36% of revenue for the quarter. We continue to expect full year 2012 cash flow from operations to track with adjusted EBITDA after providing for interest and taxes, or low-30s as a percentage of revenue. In terms of headcount, we ended Q3 with 1,483 employees, up from 1,444 employees at June 30 and 1,196 at the end of Q3 2011.","With that, let me turn to our outlook for the balance of the year. Given our year-to-date performance, we continue to expect 2012 total revenue growth in the high teens. Driven mainly by continued strong hotel shopper growth and the tailwinds created from lapping last year's site redesign, we now expect click-based revenue growth to be in the high teens for the full year.","While fourth quarter-to-date volume and conversion remain strong, pricing continues to be a headwind given the persistent macroeconomic softness overseas, as well as the fact that we are still comping higher pre-spin Expedia pricing. We continue to expect low double-digit annual revenue growth for display-based revenue, as it faces a tough Q4 comp based on unusually strong demand in Q4 2011, which may not reoccur. We also expect full year subscription, transaction and other revenue growth to be consistent with our year-to-date results.","Based on our continued profitability outperformance, we now expect full year 2012 adjusted EBITDA growth in the high single digits.","We are in the midst of our 2013 planning process and will provide our expectations for next year on our Q4 call.","In closing, our year-to-date performance keeps us well on track to achieve our 2012 goals. We will now open the call up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Could you just talk a little bit more about kind of the traffic acquisition strategy and how anything may have changed versus what you talked about last quarter and, ultimately, kind of how you're thinking about it going forward?","Stephen Kaufer","Sure, Mike. Thanks for the question. I'd say we had put the plan in place when we spoke last time in terms of reducing some of the SEM spend on traffic that wasn't profitable when we measured it through to conversions, and that has remained the plan. It was a relatively easy change for us to make back then, and so the search engine team has been focused on continuing to grow that channel and they've had some success. That's still just one piece of the overall picture. We have essentially all of the different traffic acquisition vehicles and customer acquisition vehicles in terms of email to marketable members ongoing with respect to Facebook, affiliates and all the rest of the mechanisms by which we can attract traffic to our site. Shorter answer is not much of a change from prior quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Laura Martin of Needham & Company.","Laura A. Martin - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to check in, Steve, it sounds like maybe we've had some movement on mobile. You said that desktop is 3\/4 of total mobile usage. My recollection, my estimate there, was about 70% pricing as a percent of desktop and smartphones at about 10% of pricing. It sounds like maybe both of those are getting better. Is that a fair readthrough from your comments?","Stephen Kaufer","Well, let me try to paraphrase. We haven't actually shared the specific breakout between desktop and mobile in terms of traffic. What we're saying is the -- when the phrase mobile is used, we often refer to both tablet and phone and that 3\/4 of the revenue generated from tablet and phone remains on the tablet. We have seen some improvements in our monetization rate on the tablet. That's all good. And it's kind of what I had told you we expected to see over time as the tablet usage much more closely resembles desktop. On the phone, we haven't seen a meaningful change in the monetization rate, i.e., it's still a very small percentage of desktop. And we think it's form factor. We think it's in market activity. We think it's folks who are thinking about the trip, checking out some hotels and some whatever, who just aren't ready to actually spend the money right then and there because our typical usage pattern is not, \"Last minute, landed in the city, need a hotel room,\" that some other apps may have. So we've introduced, from a testing perspective, meta display to the smartphones because we think that's just a much better experience when someone wants to check the prices and do that base level of research. Because we're showing the prices in line, we think the conversion rate of the leads will be higher downstream. So the overall monetization rate of that display will be better for us. And I'm just cautioning that in that mobile environment, a, it's a small part of our traffic; b, it's a poorly monetizing, small part of our traffic. So the shift from the current monetization model to a meta display on phone isn't a particularly material financial event for us.","Operator","Our next question is from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan.","Kaizad Gotla - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Kaizad Gotla in for Doug. I was wondering if you could just give us some color on the feedback you're getting around the traffic quality changes and the new bidding system. Any feedback from OTAs that you're getting would be helpful.","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. So it's always kind of hard to parse out what they're saying and what they're doing. We've seen some cases where partners have lifted their bids. Is it seasonal? Is it more hungry for reach? Or is it they can afford more because our traffic is better? So I don't, unfortunately, have a whole lot to offer by way of direct feedback. In terms of the bid piece, we haven't really changed anything in terms of how partners can bid on our traffic. What we've really done -- started to do in these tests markets is provide more transparency about what their bid currently gets them in terms of the rank reporting. And as I said, we -- some partners have started to use that information. There hasn't been any meaningful changes that we've been able to detect, either up or down, with respect to that having a material impact on us. We can say that the partners that have some of this information are grateful for it. They appreciate us giving it to them, and it's working their way through their systems as to how they might be able to take advantage of it.","Operator","Our next question is from Nat Schindler of Bank America Merrill Lynch.","Nathaniel H. Schindler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","One, your tax rate of 34.5% and -- or even the 30% that you've had historically, is still quite a bit higher than other Internet companies that are running about 50% domestic and 50% international. Is there a chance that you can get that lower, much closer to the Google or\/eBay rates that they see in the, near the 20% by different Irish, Dutch Sandwich things? And on a second question, given the last 2 quarters at 49% and then 50% this quarter EBITDA margins, have you pretty -- are you willing to kind of throw out your 42% to 47% EBITDA margin guidance that you have -- you gave when you did the spin?","Julie M. B. Bradley","It's Julie. I'll take those. So first, on the tax rate, and one thing to keep in mind, up until December of -- end of December of last year, we were part of Expedia and part of their tax planning and mobile IP strategy. And now that we are a stand-alone company and have our own tax department and are looking at where our IP is located and what makes the best business sense, we're definitely looking into that. One thing that also plays into TripAdvisor's negative impact on the rates is that we're headquartered in Massachusetts, which has a higher tax rate than where some of the other players may be located. So we're working on it, I'd love a lower tax rate, and it is definitely part of our strategy going forward. Regarding the EBITDA margins, I want to remind you that we did not give that. That 42% to 47% was not guidance and, or a long-term target model. It was just to illustrate the effect of the spin on our 2010 numbers. So we've had things like the additional G&A costs, the decrease in Expedia pricing. Those -- that impact was applied against 2010 just to give an illustrative model. We're in the process of -- we've had a lot of movements in 2013 -- excuse me, in 2012. We are actively looking for investment opportunities for sales and marketing, for traffic diversification and so forth and -- even from quarter to quarter, we are able to spend less or more in sales and marketing. And we're looking at what 2000 -- we're in the planning side for 2013, and we'll come back to you on that in -- on our Q4 call.","Operator","Our next question is from Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wondering if you could comment a bit. It looked like we saw big ramp in Expedia's general direct marketing expense in terms of year-over-year growth in the third quarter. And obviously, they've made it clear that they're adjusting spend levels vis-\u00e0-vis, you guys. But I was just wondering, at what point do you think you can be participating in some of that growth again from Expedia? And where do you think they're spending that incremental share as they accelerate spend?","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. Perfectly fair, interesting question. Unfortunately, I really don't have any insight into where Expedia is spending their funds on the marketing side. I would expect as our -- presuming our traffic continues to grow at the rate we have been growing, one would naturally assume that Expedia would be spending more with us in coming years. We've gone through the step function. We've brought things down to what we believe are much closer to kind of market rates. And now it's a bidding environment. And to the degree to which we can get everyone to be bidding up for the traffic we have, we'll see that increased spend. I think Expedia, like our other clients, are very smart on the traffic acquisition side. So we remain, to the best of our knowledge, an incredibly important, valuable partner of theirs in terms of buying direct leads. Their sales and marketing line, I believe, encompasses quite a bit more than just the direct marketing. So in that -- in their marketing spend, it could well be in other areas that we don't participate in: TV, radio, whatever it might be. You'd have to ask them about that part.","Operator","Our next question is from Anthony DiClemente of Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just, as we look into 2013, I just wonder if you guys can bridge through for us the lapping or the anniversary effect of a number of the changes that you've already alluded to on this call and how we should think about maybe even just modeling through things like lapping through the CPC step-down, the site de-cluttering. Can you call any of those out as we model through for even just the first half of 2013, on revenue at least? That will be helpful for us.","Julie M. B. Bradley","So we tried to provide you some of that bridge in my prepared remarks by calling out things that were either onetime or not normal course of business. So FX. And we forecast in constant currency. So anything that we talk about on a forward-looking basis is using exchange rates as of today. So we're not trying to predict what's going to happen there. So you can make your own decision. So we've had some, just looking at Q3, some onetime, such as the Olympics. So that's 2% on overall -- on CPC tax-linked revenue. And when you extrapolate that out, it's probably about 1.5% off of our total year-over-year growth rate. The site redesign is probably the largest one. We -- as Steve mentioned, we lapped that at the end of Q3. At that time, we were able to clearly see that it had negatively impacted our year-over-year growth rate by about 5% to 6%. So like we would expect that trend to continue forward into Q4 and beyond. And then the other mention that we made was the Expedia pricing. Now that contract anniversaries the date of the spin. And we had said that originally, it's probably a 3% to 5% negative impact on revenue. As of the last couple of quarters, we've been saying it's at the high end of that range. So that -- we'll anniversary that at the end of this quarter.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And Julie, that's all helpful. One follow-up on that last one. Did you have a -- was there a spending floor that was in place? And is there -- should we be concerned like about the possibility of another step-down after lapping the expiry of the post-spin contract? Like can that -- can Expedia spend step down again? Or is that likely or unlikely?","Stephen Kaufer","I think we put the agreement in place to make for a smooth transition from where both sides didn't quite know what would happen when the companies were unbundled, if you will. We think the prices have gotten much closer to market rates, so we're not forecasting a big step-down function. Regardless of what we forecast, truly, it is a bid environment. So there are meaningful questions one gets to ask Expedia and all the other bidders, in terms of how much are they interested in growing their share, what are the competitive forces that are going to get the bids to go up. So yes, as Julie said, we anniversary the agreement. But obviously, we've known it's been coming for quite some time.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Now going back to the property rank reporting data that -- where you have the test -- 3 test markets I think you said, could you envision a situation where you would not elect to roll that out widely? It would seem like very valuable data, irrespective of whether an OTA partner has explicitly asked for it or not. And then secondly, wondering if you could comment on kind of the lifetime value of your reviews? You continue to add review content kind of hand-over-fist. But at what point does the value kind of expire a little bit? I mean, the 6-year-old review is clearly not as valuable as the 6-month-old review. I'm wondering if you could just kind of comment on those trends.","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. Two good questions. So on the rank reporting, I haven't heard any feedback from any of our test partners that say, \"Thanks, but no thanks, we weren't really interested in this information.\" I think we more hear, \"Wow, it's a lot of information. It's a lot to digest.\" And to put it in perspective, if we have a client that's bidding on 100,000 properties times, call it, 20 different markets, that's just a lot of data to digest and make sense of. So we're having to be measured in our rollout per our client request, basically. So I don't -- it's a little hard for me to imagine a situation where over time, we don't have this information available to everyone. But I'm a lot more cautious about trying to predict in which quarter it will be both available and consumed for everyone. To your second part of your question, lifetime value of the reviews, we heartily agree that the 6-year-old review is perhaps nice to have on the site because it mentions something that's unique to that review, a tip in the neighborhood or something like that, climbed on top of the hill to watch a beautiful sunset. The 6-year-old review really isn't part of our popularity index calculation anymore either, because it's so old and so much can change in the 6 years. Similarly, we have some hotels north of 8,000 reviews. And they may be all current, but you still don't need 8,000 to have a lot of liquidity of opinion for that property. The beauty of what we're able to do with generating so many more reviews is sort of provide fantastic coverage on not only the top properties in the city, but kind of all the properties in the city, in the country, all the restaurants. So it's getting to the point where it's tough to find a hotel with less than 50 reviews. And that's what we're getting pretty excited about because everyone can look at 5 reviews on a property and say, \"What's the big deal?\" With 50, you start to really understand what you're going to get when you stay there. And the same applies to restaurants and the same applies to tours and attractions and museums and kind of everything else that goes into what folks are looking at. So sure, if you took the 6-year-old reviews off the site, no one would notice. The volume was so small anyways, it practically doesn't matter. We keep them on there just as a convenience function for our current customers.","Operator","Our next question is from Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs.","Heath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was just wondering if you could give us a sense of what you're seeing from a usage perspective within mobile, whether or not as the medium matures for you, whether you're seeing more transactional activity within mobile versus research and whether or not the -- how different the segments, hotel versus activities, are within your mobile channels versus desktop?","Stephen Kaufer","Well, I'm pretty sure that the activity is distinctly different. There's more non-hotel activity on the phone versus the desktop or tablet. Monetization is certainly -- a lot fewer people are clicking off to see the price, perhaps because they know when they do, that function on our mobile device right now, on the phone, it's a pretty painful experience in order to get back to the app and all that. So we'll let you know on the next call how the meta experience is being accepted by the user on the smartphone device and whether that's in fact encouraging more commerce clicks and in turn, more conversions. I still kind of stand by my original comments in terms of the use case of the mobile phone. While some other apps or the OTA apps, if you find yourself in a city and you need a hotel room and you haven't done any advance planning, you're just probably more in the, \"Hey, find me something close to where I am and I'm going to book it,\" and an OTA web app can -- an OTA app can do that for you quite well. We're in the more expensive, the more time-consuming, the more enjoyable research experience, which generally happens long before the day of booking. So we believe our usage will continue to grow dramatically in mobile. We believe we'll be able -- the phone specifically. We believe we'll be able to grow our monetization rate. But I am personally skeptical that we'll ever achieve the monetization rate that we have on desktop on the phones purely because of that usage case.","Operator","Our next question is from Herman Leung of Susquehanna International Group.","Deepak Mathivanan - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Great. This is Deepak sitting in for Herman. So just a question on Facebook as a channel. So could you discuss how the ROI from Facebook as a channel was during the quarter? Maybe give some qualitative color on that. And then what other ways, maybe some social ways, in which you can acquire customers using the Facebook channel?","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. So Facebook remains a meaningful channel to grow our brand awareness and to grow our membership. I've tried to be reasonably clear that we don't view it as a very large traffic acquisition channel, certainly not compared to a channel like search. So you have folks on Facebook that are engaged in sharing and learning about what their friends are into, posting photos and the rest. And at many times, they're interested in interacting with our brand, with our Cities I've Visited or seeing a status update from their friends about the trips that they've taken. The Cities I've Visited app, to use it, you're joining TripAdvisor, and you're telling us something about yourself, namely all the different places that you've been. You're also giving us your friend network so that we can share all those places that you've been as data when your friends come and browse on TripAdvisor. To recap, Facebook as a member acquisition channel is quite strong for us because we spend a certain amount to advertise our map and TripAdvisor applications, we get a certain uptake, that's at a somewhat expensive rate. That's sort of qualitative because it's just a member, it's not a travel booking yet. But because of what those folks are doing with the app, it's generating invitations to other users, it's generating status feeds, it's generating Open Graph items and I can go through the laundry list of Facebook viral channels, which in turn are generating a lot more members for us for free. We're not having to pay to acquire. So we continue our spend on that channel because it helps us grow our membership and it helps us grow our social content, namely knowing where your friends have been to in order to make progress on our social and personalization efforts, which I've touched upon. So think of it as building a huge database of travelers, travelers who happen to be Facebook connected. We're learning more and more about them, whether or not they've been to TripAdvisor yet, we're teaching them about TripAdvisor, and we're getting the click-through rates and the emails that say, \"Hey, they're interested in this. So they're coming back.\" And then the longer-term question is and through that mechanism, will they be converted to the more domain-direct, the more branded association. We see positive signs, but the jury is still out by several quarters, in our opinion, as to whether that's going to move the needle as much as we hope going forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Nowak of Nomura.","Brian Nowak - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","The first one is with Expedia kind of looking to grow the agency business in the U.S., I was wondering if you could talk about any differences in cost per click or monetization that you see in agency-dominated markets versus merchant hotel-dominated markets. And then the second one, I'm curious to hear about -- I know there's been a lot of focus in the kind of the conversion of your OTA partners as a focal point in the last quarter. So I was kind of curious about any commentary about the direction of the ROI and your partner conversion this quarter versus last quarter?","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. So on the Expedia agency business, we're certainly aware of their offering choice to their consumers. We don't have inside information, but it stands to reason one of the opportunities for them is to increase their conversion rate even if the margin or the finances behind it might be different. And I say might because again, I'm not part of it. Our respective interests are perfectly aligned because if offering the pay at checkout feature improves conversion, then they're making more money per -- not necessarily per booking but per lead I send them because of the higher conversion rate. Therefore, they can afford to pay me as much as they were before or even more if they dip into some of their efficiency numbers. So we don't view the percentage uptake of their agency business as bad in any way should it be strong in certain markets. If it helps -- another way to look at it is if it helps them be competitive in certain markets, where they didn't have the product offering before, fantastic, because then they'll be able to bid more for traffic in those markets. Again, the conversion rate is expected to make up for any loss in merchant revenues. It's actually a little bit related to the OTA conversion, the second part of your question. So when we look at the leads that we send to our clients, I don't really ask them, \"Are my leads better converting than a Google or somebody else?\" I look to see, on a per-dollar spend basis, \"Do we generate more profit for you folks than your other channels?\" And we continue to hear that our clients are bidding independently, i.e., they're not favoring TripAdvisor over Google or vice versa. They'll spend wherever they get the next best ROI. So if a TripAdvisor lead converts at twice the rate of a Google lead, then they're probably paying twice as much for it. Then the converse is true, too. Will comparing the actual CPC or the actual conversion independently, not really the question you want to ask, it's the \"Hey, how's the efficiency of TripAdvisor as a traffic source to these clients?\" And while every one of our clients, no doubt, would like an even more efficient source, they're all free to lower their bids at any point, which will get them less traffic but presumably a little bit more efficient. And they're not doing that. So they've -- it's always changing, but it seems like they've found a happy balance in terms of the efficiency that they're willing to spend on TripAdvisor and the conversion that, that drives.","Operator","And I'm not showing any further questions in the queue.","Stephen Kaufer","All right then. Well, as we closed with before, we're very proud of the quarter, and we see trends going forward that we very much like. I want to thank everyone for joining our call today. And I really want to thank all the TripAdvisor employees around the globe for their hard work throughout the quarter, and we know we can count on it going forward. So we've made some great progress on our growth initiatives, very excited about it. And we look forward to updating all of you on our progress in early 2013. Thanks again.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect.

Please go ahead.","Will Lyons","Thanks, Blair. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to TripAdvisor's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Steve Kaufer, CEO, and Julie Bradley, CFO.","After the market closed today, we distributed our Q3 earnings release on our Investor Relations website, located at ir.tripadvisor.com. In the release, you will find reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures discussed on this call. Also, on our Investor Relations website, you'll find supplemental financial information, which includes certain non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call as well as other performance matrices.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that estimates and other forward-looking statements included in this call represent the Company's views as of today, November 5, 2015.

I'm going to update you on our progress on how we are developing the best products for users, expanding our strong global platform to more partners and building a bigger and better business over the long-term.","Our Q3 results clearly show the major impact currency headwinds are having on business. Total revenue grew 17% and adjusted EBITDA grew 9% or 25% and 26% growth respectively in constant currency. As I'll describe in more detail later in my remarks, the results and business outlook also highlight that we are moving quickly in pursuit of our long-term goals to make TripAdvisor a great place to discover and book the things that make a trip memorable.","First we'll talk about how TripAdvisor's consumers value proposition continues to strengthen in content, community and mobile. In content with 290 million reviews and opinions on 5.3 million businesses around the world TripAdvisor products are indispensable travel planning tools. Member growth has accelerated this year and most members are contributing content at a record pace of 190 per minute, the fastest growth in our history. This puts us on track to add another 100 million reviews and opinions over the next 12 months making our travel planning products and tools fresher, richer and better for every user demand, every device in every geography.","Our global travel community also continues to grow its essence by unique monthly visitor growth of 23% and hotel shopper growth of 16%. Travelers can find information on more than 3.6 million restaurants and attractions, so it's no surprise that unique visitors to these pages continues to grow quickly. We attribute much of this growth engagement to mobile with TripAdvisor's helpful reviews, tips, photos and guides are the perfect travel content. Mobile usage makes up more than half of our traffic, in this quarter we reached more than 230 million app downloads across our brands including 215 million downloads of our [top range] TripAdvisor app.","We are monetizing better on that platform as well. As this quarter's hotel shoppers on phone monetized a 25% the rate of those on desktop which is up nearly 40% since two years ago. Perhaps more importantly, this speaks through the large mobile monetization opportunity in front of us. Mobile gives us the yet another powerful way to connect directly with consumers. Continuous iteration and innovation here is key, and every TripAdvisor team is actively engaged in delivering more value to users and partners on these devices.","On any device TripAdvisor users are close to making a purchase. In fact the recent Oxford Economic study estimates that TripAdvisor influenced more than 10% of global travel transactions in 2014, whether it's a hotel stay for long weekend, a reservation for two at a restaurant or tickets for hop on and hop off city tour, these are extremely powerful moments for advertisers. As travel purchases tend to be extremely nuanced, contractual and episodic.","TripAdvisor delivered the right ad with right reservation opportunity to the right user at just the right moment at massive global scale. As proud as we are of this growing influence, we believe that our revenue share represents only a small percentage of the transaction value we're driving for our partners. We are in year one of a multiyear voyaged [for this] monetization week and we continue to make excellent progress.","In hotels, Wyndham Hotel Group and the Priceline Group are the latest of the growing list of more than 70 hotels chains, groups and OTA partners who wants the power of bookings on our platform including seven of the top 10 hotel brands in the world. In addition, in particular, adding the Priceline Group to the platform is a huge win for our travelers, as their high quality room descriptions in many languages, multicurrency payment capabilities, great room pricing and stellar customer service enables us to accelerate our international rollout in instant booking over the coming year.","We expect to launch the booking.com brand first with the Priceline and [indiscernible] brands to follow next year. Integration work has already begun and I can tell you that I love what I'm seeing. And once we are fully live, we expect users will be able to seamlessly book more than 400,000 properties on our platform in more than a dozen languages. We are also helping independent hoteliers to drive more bookings on our platform. We are working with more than 130 internet booking engine partners and we expect to connect many of their hotel clients over time.","Regardless of partner size as global reach, instant booking can drive reservations at a fair cost, solve the media attribution issues that are persisted within the internet for years and enable our hotelier clients to develop a more direct relationship with more travelers. Our Marriott integration system is a perfect example. After the signing the contract in June, we completed the rollout in less than two months and we have seen great early results including improved conversion in more bookings for Marriott to our platform.","As we add more globally recognized partners, we are further optimizing the booking experience on their site as well. This includes developing their own funds and management system for hotel and saving users' credit cards information to make bookings faster and easier. [At the tip of my head], the entire instant booking team who has met this challenge head on towards a meaningful conversion improvements over the past year. Based upon these improvements and given how important an instant booking is to our long-term goals we accelerated the rolled out our users in two of our largest markets in September.","We believe this accelerated rolled out schedule contributed headwinds of approximately $10 million to revenue and $8 million to EBITDA during Q3. We expect to be live in more major markets in the next year and we'll continue to carefully monitor the opportunity costs associated with this faster international rollout. We know the instant book experience is working with users and partners. The third piece of the puzzle is monetization for TripAdvisor while not yet accretive, we believe that the faster we transition and teach travelers that they can book on TripAdvisor the quicker we can close the monetization week.","Fortunately, we have extremely smart and motivated teams who are up to the challenge. We have successfully transitioned away from popup windows. We successfully transitioning to metasearch and I know that you will tackle this transition just as where. On the marketing side, we are continuing to more deeply integrate the claims compare book message into our online and offline channels. A big channel for us this past year has been TV. While we have seen success in many countries, so we are pleased with our TV efforts to live [indiscernible] of the years, you decided to put this marketing channel on foreignness for 2016, while we focus more on the global rollout of instant booking. Instead, we expect to increase our investment in some of our other global brand building efforts while we also better leverage our community both on the consumer and B2B site to fuel our book on TripAdvisor initiatives.","In addition to our opportunity in hotels, we are matching more consumers and businesses in our fast growing attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals category. Our content is clearly gives us a unique understanding of travelers especially in attractions and restaurants and we can drive more users of the exact moment that they are looking fine in both a great place to eat or memorable things to do. These businesses constitute our other segment which generated revenues of $75 million in the third quarter and $217 million on a trailing 12-month basis. Over that timeframe, we have been aggressively reinvesting profits to drive market share gains. We are just in the first year of what we have outlined as the three to five-year growth initiative.","Shifting gears, as we announced a couple weeks ago, the team and I are looking forward to welcoming Ernst Teunissen to TripAdvisor, which brings significant financial and operational expertise as a global CFO and a corporate strategist and I look forward to collaborating with him as we pursue significant growth opportunities ahead. He officially starts next and Julie will be with us through November 20 to ensure a smooth transition.","Before I close 2015 is a tremendous for our book on TripAdvisor initiative. While still in the early days of this evolution, we continue to make tremendous strides towards our long-term growth objectives. In closing, this is Julie's final earnings call with us and I want to thank her again for all of her contributions over the past four years. I'd also like to thank all of our employees around the globe to build the products that users love in a more valuable platform for advertisers and positioning TripAdvisor for the long-term success.","And with that here is Julie.","Julie M.B. Bradley","Thank you Steve and good afternoon everyone. Results were very healthy despite significant year-over-year currency headwinds. This quarter, total revenue grew 17%. Q3 adjusted EBITDA grew 9%. In constant currency, Q3 total revenue and EBITDA growth would have been 25% and 26% respectively.","Our core hotel segment posted 8% revenue growth, or 15% in constant currency, an EBITDA margin held stable at 36%. Digging in, Q3 click-based revenue grew 6% or 14% in constant currency driven by 16% hotel shopper growth and offset by continued pricing pressure which includes impacts from currency translation, lower CPC pricing and product changes we've made such as the decision to accelerate our instant booking rollout in U.S. and U.K. our two largest markets.","Revenue for our hotel shopper growth reflects these headwinds as it decelerated to negative 10%. Normalizing for this significant year-over-year currency translation headwinds revenue per hotel shopper growth would have been better though still slightly negative for the quarter due to a lower CPC pricing and the accelerated instant book rollout.","As a housekeeping item, note that during the third quarter we improved our counting methodology for unique users and hotel shoppers and have provided the [recasted] figures back through 2014 in the supplemental financial information tables which are available on our IR site.","Our display-based business performed very well as revenue growth reaccelerated to 20%. These strong results were driven by 22% growth in ad impression sold and with a strength in the U.S. and EMEA markets with hotel, destination marketing organizations and OTA customers in particular. Our display team continues to innovate this product offering delivering great value to clients.","As the currency environment stabilizes, we expect that more clients will be a position to leverage our scale in a robust data management platform in their global addition campaigns.","Other segment revenue grew 92% in Q3, primarily driven by attraction and restaurant acquisition and partially offset by currency translation headings and lower average order value for international travelers. Other segment adjusted EBITDA margins improved to positive 12% for the quarter driven by high revenue seasonality in our attraction and vacation rental businesses. We've operated this segment at EBITDA breakeven over the trailing 12 months, and continued to reinvest aggressively in our products and sales efforts to drive long-term market share gains. We expect to see the typical seasonal step down in Q4 and Q3 results while strong should not be taking as a new run rate in the near-term. Over the long-term, we believe margins will expand as we gain greater global scale.","As for expenses, selling and marketing delevered primarily due to top line impacts from our accelerated instant booking rollout an increased investment in our other segment businesses. We also had a full quarter of expenses related to our 2014 attraction acquisition last year, and we continued to invest heavily in sales and marketing resources to pursue our long-term growth objectives in our newer category. I will note that the quarter also contain approximately $20 million in television advertising spend which was consistent with both our Q4 investment as well as the year ago quarter. As Steve mentioned, we've decided to put this investment on pause in 2016 and intend to expand our investment in other brand marketing channels as we rolled out instant book more broadly.","On the other expense lines, general and administrative expenses levered slightly and [checking] content grew in line with revenue as we continue to actively seek talents to pursue our growth initiatives.","On the bottom line, GAAP net income per diluted share was $0.51 which included the sale of one of our Chinese subsidiaries which contributed $0.12 to our GAAP diluted EPS this quarter. This gain on sale was not included in our non-GAAP net income results of $0.53 per diluted share as the gain is not considered indicative of our ongoing operational results.","Moving to headcount, we ended Q3 with approximately 3,000 employees, up 9% driven primarily by the investments we're making to grow our attraction and restaurant businesses. As for taxes, our Q3 GAAP effective tax rate of 25% decreased primarily due to the changes in full year forecasted geographical mix including a non-taxable gain related to the sale of Kuxun one of our Chinese subsidiaries. We continued to expect GAAP effective tax rate for the full year to be approximately 27% to 28%.","We generated $8 million of cash from operations during the quarter or 2% of revenue. This slide continues to highlight the growth and seasonality of our transaction businesses where we collect cash at the time of booking and pay us to suppliers at the time of stay or when the ticket is used.","CapEx for the quarter was $39 million or 9% of revenue, driven primarily by leasehold improvements, capitalized website development and data center expansion to support our traffic growth. CapEx should sat down significantly as a percentage of revenue moving forward now that we have taken occupancy of our new corporate headquarters. We now expect 2015 capital expenditures to be 7% of revenue. We continue to run a very capital efficient business.","Liquidity remained strong as well with our cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities balance of $730 million. We also have an undrawn balance of $708 million from our $1 billion credit facility in just over $100 million remaining under our existing share repurchased [head]. Our capital allocation philosophy remains unchanged as we look to be opportunistic when it comes to making organic and inorganic discretionary growth investments. Online travel remains competitive and we tend to view investments through a long-term lens versus near-term payback.","Looking forward Q4 will have a full quarter impact from our accelerated instant booking rollout and we expect to begin on boarding booking.com later this quarter. As such we now expect 2015 revenue growth in the high-teens and slightly negative EBITDA growth. This revised outlook attempts to be appropriately conservative to reflect these changes as well as foreign exchange rates as of today. This outlook does not assume future positive or negative FX movement conversion or monetization improvements.","We expect to rollout instant book faster over the coming periods which is great for our travelers and our long-term business prospect as we begin to plug the monetization leak. Over the near-term, it poses some forecasting challenges as we enable more properties rollout to many more users around the globe and continue to improve the monetization of the product. As Ernst settles in over the coming months, the team will determine how to evolve communications on future expectations as well as the metrics by which progress will be measured. The business is heading in a right direction and I have enjoyed being part of the journey. I want to personally thank Steve and the entire TripAdvisor team for a great four years.","We will now open the call up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Lloyd Walmsley","Thanks. So Steve you mentioned, I think part of the reason for the accelerated international rollout of instant book was kind of meaningful improvements you are making. I think in conversion or monetization, but maybe just the product. But can you give us kind of a sense for how fast the arc is in terms of improvement of conversion and what you need to get fix to get the revenue per user of instant book up, can you kind of map that arc versus the pace of their rollout in the new market. And kind of when you think this might be accretive or if or when you think this might be accretive to revenue per hotel shopper? And then second question, if I can. When you're talking about pausing the TV ad campaign that we invest impart in other brand advertising, should we assume kind of similar levels of overall marketing spend just shifted to other forms like, is it outdoor, can you kind of give us some color on the plan there? That would be great. Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer","Thanks Lloyd, excellent questions. So the arc of version improvement, I would say, has been fairly steady since we launched over a year ago, month-in, month-out, sometimes week-in, week-out, we're just making a constant improvement. I know heads up coming up is kind of a step change because we are adding a Priceline, super excited about this deal with the Priceline Group because they offer a great brand, global inventory, tremendous content kind of which -- I talked about this several times in the past, very rich win description and a lot of information that our travelers are telling us they want to see on our site before they hit the book button, and at times they have to leave our site even when they have gone into the instant booking flow because we haven't been able to provide everything that the customer is looking for. booking.com or Expedia for that matter have tremendous content and been able to provide that information that's why the conversion rates on their sites are as good as they are. This deal allows us to bring in that rich information into our instant booking flow and so we don't know the impact on the conversion rate and we'll know shortly as we roll it out, but that's really going to be a big difference maker in terms of the slow and steady improvement that we've made, up come potential step change when we launch with Priceline Group.","Having said that, we faced a choice last year in booking for this past year in looking at the international rollout because it's been a challenge for us to figure out how to get the content that we need in all the languages and support all the currency types, all of a sudden that challenge is addressed for us in the Priceline deal, and so it makes it just technically or practically feasible to roll it out. It adds additional uncertainty in our forecasting because while we have the decent amount of experience now in U.S. and U.K., we don't quite know how instant book is going to flowing in, in France, in Japan, all throughout age, all throughout all the other markets that we look to roll it out in Priceline has great content, the partnership will work in all the countries, but we don't know the conversion impact relative to the [matter] prices that we have.","Coming back up another level, we are really excited about what this does for the business. We've always said that, we're ready to go it alone without an OTA partner because it was the right thing for the business. That was true, having Priceline in the fold now, just allows us to be able to go faster on the path that we were headed down anyways. And that faster has always been pretty important to us. It is a big transition. We belong to a several in the past and we are looking to forward to not only the week-by-week improvement with the step change functions that we hope this Priceline deal will deliver.","To the second part of your question television. One of the reasons that we wanted to talk about television in this call is that, TV is often a long-term -- it's an advance buy, it's something that you need to plan in advance. So while we're telling folks that we have decided to pullback for 2016 at least, we don't want anyone to think that, hey, we're just taking all that money and hanging onto it. We will be attempting. We will be spending some of the money in other channels and so we don't want anyone's model to just drop to the bottom line. We haven't decided how much and of course all throughout the year, we will be evaluating opportunities as they come up, but TV was such a long-term commitment, we haven't updated anything into that specific decision.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mark Mahaney","Yeah, I wanted to follow-up a little bit more on the TV campaign and the thought behind kind of putting that on pause. You said a pretty long-term orientation in your thinking, So can you spend a little bit more time, has there been any shortfalls in the ROI that you expected to see in a TV campaign and therefore you want to do a revamp of it or is it just a matter of making sure resources are correctly allocated to the IB accelerated rollout? Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer","I have been pleased with what we have seen on TV. I considerate a pause for 2016, redirection into some other channels that I know we will look at because the IB rollout or the success in plugging the leak doesn't actually require more traffic to come in to our site, we already have 350 million users in our [sequence] with all of that traffic and we still think half of which being hotel traffic that's such a great opportunity to plug the leak, and if we can do that and if we can monetize those hotel shoppers to the degree that any other OTA monetizes the hotel shoppers, that's a really big win for us. And while TV was meant to help that, we feel we actually already have the traveler on our site and by doing other things on our site we can also affect that plug the leak. So we have an entire global world to look at and so, an extremely global TV educational campaign is hundreds of millions of dollars, but we already have the traffic that's live and with the Priceline Group and our ability to rollout instant book globally we want to sort of concentrate our fire power on delivering that plain compare book message in plugging that leak after travelers already on our site.","Mark Mahaney","Okay, thank you, Steve.","Stephen Kaufer","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is open.","Eric Sheridan","Thanks for taking the questions, maybe just two. One, Steve you mentioned with Priceline coming onboard did that allow you to accelerate your plans. Maybe just give us a little bit of color on what you'll see from Priceline that allows you to accelerate those plans? Is it the depth of inventory? Is it the brand name that Priceline Group makes the table the consumers will recognize more, and I wanted to understand a little bit more color about that? And then as you faced some of the headwinds as you push faster into IB how should we be thinking about the incremental leverage or deleverage in the business, you gave us a little bit of color around Q4, but how should we be thinking about that as you move through the transition? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. Excellent questions, Eric. We do think about those questions and sounds quite a bit of course. The reason Priceline enables us to accelerate our instant book rollout globally is because of the rich content that they have on 400,000 plus properties all around the globe, and by that I mean they are able to successfully take bookings on 400,000 plus properties in multiple, multiple, different language, processing payments for multiple different credit card by multiple different banks, all of those things because they are such a strong for mobile hotel reservation player, like Expedia, so I'm not saying that there is difference there. I'm simply saying, they already have the ability for someone that lives in France or in Japan. They come to their site to see the inventory that the traveler wants to stay in, see all the room descriptions in the local language, make the bookings using the local credit cards and we didn't have any of that for that customer in Japan for instance on TripAdvisor today. So if were to rollout TripAdvisor today, I would be showing an instant book experience in English to that Japanese traveler. I would be showing a room description for a Marriott property in English for that, for Marriott it might be a bad example because we might have Japanese content, but an independent hotel or brand, alright, we would be showing content in the wrong language to make a highly converting experience. Priceline gives us all of that oneself and it's highly strong [curetted] content, payments and breadth of inventory. That allows us to push faster in IB. We hope for an improved conversion rate. Travelers on our site going through that funnel because the experience is better. And so when we will know shortly enough whether or not that yields higher net revenue all the way to being accretive for us as we rollout instant book. I'm not sure of being plus or minus slightly accretive or slightly negative is going to influence the timing of the rollout for my earlier comments. We know this is the right thing to do for the traveler. We know this is the right thing to do for long-term direction of TripAdvisor. We're own stated. We're willing to take some short-term hits along the way, if it gets us toward where we want to be, and we have 18 months of history where we have improved our promotion quarter-after-quarter, quarter-after-quarter, so that we're confident, hey, we're always going be making progress and we may not always be as fast, we may not always be instantly, but we'll get there, and that's what gives us confidence to do a quick rollout even if it's not sort of instantly accretive. I hope that helped.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Sena from Evercore. Your line is open.","Ken Sena","Maybe if you can just go into that little bit more on the improved county methodology in terms of the hotel shopper growth. And it looks as early [IBs] also might have been restated and then? And then last quarter you had mentioned weakness in Europe, but didn't seem that you mentioned on this call, so were recoveries in there or was it soft just as attributed to other factors? Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. The counting on hotel shoppers, boy, if you can understand the challenge that us and every other West companies goes through to figure out who when visiting the site is the really user versus a robotic type. And we do kind of our best job and we're always looking at the algorithms. And from time to time, we find that there is something that we missed. And in this particular case, we revamped the algorithm to cut out some of the traffic that we didn't think at the end of the day was real. So we're always trying to present you the most active metrics that we have. We recast them to see the year-on-year over the past period, obviously, had no impact on revenue. Of course creeping out we're filtering out traffic that wasn't real. So it's a housekeeping footnote, because you'll see the stuff would change. I personally didn't pay any attention to it when I learned about it. In terms of the last quarter setting some weakness in Europe, I think we had a thesis that as the time based upon some of the evidence in front of us on sort of cross-border traffic and weakness in dollar, when we look at the macro issues in our past Q3, we're really pointing at instant book, we accelerate a rollout, right, long-term decisions, short-term, the smaller amount of pain that will certainly ruining the cake. And then we're looking at as we go forward, I mean, there is some pricing headwind that we see in our [stains and meta] business, and it's meta business, it's an auction, we don't set the price, our clients bid up, bid down, there is more consolidation in the global fit. There is ton of different trends not to mention currency going on and at the end of the day we believe our leads are just to qualify, so we think if there is a bit of a pricing hit, it's not something that we can influence. What we can influence and really what we're focused on is making IB as successful as it can be going forward. And that's why to double down, we're even more excited about the Priceline deal and it's our ability to roll it out even quicker.","Ken Sena","Thank you and just maybe a follow-up. On the hotel shopper growth in terms of the restatement, you did pull out some traffic. But is there anything we should infer from the slower shopper growth that you'd want to highlight?","Stephen Kaufer","I don't think so. As I said in more than a few calls, we're at a big scale issue now, so we touch an awful lot of travelers at some point. When I look at the business, I don't really look at dramatically improving hotel shoppers as much -- and those are measured on monthly unique. So I look more on how do we improve the revenue per shopper, how are we -- both closing the monetization gap as well as giving our shoppers more of what they are looking for. And I think will be a much stronger factor in our revenue growth in the coming months. Hotel shopper, we certainly expect to continue to grow, but at 16% or not terribly disappoint about that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Peck from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Robert Peck","Yeah, just two quick questions, please. First one is on the Priceline deal, the economics, I know you can't tell us the exact economics behind it, but directionally, can you give us a feel for if that's profitable to the Company and maybe the magnitude versus other deals on IB? And then Steve and Julie, we talked about 2015 EBITDA growth expectations. How should we think about 2016 for investors? Is there a range of growth we can be thinking about as we come out of this period of investment? Thanks so much.","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. I'll take the first one. On the economics of the Priceline deal, it was certainly a long time coming, we believe it's a really good deal for Priceline, it's really good deal for TripAdvisor, the economics or such that I am telling everyone, we're going full force rolling this thing out. We don't disclose the specifics, but you can judge by my actions of accelerating our rollout, that is something I think is going to work for the Company economically. And hey, Priceline is a really big company, they are not a short-term vision company either, so they are doing some things, well, you should ask them, but I would believe they are doing something that is in their best long-term interest as well.","Julie M.B. Bradley","I'll take the 2016, as this time of the year, we are always in a process of putting to data our plans and evaluating, messaging, and expectation setting for the following year. Ernst will be here next week and I will dilate into that exercise, and we are sure we'll be inviting you on the February call. We have given a couple of nuggets on 2016. One, we're pulling down, we're pausing TV, but we do expect to reinvest that into other channels. Q4, we're seeing it'd be a full year of instant booking headwinds which as the team is working actively to optimize and make that accretive. There would be expectation that that would continue into 2016. In addition to the monetization headwinds, there is a slight shift in a way revenue is recognized. So with the majority of our click-based revenue today, we recognize revenue on click immediately. As instant book become a more meaningful amount of revenue, we'll be experiencing a shift because when with instant book for the majority of our large partners including the Priceline Group, we will be recognizing revenue on stay. So there will be some seasonality and a shift in revenue as that becomes a more meaningful number. So that's something else to take into consideration and evaluating 2016. We're in the process of doing that ourselves. Looking at booking windows and consumer behavior, we'll an estimate into our 2016 plan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Jed Kelly","Great, thanks for taking my questions. As Priceline starts to rollout the instant booking participation, is there a difference on how it's going to participate? TripAdvisor in the U.S. versus internationally, will booking.com be more motivated in the U.S. and obviously more instant booking weighted internationally? And then can you just briefly touch on what marketing in channels have been driving the most efficiency?","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. Thanks for the question. So we'll know whether were any changes in the display or the participation in meta by Priceline Group, one fetch, once everything is actually rolled out, I'm not under any impression that being in instant book would change anyone's participation in meta whether we're on Priceline Group. They have always expressed to us as every client has. That's like as many transactions through our platform as possible. So I certainly would encourage you to ask the Priceline Group themselves, but my interpretation would be they are eager for all the traffic that they can get in better, just like they have. The normal years passed, they have been a phenomenal partner for us over many, many years. And they are excited about the new transactions we'll be delivering through the instant book path. So it's kind of additive, and I think that's how the discussions have always been based, that it's additive to their thinking of how to maximize their participation in the TripAdvisor channel. To the second part of the question, which marking channel is the most efficient, we tend to look for as many marketing channels as we can find that deliver sort of quality traffic. And for the most part we operate them on a breakeven basis. We view it as acquiring trial. And I'm talking about sort of ROI generating online channels, be it the search or targeting or CPM or any of the other methods of acquiring traffic. Other marketing channels that we'll be working on offline, for many of them it's nearly impossible to in that [product] measure. We do a quite bit amount of TR. We do fair amount of content licensing. We do a fair amount of engaging in various markets by leveraging our B2B or B2C community. None those have a direct ROI, but we spend few dollars in them and I think that's one of the reasons why if you are ever travelling, you're likely to see something branded TripAdvisor along the way and a TripAdvisor rated. And we level that, we don't even try to measure the marketing efficiency of those.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Merwin from Barclays. Your line is open.","Chris Merwin","Great thank you. I just had a couple of quick one. So in terms of the mechanics around instant book, my understanding is that currently your partners take a fixed commission, I guess kind of certain share of page, just based on that commission. Over time, can you talk about the potential for instant book to being involved into an auction process? Similar they have meta works today, and I know you can't talk about alliance in any deals of the terms but how long my debt shape to for an auction, that should be become reality? And then just secondly, I think maybe you want reasons why your partners get comfortable with instant book and correct me if me I'm wrong, because they get to see other brand and any ethical booking process I assume because they can let it start to repeat customer economics over time, obviously that booking is still being made through Trip, so what can you tell us so far about which part you might be occurring the benefit than it's repeat economics over time? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer","Certainly, so as part of the signup process for an independent hotel on the website, there is two commission rates, 12% and 15%, and here often the hotel sort of guarantee share of either 25% or 50% sort of share of their, we call it, eligible impression of the post visiting the page basically. It's part of our sort of sales pitch that if you signup, this is what we promise you, it will be a lot more of in that depending on a lot of different factors. And so going forward that independent who has signed up even at a 15% commission, TripAdvisor has, once the booking.com deal is live or even today with our current OTA partners, we make a choice at run time that that is beyond their share guarantee, do I wish to show and get a room as an OTA for that hotel or the hotel itself or [indiscernible] as an OTA for the hotel, so for any particular property, I might already have three or more participants in instant book. We make the decision based on who to show once the share guarantee has been met, we make the decision based upon what we think is going to be the best answer for the consumer that's usually going to be the best answer for TripAdvisor. What I mean is we have to evaluate how good the content is, the quality of the room description because the consumer wants to see that in order to hit the book button. We also care a lot about the price, and so whoever has a cheaper price is also going to have a higher conversion rate on our side, and then finally the commission does come into play. You can imagine an extreme of somebody offering to pay a ridiculous 20% commission for a property, while somebody else is offering to pay a 12%. If other things are equal then TripAdvisor is going to give the 20% commission, and that's kind of maximizes us and just no harm to the consumer because as I said all the other aspects of the flow were equivalent. With the current OTAs with Priceline -- with different brands that we have with Priceline Group, with eventually multiple brands from the Priceline Group, I think we'll have quite a choice as to who could fulfill the offer and we'll look at it from mostly with the best experience for the consumer. And secondarily, who has a good commission to us. You should interpret that as at the end of the day that combination is probably going to maximize TripAdvisor's revenue because I care the most about how many people are booking, and if I may go a little bit less commission per booking, but more people convert, we're going to make money, consumers are going to be happy, and that's the way we're looking forward.","To the second part of the question, sort of -- if I understand correctly who gets the benefit of the brand placement in the booking flow? From our perspective it's too early to tell. We just haven't been in the marketplace long enough on enough of our platforms in order to see who might get -- and I'm not even sure how carefully I could measure, but I'm not sure who is going to get that the second trip which tends not to happen the next day or even the next week. So we want to be very clear with all of our partners and certainly our travelers that is to get a room or that is to book enough term that is powering or Marriott that is powering this transaction. The other folks that we're going to go to when you want to make a change there would be -- owner of the property they can answer the question faster than we can or if the traveler has one. And if it's a second time booking for a similar property, we're certainly okay if that ends up being supplier direct. Our biggest opportunity is the traveler coming to our site enjoys the reviews, sees the room tips, looks at a dozen different candid photos, and says, yes, this is the property I'm looking for, I like the price maybe I go down the instant book flow, I'd select the type of room, but I'm not ready to book right now, and the next day or later in the week, when they are sure they want to take that trip, sure they want to stay in that property, they come back to TripAdvisor to finish the booking. And if we can close that leak, just that one piece of the leak, phenomenal huge rate on TripAdvisor even if the partner that powers the transaction, the Marriott or the Priceline wins the second booking because they have a great remarketing than we targeting to be campaign. Getting that first booking for us is -- I would say I want both but getting that first booking for us by changing the mindset of the traveler that's the biggest win, that we see over the next couple years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Tom White from Macquarie. Your line is open.","Thomas White","Great, thanks for taking my question. Maybe another one on the TV marketing pause? I guess I just want to make sure I can understand or sort of reconcile, Steve, your comments about the benefits of educating consumers about instant booking and the ability to book on the site. I guess, is what you're saying that just sort of the share presence of more instant booking visibility. Thanks to the Priceline deal and some of these other deals. That that's enough you think to educate consumers or I mean have you done studies or so what gives you confidence to throw that will be enough to kind of change travelers booking habits that have been probably pretty well entrenched sort of the way they book over the past 10 to 15 years? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer","So I wouldn't claim yet that I have an answer as to how we can quickly change consumers' mindsets. I look back and say, TripAdvisor hasn't really had an awareness issue in most of our markets. TV does a great job growing awareness, so we see how it worked for so many other companies, but the companies have tended to be at a different awareness stage, at different growth stage and so we went forward with TV knowing that it wasn't to move our awareness numbers, but to educate folks on that one could now book on TripAdvisor. We did the surveys on the TV and certainly the book message stood out, but it was harder to see the behavior change on TripAdvisor. We saw more traffic. We made more money, but it was softer to draw the conclusion that it got people to actually complete a transaction to book on TripAdvisor. So it would be in my mind no harm whatsoever and configuring a TV campaign that has the same message or I'd like to be creative but the same we're different creative, something wrong with that couldn't possibly hurt, but in the judgment call of is that where we want to push on our branding and marketing for next year, we made the judgment call, because we have to make this one in advance, so if there is no, we're going to pause. I used the word pause carefully because I'm not saying we wouldn't change our mind, we wouldn't do something else in 2017 or maybe the late 2016, but the notion is that's not -- it's a big dollar, it's not what we're going to spend those dollars on in '16. When we look at it from -- wow, you have a 100 plus million travelers on the site in a month, 150 million, 175 million, surely that's a big enough sample size to work on the educational message, and recently we've been doing quite a bit on that. So if you go to the site, many of our devices not all, you will see a much stronger, you can book on TripAdvisor, and buying with the experience of [indiscernible] buzzer button, hundreds of thousands of property is plus the global rollout, plus the message of other brand communications that are different\/cheaper than TV, you think that there is as I started with a judgment call, there something kind of wrong with the TV, but we think we can achieve our goals better in terms of training booked by spending our time and some of our dollars.","Thomas White","Okay. Thanks for the color. And I just wanted to say thank you to Julie and good luck on your next chapter.","Julie M.B. Bradley","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Heath Terry","Great, thank you. On the topic of the hotel shopper data restatement, is it fair to say, based on your comments Steve that this is largely a restatement around buy related traffic and not any sort of change to the way that you're [indiscernible] existing users? And then also if you could us a sense with the numbers changing sort of what the underlying numbers look like? What percentage of your traffic still is hotel shopper and how much did that change? Was the buyer traffic overly related to hotel shoppers versus everything else?","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. Yes, to the best of my knowledge, these restatements that I looked, out for hotel shoppers was entirely bought or fix user related. I do not believe it changed at all whether it was a hotel bought or a restaurant bought, they are all hitting us all the times. So I look at the percentage of visitors to TripAdvisor and I still put it at roughly half somewhere in the hotel half somewhere looking at hotels. It's a rough approximation. It is different by device, but I'm trying to give some color on the average and there was no change in any nothing else under the covers there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Douglas Anmuth from JP Morgan.","Bailey Wizbii","Hi this is Bailey in for Douglas. I'm going back to Priceline real fast, other than price what types of change and does it have Priceline on IB and what was the impact or reaction being then on the other hotel or OTAs that are considering.","Stephen Kaufer","So Priceline has been a great partner, we've been talking to them and every other OTA for quite some time to any instant book, many of them have Priceline and Expedia were the two noble ones that had decline and I think Priceline -- again feel free to ask them, but in ongoing discussions, each made some compromises and we found a common ground that allows them to get what they are looking for out of the relationship which is a branded experience and make sure customers know that Priceline is powering the booking. We are perfectly happy with that. They get growing transactions from our platform and we of course get the instant book rolling out globally. We get the improved content from our display and hopefully the improve conversion that comes with it. We can continue to show other OTAs and other suppliers in our store. You look forward to the remaining hotel brands joining in instant book. We look forward to having more instant book options across the board. We continue to signup independent hotels at a decent pace. We're building our own content management system as I mentioned to make sure those properties are represented on our site with excellent content and strong pricing. And it's like what we've done with meta. We're building out really strong marketplace globally for lots of different folks, hotels or the intermediaries to be able to power the bookings, so folks that choose to book on TripAdvisor. I take the opportunity to talk about instant booking and meta and I will always referred to it as bookings and meta. We love our instant book strategy. You heard me talk about it over and over, but I don't want anyone to think that meta is going away. Our messaging of plan compared and book plan that's the review of it. The content has the great decision support information that we have in order to help the consumer and find exactly where they want to go, where they want to stay, what they want to do to have the great trip, that's the plan message, the compare is, everyone is looking for the best price, showing A price on TripAdvisor and instant book is one of the options, and showing the price that is available elsewhere on the web from all the other players that the travelers web is part of that course into our message, and we expect to have that compare message for the forever future. It's just part of our core positioning, and plan, compare and book, and we want hit the price of instant booking to offer a great price, terrific content, the trusted brand of TripAdvisor as to why you should click and seeing the content and the brand provided by [what it was] actually doing, powering the booking for us the hotel itself for the high quality travel agent like Priceline or any of the other OTAs that are in store. It kind of completes that part of the purchase and then the rest of the TripAdvisor value proposition with which we're still very excited about, what we classify into our other businesses, few attractions and the restaurants and other ways that are going to make a trip incredibly powerful, but it's instant booking and meta has that core monetization vehicle for hotels. It's restaurants and attractions in other services on the trip, it's vacation rentals and alternative lodging in general that helps people well, when a hotel isn't quite what you're looking for. We have these other options. What are the urban inventories that we're sourcing through on a vacation rental, standard alternative lodging like the traditional vacation rental, those are all part of our store and it's our job to challenge our opportunity to present them at the right time to other travelers that are on our site. All in all, it's a pretty complete picture. It doesn't have everything, but when we look at the things that travelers are most interested, we would like to think the best offering in the plan space. We have a great offering in the compare space. We're learning how to have the best offering the book space. We don't have it yet, but we're getting that. And we have the best offering in the in destination market for attractions and restaurants globally. So it's a pretty good coverage of that lifecycle and I guess the question started with Priceline and so Priceline really helps us deliver on that book component.","Stephen Kaufer","Alright. With that I think we are stood out of time. So let me say, thank you very much. We are moving fast. We are making great progress on these long-term goals, and I understand really fortunate to have a great team on the job. So to all of our employees throughout the entire TripAdvisor family thank you again and again for your terrific work, for your hard work. It's showing results. I'm really proud and I look forward to updating everyone again on the next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Will Lyons, TripAdvisor's Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Will Lyons - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thanks, Latoya. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me today are Steve Kaufer, our CEO, and Julie Bradley, our CFO.","After the market closed today, we distributed our Q2 earnings release on our Investor Relations website, located at ir.tripadvisor.com. In the release, you will find reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures discussed on this call. Also, on our Investor Relations website, you'll find supplemental financial information, which includes certain non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that estimates and other forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view as of today, July 23, 2015. TripAdvisor disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. Please refer to today's earnings release and TripAdvisor's filings with the SEC for information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2014.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thank you, Will, and welcome, everyone. We accomplished a lot in the first half of the year. Our content and community grew quickly. We strengthened our platform. We deepened our relationship with some of the world's largest hotel chains. We continued to successfully position our brand and our products to delight more users throughout more phases of their travel planning and trip taking.","Our second quarter financial results were solid, despite significant year-over-year currency headwinds. Total revenue grew 25% to $405 million or 35% growth on constant currency. Click-based revenue grew 13% or 24% in constant currency.","On the bottom line, adjusted EBITDA decreased 5% to $123 million and would have been positive 15% growth in constant currency. We're navigating the near-term landscape with laser focus on executing on our two-year and three- to five-year growth initiatives.","Over the next two years, our top priorities are to expand our leading content in community and to help our travelers not only plan their trip, but to book it as well. We've made excellent progress on these goals during the second quarter. First, TripAdvisor continues to set the standard in rich user generated content and global community. Listings grew 23% to 5.2 million businesses. Users are adding content at a record rate of 160 contributions per minute and we reached more than 0.25 billion reviews and opinions, up 50% from last year. We're helping more users than ever before, as we had more than 1.8 billion unique visitors in the first half of 2015.","In Q2 alone, we averaged 375 million monthly unique visitors according to our internal logs, up 30% for the second straight quarter. Also, hotel shopper growth remained strong, growing 22%. We're doing a great job winning the increasingly mobile user as well. Nearly 50% of our traffic visits is on mobile devices and app downloads reached more than 215 million. Continuous mobile product innovation is key. In this quarter, we launched our TripAdvisor app for Apple Watch, Samsung Gear, and Pebble devices, bringing the power and convenience of TripAdvisor Content to wearables.","We also rolled out a new iPad app, a new travel guide to help more users when they are looking for where to eat and what to do on their trip. Further, this quarter we will cross the 100 million annual revenue run rate on phone, a great milestone for our mobile team and for our travel media business.","TripAdvisor remains unmatched as a place for users to plan a trip. Perhaps more importantly, these milestones speak to an even larger opportunity in front of us, to reduce friction, enable more users to plan, compare and book, places to stay, things to do, and places to eat on TripAdvisor. Though we're still very early days, we built great momentum thus far in 2015.","Specifically, in hotels, in Q2, we partnered with Marriott International and another top 10 global hotel chain for Instant Booking. These are our third and fourth major hotel announcements this year and we're now working with six out of the top 10 global hotel brands. Our Marriott partnership is a great example of what TripAdvisor can deliver as we bring Marriott an attractive global leisure audience and a great way to introduce more travelers to their 4200 properties across their 19 industry-leading brands.","Additionally, we added Mandarin Oriental, Langham Hospitality, and AmericInn during the quarter. And since the quarter ended, we further expanded our reach in APAC by partnering with Dorsett Hotels. We now have more than 60 chains hotel groups in OTA partners and have grown Instant Booking supplied to 235,000 properties or roughly a third of the e-commerce-enabled properties on our site.","This is amazing progress since our beta launch last year. We're also adding more independent hotels under the TripConnect platform through our Instant Booking beta. Hotelier feedback continues to be extremely positive and we look forward to working with many more independent hotels as our efforts there continue to ramp.","Building high quality hotel supply is a major step towards enabling more users to find the right hotel, pick the room and book on TripAdvisor with confidence. With our growing partner coverage, users will soon be able to book more than half of 5 million rooms offered by the top 10 hotel brands. We like where we are in the rollout, and we're excited to bring this feature to more users and more partners over the coming year.","Even before the feature is live on a more global scale, recent industry survey showed that TripAdvisor's influence in travelers is massive and expanding. Last quarter, I mentioned a comScore study that showed 40% of travel researchers who went on to make a travel purchase last summer visited TripAdvisor at least once. A recent PhoCusWright survey showed that more than 80% of respondents believe that by visiting TripAdvisor, they pick a higher quality hotel that's better suited for their needs. They feel more confident in their decision and perhaps, most importantly, they have a better trip.","On the marketing side, our plan, compare & book message is resonating in online and offline channels, especially through our TV ad campaign. The same PhoCusWright survey found that a greater percentage of respondents said they are visiting TripAdvisor at least a few times more per year in 2015 versus 2013, which we attribute to our growing value to consumers, as well as our increased TV presence.","Beyond hotels, the survey found that users are coming to TripAdvisor more frequently when planning where to eat and what to do on their trip. Our three- to five-year growth initiative is to further improve the user experience by helping more consumers around the globe find and book attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals and to reinforce our leadership position in these categories.","Perhaps, our biggest opportunity to do this is in attractions. Since opening up the Viator business to a marketplace model at the end of March, industry reception has been excellent. Tours and attraction operators see marketplace as a great way to showcase their products in front of the world's largest travel audience. In fact, Viator added nearly double the number of new products in Q2 as compared to all of 2014. Even before the marketplace rollout, transaction growth has been accelerating as Viator leverages TripAdvisor's consumer marketing strength and global reach.","In restaurants, we're executing aggressively on our organic and inorganic growth strategy. In a little more than 12 months, we have extended our restaurant business into 12 countries. This quarter, we launched the Fork in Portugal and we also entered Australia by acquiring the talented team from Dimmi. The restaurant network has grown at an amazing rate and we're seating diners at more than 28,000 restaurants. Also, our restaurant products are perfectly suited for users on the go and nearly half of the Fork's booking are made via mobile.","In vacation rentals, our ongoing shift to a transaction-based model continues to progress nicely. Users can choose from more than 720,000 properties and we continue to focus on adding more high quality inventory. We're also in the process of refreshing our owner center, creating a simpler, more engaging and unified experience.","The financial benefits continue to shape up nicely as transaction revenue accounted for more than 50% of our Q2 vacation rentals revenue. We like where we are in our shift to the transaction model as it is beneficial for travelers and homeowners alike.","At greater scale, these businesses can drive stickiness to our platform, making TripAdvisor an even more indispensable travel companion. They are long-term plays and we are investing to capture significant opportunity over the next three to five years. Near term, our priorities are simple: move fast, scale quickly, drive a better user experience and focus on revenue growth and market share gains.","In summary, we're pleased with our recent traction and how we're successfully positioned in the business for the long-term.","And now, here's Julie.","Julie M.B. Bradley - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We continue to see strong growth amidst a soft currency environment. Second quarter total revenue grew 25%, decelerating 4 points sequentially off of a 9-point tougher comp, driven by our click-based business and our hotel segment, as well as our other segment. Note that in constant currency, total revenue growth would have been 35%, up from the 29% constant currency growth in the second quarter last year.","Consolidated Q2 adjusted EBITDA decreased 5% to $123 million, behind our expectations for flattish growth, and would have been positive 15% on a constant currency basis.","Foreign exchange headwinds have continued to be a persistent challenge since Q4 last year. While our top-of-funnel hotel shopper metrics remained strong, the U.S. dollar strengthened for the third straight quarter. This prolonged soft currency environment has led to weaker pricing outside of our strong U.S. and UK markets, which may be impacting international consumers overseas buying power.","As Steve noted, we're very pleased with our strong traffic growth and we're navigating the soft currency landscape with caution, as we are more focused on strengthening our business for the long term.","Q2 click-based revenue grew 13% or 24% in constant currency, driven by 22% hotel shopper growth. This growth decelerated sequentially 7 points on a 12-point tougher comp. Revenue per hotel shopper growth was negative 6% for the quarter. Similar to Q1 absent currency translation headwinds, Q2 revenue per hotel shopper would have been slightly positive.","Display-based revenue grew 8% against a tough year-over-year comp, driven primarily by foreign exchange headwinds slightly impacting currency translation and more significantly impacting our partner ad budget. Our display team continues to deliver great value to our clients leveraging our unique scale and robust data manager platform to deliver unique insights, offer breadth of products and enhance targeting capabilities. These attributes improve campaign performance that rivals all competitors.","Subscription, transaction and other revenue growth accelerated 94% for the quarter, driven by contributions from prior-year attraction and restaurant acquisitions, as well as by continued traction from our ongoing shift to a transaction-based vacation rentals business. Note that we lap our Viator acquisition in Q3, at which point we expect growth to normalize.","From a segment perspective, our core hotel segment posted 13% revenue growth, or 22% in constant currency, with 36% adjusted EBITDA margin. During Q2, we invested roughly $20 million in television advertising to amplify our plan, compare, and book consumer message. We are seeing very positive results from this new campaign and it is part of our two-year initiative to educate more consumers to come to TripAdvisor to plan, compare and book. This investment steps up again in Q3 before stepping back down in Q4 due to travel seasonality.","Other segment revenue grew 210% in Q2, primarily driven by attraction and restaurant acquisitions and partially offset by currency translation headwinds and lower average order value for international travelers. Other segment adjusted EBITDA margins were negative 3% for the quarter, as we invest in growth and market share gains as well as from high-revenue seasonality in attractions and vacation rentals.","Moving to head count. We ended Q2 with just over 3,000 employees, up 43%, driven primarily by prior-year attraction and restaurant acquisitions. As far as taxes, our Q2 GAAP effective tax rate of 29% increased primarily due to changes in full-year forecasted geographical mix. We continue to expect our GAAP effective tax rate for the full year to be in line with our projected 2015 GAAP tax rate of 27% to 28%.","We ended Q2 with 146 million fully diluted shares outstanding, and we estimate that our diluted share count would increase by less than 2% by the end of 2015, subject to our stock price movement, potential share buybacks and new share issuances.","We generated $200 million of cash from operations during the second quarter, or 49% of revenue. CapEx for the quarter was $23 million or 6% of revenue, driven by leasehold improvements for our new headquarters, capitalized website development and data center expansion to support our traffic growth. This amounted to $177 million of free cash flow in Q2 or 44% of revenue.","CapEx should decrease significantly as a percentage of revenue in the back half of the year, as we have now taken occupancy of our new corporate headquarters. As such, we continue to expect 2015 capital expenditures to be roughly 5% of revenue.","In terms of liquidity, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities increased $104 million during the quarter to $746 million, driven primarily by free cash flow. We also had just over $100 million remaining under our existing share repurchase plan.","We were pleased to complete a new $1 billion credit facility this past quarter and drew down on it to retire the outstanding balance of our term loan at a 25 basis point annual savings at our current leverage ratio. Our strong financial position enabled us to continue to be opportunistic on the organic and inorganic investment front as we pursue long-term growth.","Finally, as it relates to guidance, based upon our view into international CPC pricing today, we are tempering our near-term outlook. We now expect 2015 total revenue growth to be in the low to mid-20%s, and EBITDA growth in the low to mid single digits. Our guidance reflects recent business trends and foreign exchange rates as of today, and does not assume future positive or negative FX movements. As such, future changes in FX and the related effects on users and partners could positively or negatively impact our outlook.","While we're incrementally cautious about the near-term, I want to echo Steve's comments that we're navigating these choppy currency waters and remain laser focused on what we can control; namely, building great products, improving the user experience, and making the necessary investments to make our global platforms more valuable over the long term. Our business grew stronger in the second quarter, and we're excited about where we're headed.","We will now open the call up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And the first question is from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. A high level question for Steve. You talked about vacation rentals transitioning over to more of a transactions model and I know this is this kind of a long-term trend. Overall, do you think that's what you would like to do with the business over the next three to five years, turn it much more into a transactions model, transactions business across all verticals?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Across all verticals outside of vacation rentals you mean, or...?","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes. I do mean that. Yes.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","So, we believe in the notion of plan, compare and book. We know that there is a set of our customers that genuinely want to book on TripAdvisor. It's more convenient. It's easy on the phone. There's kind of lots of reasons why that's a desirable end state. But that compare piece is really quite important to our consumers. And so, where a traveler has a preference for a particular supplier, has a preference for a particular OTA, has a preference for a particular booking channel, be it the phone, as in dialing a telephone number, all of that's fine with us. We want to offer that as features, offer that as capabilities so that the meta business that we currently have, we don't expect is ever going away. In fact, offering that price comparison in the hotel space is key. So we expect the hotel space to migrate towards transaction, but where I see vacation rentals being in the future, I would expect it to be almost all transaction oriented. I think hotels will remain split for the foreseeable future.","In terms of restaurants, not really \u2013 it's all transaction in terms of \u2013 well, the restaurants, it's media for restaurants that we don't take reservations on and then obviously transaction on the reservation. And then attraction, there really isn't a marketplace that people are price shopping on. The prices are generally set. So, again, media for the attractions that aren't bookable and we would expect it to move to transactions for ones that are bookable.","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you, Steve.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Certainly. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. So when you guys look at how people use the site, Steve, and the kind of concentration of ad clicks or page views, is there an 80\/20 rule where 80% of user page views are perhaps on 20% of hotels such that you really only need to get Instant Book relationships with 20% of the hotels on your site to get effective coverage up to the vast majority of kind of hotel page views for Instant Book? And kind of as a follow-up, you mentioned working with 6 of the top 10 and we've seen Hyatt on the site powering Instant Book. Is that someone you can confirm you're working with? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Certainly. So, to tackle the first question, Instant Book, and we need all million properties. Absolutely, there's an 80\/20 rule, and it's kind of always been that case. The beauty of having a meta model going to a transaction model or adding a transaction model means that we have a wonderful way currently, we always have, to monetize all of the hotels that have \u2013 that are e-commerce enabled which is a huge percentage and certainly the vast, vast, vast majority of all the page views.","So to offer my value proposition to the consumer, hey find and compare prices, I got it. Don't need to change anything. So I get to layer on Instant Booking as the transactional model where we have connectivity, where it works pricing-wise without sort of \u2013 compare to being TripAdvisor as an online travel agency just starting up, only having a limited set of inventory. We're not in that case. We have all the inventory.","So to the point of establishing direct connectivity with major hotel chains and independents, absolutely I get to focus our sales effort on the 20% or 30% or 15% that matter the most. We've opened up the platform, so that anybody who is connected can sign up because we really never discriminate or preference against the small hotel in the middle of nowhere if they are connected with an Internet booking engine to us today. Awesome, they get to sign up today, and we'll send them bookings relating to the traffic we have, but the shorter answer to your great question was yes, there's an 80\/20 rule that helps us go after the right supply.","To the second half of the question, yes, you saw Hyatt as an Instant Book partner, and yes, I can confirm that Hyatt is that additional hotel brand that I mentioned in my comments and we're very excited to be bringing them live as we speak.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Congrats on that. Just as a follow-up, we get a lot of questions from investors about the monetization impact and is the near-term hit of kind of learning to convert, is that a detriment versus metasearch economics? And you've said in the past, sometimes it's better, sometimes it's worse. Is it safe to say that in a direct hotel relationship as opposed to like via some of the smaller OTAs the conversion lift is better enough such that it's not \u2013 it's revenue-accretive to plug in a new chain or a new independent hotel?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Great question. I wish I could be definitive in the answer. It actually does \u2013 there are a lot of factors at play. So when you have a relationship with a chain, it tends to be at a more global commission rate, and some of those properties might list themselves on an OTA at a rate that the individual property sort of tops up. That can make the CPC that a OTA player will pay us more valuable to us than the direct commission we get from the chain. When the individual property doesn't do that then the propensity of consumers, some consumers to choose a supplier direct partner, plus the very reasonable commissions that we're getting from our clients, yes, it works out.","I started my answer by saying it's not quite as simple as that because even within chains we have \u2013 and certainly with independents we have different levels of content. And by that, I mean, room descriptions, rate plans, and I need to caveat the answer by saying, all other things being equal. The room descriptions being just as good on an OTA site as in our Instant Book, and the pricing being just as good and certainly the availability.","So, we look at the equation and say, the limiting factor on us rolling out Instant Book, tends to be around, are we giving the consumer a great experience which in turn is related to, do we have good room descriptions, do we have good rates, is the connectivity really working in all the cases, and how many intermediaries are there in the connectivity namely, supplier direct relationship being the fewest intermediaries in terms of us being able to match the equivalent meta CPCs.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is open.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Julie, you made the comments around TV ad spending picking up in Q3 and then coming back down in Q4. But just broadly about what you've seen from that advertising spending, we'd love to get a better sense of what the team has seen in terms of brand lift, driving traffic, and maybe even changing user perceptions about what they can do on TripAdvisor including sort of adopting the Instant Booking product? Thanks.","Julie M.B. Bradley - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. So we are definitely \u2013 we have increased our spend in 2015, essentially doubling it from $30 million to $60 million this year. We are very excited about our new creative. I hope you've seen it. But it really seems to be resonating well with the consumer, the plan, compare and book. We're using a survey method to determine the reason why consumers are coming to our site and it's definitely reflecting positively on the TV channel. So we're ramping up again in Q3 as this is the largest travel season and then we will significantly decrease that in Q4 as travel is seasonally lower.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And this is Steve. I'd probably add that the message is all around \u2013 in the TV campaigns is around using TripAdvisor as a booking site which we found consumers do not always equate with a site to put your credit card in. Many consumers will refer to our old meta engine or other meta sites as places they go to book in part because those aren't places \u2013 the other sites aren't sites that they go to read reviews.","And so our challenge all along has been we have so many travelers coming to read reviews, getting them to come back when they're ready to compare book and whether or not Instant Book is rolled out, in a lot of consumers' mind, we already have that functionality. We need to drive it home that \u2013 again, it's not TripAdvisor is a review site, while we're certainly extremely proud of our heritage there, it's wonderfully up funnel, (29:29) we're the plan, compare and book site. And the TV does seem to be doing that for us, as well as our on-site marketing and the messaging we're driving home to our customers.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co","Hey. Good afternoon. I've gotten a few questions just in the last few minutes from people here regarding the guidance. Can you talk about just maybe more of the specifics around tweaking the full-year guidance? It sounds like it's specifically related to international CPCs. Is that correct? Is there anything more you can say on that front as far as what the moving parts are, and is there anything macro-related or competitive-related or how would you kind of characterize that?","Julie M.B. Bradley - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. Thanks for your question. There was some FX translation and incremental headwinds that we saw this past quarter, but only about 100 basis points to 200 basis points since our Q1 call. The real impact was around international pricing. So I think the best way to look at that is through our supplemental metrics that we posted on our IR website.","You'll see there that revenue growth by geography really highlights this trend. When you look at the different geographies year-over-year contribution, North America represented 61% of the growth this past quarter versus 36% in Q2 of 2014. Whereas when you look at EMEA, they contributed only 24% of the growth last quarter compared to 45% last year and APAC was 7% of the growth this past quarter versus 16% of last year.","And it's even larger when you look at it sequentially. North America growth accelerated while international regions decelerated. So we think the soft currency landscape has had some modest benefit for travelers from the stronger markets like our U.S. and UK market, as they've been able to increase their buying power. But the opposite is true for travelers outside the U.S. and UK for whom overseas travel has gotten a lot more expensive.","So we believe this may explain why we continue to see strong demand around the globe, up in traffic. Overall traffic, in fact, globally were strong, but in Europe and Asia, we're not seeing the revenue growth due to pricing. So, we're trying to be cautious and not assuming that any of these trends are going to change over the balance of the year. And that's why we felt it was prudent to lower our guidance expectations to what we're seeing today, both from a pricing standpoint and a translation standpoint.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co","All right. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Brian Fitzgerald of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Steve, I think you said 130 of your properties are now on Instant Book and you gave some nice color around gating factors as you answered Lloyd's question. So thank you there. Do you see that penetration rate generally accelerating as you remove or overcome some of those gating factors? Are you finding it increasingly easier or faster to do the integrations and to deliver that high quality consumer experience that you're targeting?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure, Brian. Thanks for the question. In terms of overall coverage, at least where IB is rolled out now, it's pretty good. You get a good sort of \u2013 you see Instant Book in most of the places that you'd want. So, the 235,000 properties is \u2013 it's not covering all. We have a lot more than that. We want it to be better, all the rest, but that's still a pretty good number. The opportunity for us is really building a more direct supply relationship with those properties, as it's currently rolled out, then we have a whole another set of challenges on the international rollout in terms of language of room descriptions and all the rest.","So when we look at the ingredients to make the current rollout of IB even better, it is better rates and availability. It is getting the best \u2013 again, we call it, the room descriptions, the content on each of the pages to be as good as it can be. And yeah, we're pretty proud of the progress that we've made in the first half of this year.","The longer tail of independents, hey, they're signing up now. We're working with them and that is a much longer process, because there's a lot of Internet booking engines as kind of the middlemen there and we have to make sure the content works. We have to make sure that the pricing always works. And we've been at it for a while. They continue to grow. And if you look around on the site, it won't take you long to find quite a few independent hotels, and when we get those and the rate and content is good, the conversion rate is something that we're pleased with.","Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks, Steve.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Jed Kelly of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks for taking my question. FX-neutral CPC pricing continues to increase despite a tougher comp. Is it more pricing improving from \u2013 in mobile from Instant Booking or is it more competitive auction dynamics in desktop. I mean, I realize that U.S. accelerated nicely, so does that have something to do with it?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","I'm not sure I'm following the question. Could you try it again for me?","Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","It seems that CPC increased like \u2013 FX neutral CPC increased, it's trending despite a tougher comp. Is there anything around that? Is mobile pricing improving from Instant Booking or is it more competitive auction dynamics?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","So, when we look at some of our revenue growth, it is coming from U.S., UK markets, those tend to be \u2013 are some of our stronger CPC markets. So you're probably seeing something in there. Yeah, I'd say the auction is heating up. I don't want to misstate anything, so I'm trying to remember back in Q2. But you can take it as our mobile pricing over the course of the first half of the year has gotten stronger. We're seeing the nice trends there.","I'm not sure it's anything frankly that we're doing on that subject versus consumers are getting more used to booking on their phone and therefore our downstream conversion rate is doing better and therefore our clients are naturally able to pay more for the lead. So we're riding that trend which helps us obviously a lot as a lot of our traffic is already on the phone and we know we lose a lot of attribution as that phone traffic makes it over and actually consummates the transaction on the desktop, i.e., the less that happens, the more credit we actually get, the more deserved credit that we get for the booking on the phone.","In terms of the auction heating up, there hasn't been any big new players come into the auction in the last quarter. And they're bidding in various markets on various properties. We see the results, but the rationale behind it is always quite opaque to us.","Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Naved Khan of Cantor. Your line is open.","Naved A. Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Yeah. Thanks. So, of the fixed chain \u2013 hotel chain partners that you have signed on, can you talk a little bit about if they are taking sort of a more gradual approach in terms of opening up their inventory or are they \u2013 how are they managing the TripAdvisor channel?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Hi, Naved. Our approach and I think the approach taken by \u2013 I think I can say, all of the chains is great. When they make the commitment to do Instant Booking, we negotiate a commission and then they want it all up there. And the reason you might only see a few Hyatt properties at the moment versus their entire set, has to do with a rollout strategy dictated on the technical ends of both companies that says, hey, we want it to work. We want to make sure the bookings go through. We're testing on these properties. On the phone first is what we did and then the desktop, and then we roll it out to more properties and more geographies. So, that's purely an execution issue. I can't think of any chain I've spoken with that once they've come in, haven't wanted to be everything, everywhere.","Naved A. Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. That's helpful. And then, on the \u2013 can you talk a little bit about how the pipeline looks for Instant Book in terms of adding on more partners?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah. So we're certainly in discussions with every partner you can imagine. I presume we're talking chains and hotel groups. I don't want to set expectations that we'll get all of the rest of the 10 in the next quarter, because some of these folks move faster than others. Obviously, Best Western, Choice moved very quickly. They're in a different luxury class. Marriott was a big win for us. They cover a lot of different types of hotels and are viewed by many as a leader in the space. So that certainly helped propel a number of discussions. But I remind folks that we don't need 10 out of the top 10 or 20 out of the top 20 to be wonderfully successful with Instant Book.","Unlike in OTA, if hotel brand A is not directly connected with us in Instant Book, I still have all of their properties through an OTA, through our own Tingo or Getaroom or many of our other OTA partners. So, we still have the ability to do an Instant Booking with those folks. The margin may not be as good to us when we go through the intermediary, but we can still offer that service or we choose not to enable Instant Book on that property and our consumer still has the full meta experience.","So our ability to roll that out gradual certainly has helped us over time because we were able to roll out Instant Book with only a couple of suppliers. It helps our economics to get more suppliers on board. That's great. But we're not \u2013 there's no requirement and I don't want to set expectations that once we get 10 out of 10, we would roll out Instant Booking everywhere. It's not at all how I think about the equation.","Naved A. Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Got it. And then one last question, if I may, for Julie. Just going back to the guidance, and I think you went into explaining how \u2013 what are the thing \u2013 what are the ins and outs. But just sort of a quick clarification \u2013 and I think you talked about how sort of reduced buying power of some currencies is affecting growth in some of the geographies. But is that just \u2013 does it mean people are actually not really booking as much or looking to travel as much, or is it that they just sort of taking more local vacations and things of that sort?","Julie M.B. Bradley - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah, sure. So, let me just start with what \u2013 we do have full visibility to is that up on the attraction side where we have seen \u2013 because we see the full transaction compared to hotels where we don't necessarily know the downstream conversions. But we had seen with attractions that three quarters of strengthening dollar has negatively impacted the average order value. So if the Europeans, for example, are going to take a trip, they might pick the walking tour versus the helicopter ride. So they're being a little bit more price-sensitive.","What we've seen on the hotel side is a decline in pricing. And we've also been able to determine from where our consumers are coming from and the hotels that they are looking at that they do seem to stay intra-Europe. So I'm not going as far away and maybe on shorter stays. So we think the combination of what's going on in the currency has and \u2013 just the overall climate is negatively impacting the consumers.","Naved A. Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Got it. So in a nutshell, it's really sort of the attractions business sort of taking some head and then obviously people making a choice to travel locally versus international?","Julie M.B. Bradley - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah, I think that's right. We can clearly see it on the attractions side that they're making different choices. And we can interpret that the same thing is happening on the hotel side. So I think we have two things at play, we have increased FX translation headwinds. And then this potential impacts on the consumers and their choices that they are making.","Naved A. Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Great. Thanks a lot.","Julie M.B. Bradley - TripAdvisor, Inc.","No problem.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Chris Merwin of Barclays. Your line is open.","Chris Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you. So at this point is Instant Book rolled out to the majority of domestic desktop users and how should we think about the timeline of the international roll out? And then, just secondly the subscription transaction and other segment continues to grow as a percentage of your total revenues. So would you be able to just to give us some sense of the relative growth and profitability of the three main businesses in that segment? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. So, in \u2013 I believe it was in Q2 we had increased our roll out of IB on desktop. We don't disclose specific percentages, but if you bounce around, you'll see it quite often. It is fully rolled out. There might be a couple of percentage holdback on the phone, and all of that is for U.S. traffic. We don't have set and we wouldn't disclose if we did the specific timeframe for rolling it out on international. There's a sort of big chunk of work to do to get that kind of first country \u2013 the first non-English country out because, as I say, the whole booking flow has to be tailored to a specific language and that's a lot of content that has to change.","To your second question, decomposing the profitability of our other segment business, I'm sorry, but that's just not something that we go into.","Julie M.B. Bradley - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah. And just, I would add that in this quarter, we are lapping the acquisition of La Fourchette, past quarter. And in Q3, roll out the acquisition of Viator. So, in Q4, you're going to start to see the kind of normalized growth rates from a year-over-year perspective.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","One of the things we do in that other segment is we had tried to help folks get a view into the amount that we're investing in the non-hotel business. And we don't break it out in detail, but you can see that we're not trying to maximize profit there. We are looking to grow. We think the opportunity over the next several years and attractions is huge. In restaurants, it's huge. In vacation rentals, huge. There's existence proofs for two out of those three. And in China, which is our other huge opportunity, we still put into the hotel category. And so, hey, we have indicated we operate China at a loss and that's still tucked into the other piece even though it's an investment vehicle for us.","Chris Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Anthony DiClemente of Nomura. Your line is open.","Kevin Rippey - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi, guys. This is Kevin for Anthony. Just a quick question on Instant Booking. When a large hotel operator moves to Instant Book, how does that impact their click-based spend, is it binary, all or nothing of spend, or is it more of a trend like gradual transition?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thanks, Kevin. Interesting question. To my knowledge, I don't think when an Instant Book client goes live, I don't think it affects their CPC spend at all. I don't think they look at it that way, frankly. So I'm not surprised by that as a result. The hotel chain or the independent looks at TripAdvisor and says there is a lot of traffic in there, awesome. How can I maximize the traffic I get through all available means?","And for a chain, one answer is, I'm going to buy a business listing because some percent of the folks really want to click on the link and come over direct to my website to explore more. Some want to call the phone number. That's part of what the business listing offers, subscription fee. Another folk say, hey, they don't want to try that book on TripAdvisor thing. They just want to click on the meta link like I'd been doing for the past umpteen years. So they keep that buy there. And then, the ones that are connected get to go for the Instant Booking. So we talk to the hotels. And I think they look at it as sort of three bites at the traveler and they are able to maximize the number of bookings they're getting in their mind directly from TripAdvisor, and that's a good thing. I don't \u2013 and I think if you put yourself in the shoes of a hotelier, that makes sense, because they're measuring each of these channels independently and they're all profitable for them. So why not go for as much as you can get?","Kevin Rippey - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Heath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. Steve, Julie, wondering if you can help a little bit more on this guidance question, because I understand that you're guys are focusing on international CPC. But in the most recent data that we've seen, ADRs internationally have actually been particularly strong, some of the strongest that we've seen in years.","Is that simply a function of this being backward-looking and you're seeing something changed materially from June in terms of the strength of pricing, or is there something else beyond ADRs that are impacting that, particularly if it's monetization, a difference in monetization on the Instant Book side?","Julie M.B. Bradley - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. Hi, Heath. Thanks for the question. First, we're looking at that data as well, the reports that are coming out. One thing that I would call out to you is that the June data is not out yet. So we're able to take advantage of seeing the first 23 days of July and all of June to come to our conclusion on how we forecast pricing trends for the balance of the year.","And the other piece of it what I had mentioned before and more specifically of what we've seen as of late in attractions because we do get to see the complete funnel with attractions is there's clearly a change in consumer behavior where they're booking lower value towards their attractions, and then, in our own traffic log files, we're able to see that the European consumer, in particular, they're still traveling, but they are traveling intra-Europe or having shorter stays.","I think part of the ADR question as well is the U.S. is traveling and the stronger currencies are taking advantage of the lower currency areas. But the rest of world, by our numbers, from both the revenue that we saw in Q2 and the data trends into July, make us cautious for the balance of the year.","Heath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks, Julie.","Julie M.B. Bradley - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Kevin Kopelman of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Kevin C. Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks a lot. Can you give us any color on your own marketing budget looking into the second half? You've really been growing it nicely even excluding television and the acquisitions. Thanks.","Julie M.B. Bradley - TripAdvisor, Inc.","All right. Sure too. I'll just take some of the \u2013 it is up year-over-year and also sequentially. A big part of that is the timing of our TV spend that was not in line with \u2013 and a doubling of it from prior year. I will also add that looking at the year-over-year basis, if you exclude the increase of TV and also normalize that we did not own Viator in the second quarter, it remains relatively constant as a percentage of revenue. So that's the math. I think our focus is that we believe in these investments that we are making for the long term, and that they're really important for the overall growth of the business. So we are holding pat on our investment strategy.","Kevin C. Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Nat Schindler of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Nat H. Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, hi, guys. Julie, just a clarification. Hotel revenue is click-based plus display, plus business listings, correct?","Julie M.B. Bradley - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah, that's the majority of it. I'd actually flip it the other way. If you look at all the businesses that we're in, everything except for vacation rentals, restaurants and attractions, is included in hotel. And those three businesses are included in other.","Nat H. Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Then if I look at the subscription and other line that would imply with $62 million coming from vacation rentals, La Fourchette, Viator and the other things, then business listings would have been down sequentially for the first time. Is this just currency?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","I think \u2013 this is Steve. I think currency plays a role, I think we have a great product that is still underpenetrated in the market. We have a lot of different opportunities by way of pricing, by way of new vehicles in which to push the product out. We have quite a few plans going forward to \u2013 how do I phrase it \u2013 to deepen our relationship with the individual hotelier, that's not just based around Instant Book, but all the different ways that they can take advantage of our TripAdvisor traffic. So the growth wasn't quite what we had expected in our subscription biz this particular quarter, but I'd view it more as just a bump along the road or something that is part of our overall plans for the biz.","Julie M.B. Bradley - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah. And, Nat, just on the math, business listings did grow year-over-year and did grow sequentially. So there's other businesses, as I mentioned, that are in there. But business listing grew year-over-year and Q-over-Q.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah. My answer was the growth had slowed.","Julie M.B. Bradley - TripAdvisor, Inc.","It had slowed, but it's still growing.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And I view the opportunity as to \u2013 I won't say accelerate it necessarily, but continue on a robust growth path for quite some time.","Nat H. Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Rodney Hull of SunTrust. Your line is open.","Rodney A. Hull - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. Hey. Great. Thanks for taking my question and I apologize if some of this was covered earlier. But I just wanted to touch on when a brand converts to IB, is there any transition in terms of the data that gets shared between when it does a CPC booking and it goes to its own site versus doing an Instant Booking on TripAdvisor?","And then separately, when you guys do convert brands and there's sort of more of a branding effort now as you experiment with the ways that the Instant Booking profiles sort of gets listed on the page. Have you seen any lift that you can talk to in terms of when, say, Marriott is included in that button versus just the generic button in terms of getting conversion done? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah. So, the second part of the question first. We don't have Marriott live on the site yet, so I can't give you the answer that I am dying to figure out. So, we have been playing around with the brands that we have. And as we've known all along, there is \u2013 enough consumers have a preference for seeing the supplier-direct brand compared to the lesser-known OTA brand like a Tingo in the booking pass.","So, we continue to be excited about presenting that in a better way. We understand that most of the brands want to see their brand played up higher on TripAdvisor, and we're in sort of complete agreement with that to help the consumer kind of get what they're looking for. And I'm sorry. The first part of your question was...?","Rodney A. Hull - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","The first part was related to sort of the data share that comes within Instant Booking. Is it any different than what they would have received otherwise? Are you not sharing any data with them? Just want to better understand that relationship there in terms of what the hotel can do with that booking.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","The hotel in both cases, the hotel gets all the same information. They're getting the consumer name, what the hotel is, the booking rates, everything, the email. They get it all. It actually, in other words, everything we collect in the booking pass, when for Instant Booking we are sending off to the hotel. It's actually we get more information during Instant Book than when we send off a meta click, because when someone does an Instant Booking, now I know who they are. I have a new member with an email address if they weren't already a member. Whereas with a click, an awful lot of our clicks in the meta model, they are not already members, they click off and really all I know about them is that this IP address or this computer looked at this hotel and I have no way to message them.","Particularly nice on the phone and on the desktop and as we build up our brand as a place to come back to book, well now I'm building up a customer base that is used to booking on TripAdvisor. And when we look at on the phone where we've been out for a bit longer, not surprising, we're seeing more and more repeat bookings coming from users that not only did they book once in Instant Book on the phone, they booked a second time and a third time. And of course that's what you would see with any e-commerce site and we're seeing it as well.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Steve Kaufer for closing remarks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. And I really want to say thank you to all the employees throughout all the entire TripAdvisor, Inc. family of companies. Your continued hard work to help build a bigger and better business is much appreciated. And to everyone, I look forward to updating you all on our next quarter.

We are reinventing how users book and have awesome trips. Think about how it's been for the past five to 10 years. You've gone online, you've likely searched on TripAdvisor, you've looked on search engines, you've searched destination sites, you've traveled on booking sites, you've checked supplier sites. At the end of it all, you've searched at least 15 to 20 different sites to try to figure out where do you want to go, where you're going to have a great time, where you're going to stay, how are you going to book it and then you've got to go do the whole search all over again to go find the best price and feel safe about where you're booking.","At TripAdvisor we have sought to solve these inefficiencies in that travel booking journey. Recently, we've done this in three ways.","First, we've widened our content mode, reinforcing our leadership position is the most trusted brand in travel research. Since 2011, network effects have intensified as user content has accelerated from 30 contributions per minute to more than 200 per minute. In 2015 alone, users added 82 million contributions on TripAdvisor, and we now offer users 320 million reviews and opinions on 6.2 million businesses around the globe.","Second, in 2013, anticipating change in consumer preferences, we added Hotel Metasearch enabling users to find all the best prices for more than 200 different booking engines across the web.","And third, over the past couple of years, again anticipating consumers growing desire to transact in a one-stop shopping fashion on mobile devices, we started to add bookability to our offering. So, now imagine this, rather than visiting those 15 to 20 sites again and again to make sure that you\u2019re finding the best hotel, getting the best price and booking with the brand new trust, consider this more efficient booking journey. A user goes to TripAdvisor for the trusted review content to find out where to go, you have all the information you need to plan that prefect trip. And when they\u2019re shopping for a hotel, they stay on TripAdvisor because we have all the best prices and information regarding availability around the web, and when they\u2019re comparing prices on TripAdvisor, they see that Book on TripAdvisor button, which has room prices that are at least as good or better than the Metasearch options. They connect the TripAdvisor's, the brand I trust with TripAdvisor's to where I find the lowest price with TripAdvisor's, where I can find and book the lowest price. So they click, they book, they\u2019re done right then and there.","This improve the hotel shopping experience isn't just a hypothetical future, it\u2019s here today. With the improved travel booking journey TripAdvisor is delivering to more and more users and more and more markets today. In 2015, we took some major steps in establishing instant booking as a strong platform. As you may know, we\u2019ve partnered with eight of the 10 largest hotel chains. In October, we announced an instant booking partnership with The Priceline Group, the largest OTA in the world. As a result, users are able to book 450,000 hotels worldwide on TripAdvisor. Following our full instant book launched to U.S. and UK users in September, we launched the All English Language countries this January.","Instant booking is diluting our near-term financial results, but we see good leading indicators of success. Conversion rates are comparable to Metasearch. Users are coming back to TripAdvisor more frequently and where pre-booking rates are up, all suggesting that more users are coming to know TripAdvisor as a great place to book.","As a result, we\u2019re moving quickly with instant booking. In February, we rolled out to the rest of our major European markets. In March, our plan is to roll out additional countries in Asia Pacific and LatAm markets. And the exciting result is that in Q2 in time for the seasonal pickup and travel planning, we will be live to the vast majority of our hotel shoppers around the globe.","Our job doesn\u2019t end there. We\u2019re working to improve the room level content, the descriptions and photos that give users more confidence to book. We\u2019re working to onboard more partners, including more hotel chains like Starwood and more independent hotels to give users the comfort of booking so far direct. It may take a year to prefect our instant booking offering, to get all the room content in line, to make an even better more seamless booking experience and to educate more users about our unbeatable offer.","Over the past two years, we\u2019ve leveraged our strong profitable hotel base to invest in our next-generation booking technology. While the global instant booking launch will mass our core growth this year, it is an imperative step, as we follow our north star, navigating the path towards creating the best user experience in travel.","Now shifting gears, a bit, how many people book a vacation simply because they want to stay at a particular hotel? The answer, not many. We travel because we want to relax. We want to discover. We seek adventure. We want to create great memories with friends or family. In short, we want to do stuff, TripAdvisor is in the business of delivering these memorable experiences, the TripAdvisor brand is synonymous with inspiration, discovery and helping users plan and have a great trip.","And unlike most of the travel brands users bring TripAdvisor with them on the trip. Over 50% of our traffic visits are on mobile devices. The majority of that on the phone and users have downloaded our apps more than 290 million times. When you arrive in your destination, TripAdvisor is your own personal travel guide, helping you find what to do, where to eat and what businesses to visit and which to avoid.","Our profitable hotel business enables us to invest in complementary categories, attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals. These are businesses that help you service have a great trip. Engage more users and more moments and create a stickier end-to-end travel experience. The categories also opened up our global platform to more advertising partners helping them grow their business.","Drilling down on this other segment, over the long-term, we believe attractions can be our next billion-dollar revenue business. It's a fragmented 80 billion market opportunity in the U.S. and Europe alone. It has attractive commission rates. We're already the clear leader in terms of content and audience and adding Viator transaction capabilities reinforces our lead. We're growing quickly, leveraging the best to what TripAdvisor and Viator have to offer.","In 2015, the Viator team did a great job launching marketplace. Nearly tripling the number of bookable properties from 11,000 to 32,000. Matching great attractions content with more supply towards for more consumers, we saw TripAdvisor\u2019s sourced bookings on Viator grow rapidly in 2015.","In 2016, we focused on making it even easier for users to book. This quarter, we're launching instant booking on TripAdvisor for attractions on both mobile and desktop. We're leveraging our large install base with app users to deliver timely app notifications, making bookings an easier experience for travelers when they are in market. We believe that capturing only single-digit market share will enable attractions to become our next billion-dollar revenue business.","We have a great opportunity in restaurants as well. We've rapidly expanded the forum [ph] both organically and inorganically, launching in Denmark during the fourth quarter. We now operate in 12 countries and have more than 33,000 bookable restaurants for travelers and locals alike. User demand is growing rapidly as well. People have restaurants for few reasons. One, we're delighting users more frequently with helpful rich content all around the world. Two, through the forum, we're helping users seamlessly book great places to eat. And three, our content drives millions of visitors to TripAdvisor more frequently keeping us top of mind even when the users isn't in travel planning mode.","Rounding up the other segment, our vacation rentals business continues to post great results as it owns its free-to-list transaction model. We generated more than 65% of vacation rentals revenue from free-to-list in 2015 and more than 70% of the 770,000 properties are now bookable online.","As I conclude, 2016 is another important year and another journey to build the best user experience in travel. We are in a great position right now. But our industry continues to evolve and competition abounds. For these reasons, we have to move quickly and launch instant booking around the globe. We also need to continue to invest in our end-to-end user experience, invest in mobile and invest in growing supply and driving higher conversions in all of our major product categories.","As a result, expenses will likely grow faster than revenue this year as they did in 2015. But this is the right path forward on our journey. We always manage our business for the long-term. This is the best way to build the business that creates the most value for our users, our clients and our shareholders.","And now, here is Ernst.","Ernst Teunissen","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone.","My first three months on the job have allowed me to understand our business close up and what strikes me is that while the company has achieved so much in its short history from Steve all the way down in the organization, the company is deeply committed to make sure our future is even better still. This commitment to improve and willingness to adapt to achieve greatness is very unique to our company culture.","When I look at the $1.3 trillion travel market and I compare our TripAdvisor's significant influence on travel commerce with how under monetized we are, I see a massive growth opportunity ahead. We're experiencing near-term headwinds as we roll out instant booking. But once we've established our end-to-end product offering, we have positioned ourselves to drive growth and better monetization in the future. With that as a backdrop, let's review our Q4 and our full year 2015 results.","First comment is that our financial results should be viewed in light of significant currency headwinds. Full year 2015 revenue grew 20% in reported currency versus 27% in constant currency. And adjusted EBITDA was flat in reported currency versus 14% growth in constant currency. Q4 revenue grew 7% to reported currency or 12% in constant currency and adjusted EBITDA growth in Q4 was negative 11% in reported currency versus negative 2% in constant currency.","Note that our Q4 GAAP net income of $3 million or $0.02 per diluted share was largely impacted by a one-time non-cash item to settle our pledge obligation with the TripAdvisor charitable foundation. A total of $67 million was paid in company common stock. This one-time settlement means that moving forward, we will not contribute part of our profits to the foundation which will be a net benefit to EBITDA, to give you a sense of the size of its impact, this would have been a net reduction of $8 million in 2015 without the settlement.","Q4 hotel segment revenue growth was 4% or approximately 8% in constant currency and hotel adjusted EBITDA margin was 37%. Digging into the hotel business, as expected Q4 click-based revenue declined 1% in reported currency or grew 5% in constant currency. 2015 can really be characterized as a tail of two halves. We had nice growth in the first half followed by deceleration due to a lower and meta CPC pricing, as well as dilution from our instant booking rollout in the U.S. and the UK. These trends were most pronounced in Q4.","We estimated our accelerated instant booking rollout in the U.S. and the UK, our two largest markets, negatively impacted Q4 revenue by $9 million and EBITDA by $6 million.","For the full year 2015, we estimate instant booking negatively impacted revenue by $36 million, and EBITDA by $26 million.","Another trend is the ongoing consumer shift to mobile devices. Phone hotel shoppers grew 36% during at 2015, while combined desktop and tablet shoppers grew 10%. Phone hotel shoppers accounted for approximately 30% of our total hotel shoppers during Q4, and monetize at approximately 30% of rate of desktop and tablet in Q4. This compares to 19% the rate last year.","Obviously, the continued lower monetization rate relative to other devices forces a continued headwind to aggregate revenue per shopper growth, resulting in revenue per shopper growth decelerating. Even while both desktop and phone individually are growing in revenue per shopper.","This ongoing U.S. user shift to mobile is a key strategic driver for instant booking as the frequency of use and smaller screen size plays an even higher premium on delivering a simple end-to-end value proposition. It's true that we're seeing strong repeat booking rates on our mobile app experience and we continue to optimize helping more users find and book hotels with these.","Now moving to our other segment. Revenue growth normalized to 32% in Q4 as we fully lapped our 2014 acquisitions. Q4 adjusted EBITDA margins were negative 16% due to this category's high revenue seasonality and therefore low relative Q4 revenues against this largely fixed cost structure.","Moving on to consolidated expenses and cash flow. Consolidated expenses grew ahead of revenue for Q4 and for the full year, reflecting the continued investment in our future growth. As for taxes, our Q4 GAAP effective tax rate was 17%, which was lower than our expectations, due to a change in jurisdictional earnings and certain discrete items. We expect our 2016 GAAP effective tax rate to be in the mid-20s and is dependent of course our international revenue and expense mix among other factors.","On cash flow, we generated $74 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter or 24% of revenue. CapEx for the quarter was $16 million or 5% of revenue. In 2016, we expect CapEx would decrease, Q4 free cash flow was $58 million or 19% of revenue and we generated $273 million of free cash flow during the full year.","Our liquidity remains strong. As our cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities balance was $698 million at the end of Q4. We also ended the year with an undrawn balance of about $800 from our $1 billion credit facility.","We also have $104 million remaining under our share repurchase program. That was my summary of the 2015 financial results. Now let's look ahead to 2016 and beyond. We operated a very dynamic travel market space and within that dynamic marketplace, we are shifting our business rapidly to capture the long-term opportunity. We will be faced with important decision points throughout 2016 as we execute, such as how to best promote this great new booking experience.","Because we manage our business for the long-term, throughout 2016, we will do what we think is necessary to optimize the multi-year financial outcome, not necessarily what we'll make us a hit any specific 2016 financial results. For this reason, we are discontinuing our past practice of providing a guidance range for annual revenue and EBITDA. Instead, I will provide you with directional expectations for 2016 and 2017 for our two reporting segments as well as for total expenses. We believe that these building blocks provide a good foundation for modeling our business and actually provide greater insight into underlying trends than we\u2019ve offered in the past. Moreover, I will share some early data points on our instant booking progress.","So, let\u2019s start with the hotel segment. As we think about 2016, we need to first start with our 2015 exit rates. We exited Q4 2015 with 4% growth in the hotel segment, and negative 1% growth for a click-based revenue. Note that these growth rates decelerated from 8% and 6% respectively in Q3. As we look at the first half of 2016, we expect that these growth rates to decelerate further due to the tougher first half 2015 Meta CPC comps as well as near-term dilution of our instant booking roll out this quarter and next.","Importantly, we anticipate that revenue per hotel shopper and therefore both click-based revenue growth and hotel segment growth rates will reaccelerate in the back half of the year as we start lapping the instant booking roll out in the U.S. and the UK and also meet easier Meta CPC pricing comps. Despite this reacceleration in the second half, we expect growth for the full year to be muted.","Throughout 2016, we will continue to invest to improve supply, content and marketing and as such, we expect expense growth to outpace revenue growth in the hotel segment resulting in margin contraction in the hotel segment. As we look out to 2017, we believe the higher second half 2016 exit rates and lapping the full instant booking roll out pertain to growth acceleration. We also believe our hotel segment margins will stabilize in 2017 and potentially expand as revenue reacceleration does not require similar expense growth.","So a reasonable question is why are we willing to take such significant near-term financial impact from this instant booking roll out? Firstly, we believe instant booking presents a massive long-term growth opportunity for us. Our revenue per hotel shopper is currently in order of magnitude lower than that of our largest partners. That monetization difference represents a multi-billion-dollar opportunity for us. Instant booking plays a key role.","Looking at our longest standing cohort to U.S., instant booking is already more than 50% of revenues on our mobile app; that percentages much lower on other devices, but it speaks to the instant bookings potential to become a substantial part of our business over the next few years.","Our second reason is that we are seeing some positive trends. One, instant booking conversion rates improved throughout 2015 and are now comparable to Meta. Showing that we are improving the product and the users are getting increasingly comfortable booking on TripAdvisor. We fully expect to improve conversion rates further.","Two, average booking values increased by more than 10% over the course of the year. We attribute this to our success partnering with big global hotel partners as well as adding The Priceline Group on to the platform.","Three, partners are paying double-digit commission rates for bookings on average and we think this is perhaps misunderstood. This is consistent across each of our different partner types, OTAs, chains and independents.","Four, and perhaps most importantly, we\u2019re seeing positive early signs of repeat usage. Hotel shoppers are increasingly returning to TripAdvisor to complete the booking that was previously attempted, but abandoned. Additionally, 10% of instant bookings are coming from users who have booked with us before, which is great because this is still such a new product for most of our users.","Now the addition of instant booking doesn\u2019t mean metasearch is going away, far from it, we expect metasearch will remain a large part of our total revenues and we see significant opportunity to continue to grow. A huge number of hotel shoppers are in research mode and we\u2019re aiming to turn most of these lookers into clickers. In meta, only a fraction of hotel shoppers clicks on a paid link. This represents an additional source of leakage in our hotel business and as a large monetization opportunity in its own right.","Additionally, given the success other internet companies have had with retargeting we\u2019re launching a similar product this year enabling metasearch partners to buy in a more targeted profitable fashion.","In 2016, our focus as a management team is on revenue per hotel shopper. As this metric is a key to the long-term growth of our hotel segment. Revenue per hotel shopper includes both instant booking and meta and growing this aggregate total is all complete what we\u2019re after. We expect revenue per shopper growth to decelerate as a result of our instant booking launch and later in the year, we believe that growth will improve similar to what we saw in our metasearch rollout in 2013.","Now turning our attention to the 2016 trends in the other segment. Our other segment exited 2015 at a 32% growth in Q4, and we expect continued solid top-line growth in 2016. We've operated the segment as slightly below breakeven EBITDA margins over the past year and we will continue to reinvest in 2016 as we focus on product improvements and supply acquisition. Therefore, EBITDA margins are likely to contract and lower absolute EBITDA could result.","In line with the three to five-year time horizon, we outlined for this segment last year, in 2017, we believe margins will begin to stabilize and could potentially expand as greater revenue scale does not require similar levels of investment. Of course, these trends will not include any acquisitions that we may make over this timeframe.","Finally, some specific thoughts on our 2016 organic investments as well as how we might deploy capital during the year. We've built the business with significant operational scale on one that enables us to execute this major business shift at speed, and maintain our focus on the long-term. In 2016, we will continue to invest in people to pursue our product and sales initiatives and indirect expense growth rates should be similar to 2015. We expected our direct sales and marketing expenses to continue to grow, but at a materially lower rates than the 48% growth, we experienced in 2015.","In addition, to organic investments, we continue to have significant financial capacity for inorganic growth. We are very pleased with the acquisitions we've made over the last few years and remain open to similar opportunities to consolidate great businesses with innovative products and great management teams. Although, we look at many opportunities, we remain very selective and our focus on return on investment and long-term value creation.","We also continue to evaluate alternative ways to deploy our capital, including share repurchases. In conclusion, I'll leave you with four structural advantages unique to our business.","First, we are extending our league as the trusted brand in user-generated content, which is making our product better every day, driving audience and help support low overall customer acquisition cost.","Second, we have a superior consumer value proposition helping users plan, compare prices and book hotels all-in-one place.","Third, we have complementary businesses that help users to route their entire trip, driving increased loyalty, usage frequency and additional revenue streams.","Four, our ownership structure is an advantage as Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings supports our long-term view.","So, to summarize, we believe we're on the right path to create long-term value. After some near-term pressures on revenues and profits, we believe our results will improve later this year and into 2017.","We'll now open up the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Lloyd Walmsley","Thanks. I guess first just I think if I heard you right, you said the instant book headwind in the fourth quarter was only 9 million versus 10 million last quarter despite having it rolled out across the entire quarter. Can you just talk about what drove that improvement, was it take rate driven, was it conversion driven? Can you give us some color there; I guess that's the first question I have.","Ernst Teunissen","Yes. Lloyd, I'll take that question. What you do have to keep in mind is that Q4 is a smaller quarter than Q3 of course and you have to look at the gap in that line. But we are seeing as I was highlighting, we are seeing improvements in our instant book business that we believe will overtime help us reduce that monetization gap I highlighted continued improvement in conversion rates, improvement in the average booking value of the business. And so despite the fact that we're rolling it out further and our instant book revenue as a percentage of our total revenues is increasing, we are able to maintain a similar type of headwind.","Lloyd Walmsley","Great. And as a follow-up I guess when you look at kind of other international markets like EMEA on a revenue per user basis, it\u2019s a fraction of what North America is. Can you just talk about how much of that is the lower monetization of hotel shoppers versus just a traffic skew away from hotel shoppers more towards the other that might explain that and kind of is instant book when you look at there is early international markets, is it less of a drag relative to meta, was there kind of a bigger opportunity there?","Ernst Teunissen","Yes, if you look at EMEA, the only market where we rolled out instant book in 2015 is the UK. And so that\u2019s a very dilutive impact on the total EMEA number that you look at. But our monetization, our revenue per shopper outside of the United States is lower, which is driven by lower CPCs in those markets.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC, your line is open.","Mark Mahaney","Two questions, please, if you could just comment on whether you\u2019re seeing any macro drags in any of the international markets? And then any updated thoughts on brand awareness, TV advertising, campaigns in the last quarter, I think you decided to kind of trim that back a little bit, is that still the same or in terms of the expense guide for this year being greater than revenue guide, is there a rethink on the usefulness of running a broader TV campaign? Thank you.","Ernst Teunissen","I'll take the first question - and give the second to Steve. In terms of the macro in the fourth quarter, we saw some impact from the Paris attacks we believe, in order of magnitude, impacted our fourth quarter revenues by 1.5% to 2% of our revenues into January. We don\u2019t see a discernible impact of the macro environment, but we\u2019re keeping our eye on it very closely obviously.","Stephen Kaufer","This is Steve. On the TV branding campaign as I indicated before, we planned to pull back on that or separately focused instead on the traffic that\u2019s already on our side, because we have so many hotel shoppers that are already in the intent to purchase and in many cases the booking path, so turning our sites on converting those folks rather than a broader-based campaign.","Mark Mahaney","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.","Eric Sheridan","Thank you very much. Just maybe one on the theme of conversion, you talked about conversion now being comparable to meta, what have you seen over the last six months in the improvements, in conversion maybe you can tease out a little bit of how desktop versus mobile has evolved and what some of the partnerships that have come in like Marriott and price - meant for those conversion improvements and how we should be thinking about conversion going forward? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer","Clearly, the huge impact on conversion for us was being able to bring on over the course of 2015 all of the - or almost all of the big brands and the whole Priceline Group bringing their very strong inventory, excellent content and great pricing. So, it really kind of up the opportunity for TripAdvisor to be showing a great price with all this content. Very hard for us to tease out exactly what causes conversion rate to lift, but we're confident in saying the extra or the better content that we added to the site certainly helped.","As we look forward, it\u2019s mostly tuning if you will, there is a lot of properties that are available, we want to make sure that we have great pricing on as many of them or all of them as we can, we want to make sure we have a great experience in terms of someone entering the booking flow and getting all of the information that they need in order to make that in order to trust us with their credit card, or storing their credit card, so we\u2019re doing all of the things and that\u2019s why we're seeing the improved rate, I\u2019m not sure I would point to a single big win factor that\u2019s going to be out there versus incremental improvement and I said, the incremental improvement will likely translate to all points of sale at the same time. We\u2019re not seeing a big difference per market in terms of how consumers are behaving.","Conversion, you asked about the phone versus desktop and so the conversion naturally is different, some of that I believe is going to be structural for quite some time. Both we measure when we talk about rev per shopper with you folks, we are also of course measuring it both mobile web, mobile app, tablet, desktop. We've got to broken down in lots of different ways here and we're constantly making improvements in each of those categories.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Merwin of Barclays. Your line is open.","Christopher Merwin","Great. Thank you. I just had a couple. One of the changes that you made in instant book is to feature the brand of your partners in the booking process. So what is the feedback then from your partners' to-date in terms of their satisfaction with the product?","And you talked a bit about how the repeat booking rates are getting better. So does that mean that you're starting to see some of these repeat economics accrued at TripAdvisor rather than necessarily the supplier.","And then just a second question as you roll out instant book internationally, have you been able to get all the content you need globally especially after the Priceline deal to drive further improvements in conversion and maybe relative to the domestic growth, can you just tell us a bit about how the international rollout has been performing at this stage of the game. Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer","So, I'll go in reverse order. We're very happy with the Priceline deal, the content that it provides, the pricing so, and their ability to handle the infrastructure of the payments in all these different countries. And as I alluded to last quarter, we thought that would allow us to roll it out fairly quickly and we've delivered on that. Priceline team has been great to work with. So, as you know, as we disclosed, we launched in Europe launching LatAm and another market. So that will mostly be done over the next 90-120 days. So, that's great. It absolutely was the meaningful factor and us to accelerate our global rollout, which kind of starts the training purpose or training clock going, because we know we have a hill to climb, teach people that TripAdvisor is not only awesome for research, but a safe place to book and by offering great content, great prices, we think we are doing that where it's available.","So, we're not doing that yet in a bunch of countries because we don't have any instant booking rolled out in those countries. So, if you think that half a little bit, when we look at this consumer journey, I talk about instead of searching around lots and lots of different sites for all the information and then all the prices. Our vision, our strategic plan here is you come to TripAdvisor because of all that great content, and then of course you see that we've done the work for you, we've searched the web, we've pulled back all of these prices and with instant booking, odds are good and becoming great that we'll be able to feature the lowest price if you want to book on TripAdvisor, if in fact you have royalty to a different site that's great. There is a meta button that clicks over there. If you prefer booking brand direct and you really want to be on that brand site, great, there is a brand click. If you are happy booking on TripAdvisor with that being fulfilled by brand, we'll have that option. If you are happy booking on TripAdvisor fulfilled by a great OTA partner, excellent.","We'd like to look at it as no matter what your preferences are, we'll have you - we'll be able to address your need in our store and then you made the purchase, you stay at the hotel, you're in market, you get to use all of our attractions, you're using our app because so many people do and so we've stayed with you during this travel purchase and all of that is supposed to yield more rate and now I'm used to TripAdvisor as a research and a booking tool. And the leading indicator I like to look at the most is that repeat rate, is that exactly a perfect metric for showing that instant booking is working. You can't tell. Well, time will tell. But it is the thing that we are looking to address and build as a long-term advantage in the instant booking path versus the meta path, because as people are comfortable booking with us and for some people trial is the only way they're going to get comfortable. Then we're delivering a good experience, the product works and they come back and book again.","So that's why I love the repeat rate. Did I forget your first question now, first half of your question?","Christopher Merwin","No, I think it was mostly, it was just really on, I guess maybe the pace of the international rollout relative to domestic, just how that's going so far if it's kind of on the same trend line.","Stephen Kaufer","Well since we already rolled out in all of our English markets, or rolled out U.S., UK first and that\u2019s a lot of our traffic. We were able to test a lot of the scalability question marks that we had and kind of we passed those and that was a slower rollout as we went to a percentage of traffic and then as we roll out to the rest of the world, we\u2019re a lot more comfortable that our infrastructure can handle the load and so we tend to roll out quicker, again as an example in the past 45 days rolled out to, it's probably a dozen more markets since the beginning of the year and as I indicated we expect the pace to continue with that rate such that it\u2019ll be out in the next quarter or so, with all or almost all of our major markets.","Product looks good. There is - when we say we launched it, it gives us instant booking capabilities, primarily with booking.com as our partner and then we are working aggressively to bring the rest of our suppliers, all the different brands and obviously the independents to all these new markets. One thing that slows us down is that for some of our partners we don\u2019t have all of the room content in the language that we\u2019re rolling out in, so we need to go back and get that before we can turn some of those partners live.","When I talk about it being a year or two to get instant booking to really be fully rolled out with all of the value that I talked about all the room content, all of this pricing it\u2019s because there is a lot of work still to be done to get all the partners with all the content and all the languages, handling payments in all the markets and we\u2019re on that road and we\u2019re accelerating our pace.","Christopher Merwin","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Sena with Evercore. Your line is open.","Ken Sena","Hi. Thanks. When Expedia reported yesterday there was a mention that Airbnb in the margin is a positive and I was just wondering if you\u2019d agree with that statement in terms of what you\u2019re seeing? And also you mentioned, speed a few times in the slide, there was a mention of the mobile product as being the perfect travel companion. How pleased are you with the current mobile experience from a product standpoint? And are you concerned at all by some of the recent iterations that you\u2019re seeing from Google on the SEO side? Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. I mean Airbnb offers an interesting product. We have a very competitive product in that space. But we come at it more from a - look the individual who is looking for a great place to stay in London and they might pick a hotel, they might pick an apartment, they might pick even a more traditional vacation until our supply footprint covers them all and we\u2019re growing that around the globe. So in the sense Airbnb as a competitor, we don\u2019t particularly view their traffic or the person looking for the shared room with someone that\u2019s actually on TripAdvisor, but for the other piece for the city or for the urban inventory we do.","Hard to say given the strength of the hotel industry currently that Airbnb is a problem, they've just added a lot of supply into the equation and I personally believe that they\u2019re generating more travel on the part of consumers because of the supply that they\u2019ve added. I have no data point to back that up, but it\u2019s kind of logical to me as they continue to grow but the hotel companies and folks like us and the others, other OTAs continue to be very strong in our markets.","In terms of the mobile experience, the tough question there is various aspects of our app and our experience that I think are just terrific. You can find great places to eat nearby where you\u2019re standing, all around the globe, you can book the hotel, store to your credit card, it's two clicks and you\u2019re done. There is tremendous amount of benefit that we've achieved I believe by delivering a great user experience for closing hotel shopping, places to eat, things to do, bringing the book ability of our attraction inventory on the phone, really, really nice.","From - is there more to do? Absolutely I just think that the amount of data that TripAdvisor has that can help you plan a trip that is so hard for us to figure out how to surface at the right time, really hard to read your mind to know what you\u2019re going to be looking for next. But we've got it. Because we have so much users, so many users, we have so much data on all topics related to travel plus we've got the community standing behind us. So do we bring that all to the forefront in a perfect way on the mobile small screen? No.","So, I still think we are in very early days and we can do that we are incredibly well positioned because of the rich content across all travel categories and because of our installed app footprint, which is as you know just huge. So, it's a way more opportunity ahead of us than we have tackled already.","Ken Sena","Thank you. And just maybe anything on the Google front in terms of the micro moment and some of the recent iterations that they have been making there?","Stephen Kaufer","Sorry, we certainly keep an eye on them. But, we never are able to detect whether their products have an impact on our business, we're at such scale and that's a very recent release on their part. So, there could be a factor at some point down the road who knows I think I've said that to 8 or 10 different Google product iterations over the past decade, then my answer is still the same.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Peck with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Robert Peck","Thanks for taking my question. Two quick questions if I can. One, hotel shopper growth decelerated in the quarter a little albeit of a much tougher comp. Steve, as we think about that going forward, how should we think about modeling that going forward, what expectations would be there and Ernst on M&A you've talked about that a little bit today. I know you can't see what you would acquire. But as you look at the portfolio of assets you have, can you just give us directionally some area that are more interesting than others? Thanks so much.","Ernst Teunissen","I'll take both questions. So, on the revenue per shopper, as you pointed out, we did decelerate in Q4 on revenue per hotel shopper. In total, revenue per hotel shopper declined by 12% and there is a couple of things, if you unpack that and if you think about modeling that for the future, there is a couple of things going on there. One, important driver is currency which had a significant impact on that in the fourth quarter in particular. The second factor we have to consider is that this is an aggregate number across all devices and our mobile revenue per shopper is growing much more quickly. Sorry, our number of mobile shoppers is growing much more quickly. So, you get a mix shift which drags down the average.","Having said that, we are very seriously improving our revenue per shopper in mobile. In constant currency terms, in 2015, we improved revenue per shopper and mobile buy about 30%, so we're improving, but it's still significantly lower monetization than desktop, which is a negative impact. And then we had of course instant book in the fourth quarter which also negatively impacts that as revenue per hotel shopper growth.","So, as you think about that going forward, we do expect further pressure on for if you just aggregate now the desktop revenue per hotel shopper and the mobile revenue per hotel shopper, particularly on desktop, but also on mobile, we expect a negative pressure on that in the first half before the growth rate improves again on that revenue per hotel shopper.","Stephen Kaufer","I'd just pop in for a second. To the part of the question on the kind of absolute number of hotel shoppers, it's clearly growing stronger on the phone. We're not projecting a lot of growth going forward on the desktop, tablets, simply because the user behavior is shifting. When we look at modeling going forward, it's tough for us to do as well. But, I would point out the cycle if you will of as our revenue per hotel shopper improves, we are able to acquire more traffic on ours for breakeven traffic basis and of course we're always trying to acquire more hotel shopper traffic growth.","Simply put if we make more money per hotel shopper visitor, we can bid more on search engines and other traffic generating sources. So, some of the decline in the hotel shopper absolute number in Q4 would be related to our lower rev per shopper number, which in term means we were able to buy a bit less, as that flips around second half of next year or whenever it does you\u2019ll get to see some of that growth reappear.","Will Lyons","And this is Will let me jump in on the revenue per hotel shopper growth because there are some questions coming in, just note that revenue per hotel shopper is a TA number, so we are taking the hotel shoppers from TripAdvisor, not including the hotel shoppers from our subsidiary sites, whereas if you\u2019re doing the math on the supplemental style, you\u2019ll be using TripAdvisor hotel shoppers and if you\u2019re dividing the revenue from a consolidated basis you are including subsidiary revenue so just keep that in mind as you\u2019re looking at that ratio.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom White with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Thomas Cauthorn White","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just a clarifying sort of definitional question. When you say that conversion rates on instant booking a comparable to meta what exactly do you mean that, does that mean that it\u2019s comparable to kind of downstream conversion that your partner resulting from meta clicks?","And then just also in terms of the impact of instant booking on meta know that you\u2019ve got a bit more data are you seeing any signs that kind of your highest quality users the ones that are kind of closest to converting are disproportionally entering the instant booking funnel, potentially at the expense of CPC pricing in the meta auction if that\u2019s kind of where the lower quality or sort of left by the way to convert users are going, just trying to get a sense of maybe any changes to CPC pricing in the meta auction? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. So yes, from the definitional perspective, when we talked about ID conversion, it\u2019s folks that enter our booking funnel and come out the other end as the transaction compared to meta, we send the click off to a partner and some of those partners we have some conversion related information, so we can tell what percent of leads we sent turn into a transaction. So, right we say it\u2019s comparable, it varies a lot of course type of property, point of sale, given time in year, so we\u2019re just trying to point out that we\u2019ve achieved comparable to meta.","Ernst Teunissen","And to your second question what trends do we see within? It\u2019s a little bit early to say exactly what trends we see of or which type of users would migrate from meta to instant book, but it\u2019s something we are watching quite closely. You\u2019re by the way identifying also why we are really focused on the aggregate revenue per shopper improvements because some of this interplay between Meta and instant book are a little bit more complex and you may think of the surface.","Thomas Cauthorn White","Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one follow-up on the conversion rate issue, Steve is it fair to think that you guys could actually get instant booking conversion rates that are higher than kind of the downstream conversions in meta just based on the fact that there is one less kind of step, you don\u2019t need to click off and kind of the opportunities to drop off the funnel in meta? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. In some cases, a lot has to do with the user intents, right so. We presume our big meta partners have a lot of user intent that says, hey I'm going to their site and I'm ready to book, so they drive right through the funnel conversion rate very high.","We have some percentage of our traffic coming to TripAdvisor, arguably most of our traffic I mean the TripAdvisor right now with high research intent and we\u2019re pulling through the funnel and get them to click off to a partner sometimes they convert. If we\u2019re able to train folks to come to TripAdvisor when they are ready to book, then we believe more likely to go down the instant book pass or conversion rate would be higher than our average traffic we sent off to meta. Yeah that\u2019s a very believable, very it\u2019s a thesis that we\u2019d love to prove to be true sooner or rather than later.","I wouldn\u2019t say it makes our Meta leads any less quality, I think it\u2019s just a testament to that, we can successfully be driving a higher intent purchase to TripAdvisor when they\u2019re ready to do that booking.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Heath Terry","Great, thanks. I was wondering if you could just give us a sense of as you present more of the sort of dual track options within your search result giving people that option of choosing between meta and instant book on desktop, can you give us a sense of what proportion they\u2019re sort of choosing each one of those options and as you\u2019ve added more partners within instant book to the extent that is having any impact on the way that the customers or the rate of customers are choosing instant book versus meta?","Stephen Kaufer","Well, we have a lot of options there. So, the display that you currently see on our site, I can almost promise you it will change somehow at some point because we are still iterating. What you are referring to I believe is what we internally call the distribution, so when someone is looking at a hotel page what percentage of clicking on instant book versus top meta offering versus the second, third, et cetera. And so majority of the clicks are still going into the meta flow versus instant book on average, and we don\u2019t necessarily view that as a bad thing for where we are today.","We know we can influence that a lot depending on how we choose to present instant book as an option. We do carefully measure I don\u2019t disclose but we carefully measure the conversion rate for instant book when our presses are as good versus not as good versus better than meta options and you can imagine that has an impact and when - and the biggest thing that we can do to your question is to actually get instant booking available on more of our properties in more markets than sort of build more or partners underneath the instant booking placement.","So in the U.S. for instance, we have really coverage right now, you look at most any city for most any hotel and there is probably, if it\u2019s bookable online, there is probably an instant booking option because we have a good selection of partners between the brands and the OTAs, that is good in one of our newer foreign language markets because we don\u2019t have some of that level of content yet.","Heath Terry","Great. Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brian Fitzgerald","Thanks. As you introduced new formats like meta or instant book, hotels, marketers that\u2019s become familiar and comfortable with the new format, then kind of integrated their campaigns and for that matter hotel shoppers due to become comfortable with it. Could you maybe compare and contrast the meta ramp versus instant book ramp from this regard, any insights there with our lessons learned as you rolled out meta that are making the instant book ramp or rollout to be more efficient? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer","Excellent question, - rollout some of those challenges were more gripping by our client\u2019s ability to upgrade or change their bidding mechanism and styles and measurement based upon what we were doing and we have a lot of partners a lot of clients so we kind of they all have to move forward on the change. With instant booking, a client who has an instant booking partner has to do a decent amount of or some technical work to get integrated but it doesn\u2019t really have much of an effect on all the rest of the partners.","So, all the rest of the meta partners, the rollout scheduling timing is much more under our control because especially with the Priceline Group now, you can basically rollout in just about any market that we want to and we don\u2019t need the other partners to do any technical work. So, lessons learned, look with the meta we needed to give our partners more warning, more sample, more time, a bunch of things, but it doesn\u2019t apply quite as well to the IB [ph] rollout here.","To the question of users changing the behavior, well I think it was lot - meta was lot easier on the users back then because they put in their dates and they just got more information. Hip, Hip Hurray. Here, we actually have to teach them what this book on TripAdvisor button means because it's not the site, it's not what they're used to getting on our site and that's new ground for us and you were doing a bunch of stuff right then I'm sure, I know we will be doing a bunch of stuff differently in the coming year to help drive home this new functionality and the benefits our travelers will receive when they experience instant booking.","Brian Fitzgerald","Great. Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Jed Kelly","Great, thanks. Can you provide any color on how much revenue Viator revenue contributed to 2015 and give us a sense on how you expect Viator to grow in 2016? And then any chance to introduce instant booking to China outbound travelers through Priceline's investment Ctrip?","Ernst Teunissen","I'll take the first one. So we don't break out within our other segment which comprises of Viator but also the fork and our vacation rental business. We don't break out separately the revenues. But Viator is a healthy part of that and it also has very healthy growth rates within that. This is much we want to say about that.","Stephen Kaufer","In terms of China, when we talk about the global IB roll out, China is certainly included in that. We have a deal with the Priceline Group which has tremendous amount of global inventory as well as inventory inside of China directly through Priceline and the ability to transact. So we actually don't need an additional relationship with Ctrip in order to provide instant booking for Chinese travelers, domestic or international. Although obviously we would welcome additional instant booking relationships with every OTA including Ctrip all around the globe.","Jed Kelly","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude our Q&A session. I'd like to turn the call back to Steve Kaufer for closing remarks.","Stephen Kaufer","Great. Well, thank you all for joining on the call and thank you to all TripAdvisor employees for your hard work in 2015. I am very thankful to be able to work with such a great team. 2016 is another important year for our business and we are moving quickly to deliver the best user experience in travel. Thanks all and talk to you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect.

Your line is open.","Deepak Mathivanan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So first, on Non-Hotel, when should we expect the impacts of rentals to kind of moderate from a timing standpoint? You're calling for acceleration in 4Q Non-Hotel revenues. Should we assume that the impact from rentals is starting to moderate starting 4Q?","And then second, on hotel shoppers, you noted that the referrals to partner sites grew in the letter. That's impressive considering the marketing reductions. How would you rank order your marketing efforts versus product initiatives, that's sort of delivering this? And then are you also seeing cost per referrals increase at this time? Thank you.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Deepak, good morning. This is Ernst. I'll take the first question and I'll ask Steve to take the second one. What we called out in our prepared remarks is that there is some seasonality to the relative influence of rentals. Q3 is a quarter in which rentals is relatively larger in the portfolio compared to other quarters and so it had an outsized impact for that reason in the overall rate for Non-Hotel. That is less so in Q4.","And over time, of course, with our restaurant business and our experience business growing quite fast and rentals actually at the moment declining single digit, the mix shift will result into rentals having a smaller and smaller impact.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And this is Steve talking about the referrals that we sent downstream to our partners on lower hotel shopper number. I mean, it's certainly a truism that all shoppers are not created equal and so this is a two-part answer. The first is I think we found better ways to find the type of hotel shoppers that are naturally more interested in booking something right now. So, we're better able to buy, we'll call them, lower funnel shoppers. So the overall number may be lower, but the quality of them coming into the store, to our store, is higher.","And then second, once they're coming in, yes, we continue to make meaningful gains in on-site conversion, especially on the phone, which is driving more downstream referrals. So we don't look specifically at how much we spend per referral, we always look at it as how much profit can we make for every referral that we buy.","Deepak Mathivanan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Ernst.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Two if I can. First, just on the new TripAdvisor Experience. Is there any color you guys can give us on the test markets around engagement and the impact on monetization that gives you the confidence to roll that out to, I think, most of the globe in the next few weeks?","And then the second one would just be I think it was inter-quarter, maybe at our conference, you guys had quantified the marketing efficiencies as in the seventh inning. It looks like you continue to get really good marketing efficiencies even as you've started to lap the beginning of that. So just wondering if you can give us an update on where that initiative is and how much room left you think you have to cut inefficient spend out of the marketing budget? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Hi, Lloyd. Steve here. So I'll take the first one and defer the second to Ernst. So we have been testing, obviously, our new experiences both from a product functionality, as well as what did some users see. It was a closed beta. We let the publishers on.","And of course, we think it's a really great user experience that's going to enable travelers to stop popping or to reduce the popping around to lots of different websites, find all the content they want on TripAdvisor, believe it's trusted from all their sources, and pull them down the funnel. So it's an additive feature, if you will, to our robust ecosystem as opposed to mentally thinking of it as something completely different.","When we look at our test markets, our initial things, I remind everyone that, for the traffic, that's just looking at a hotel, they just want to book a hotel. The site actually isn't very different right now because that component of our \u2013 segment of our traffic that's ready to book is looking at our hotel list page, they're looking at a hotel detail page and they find all the info they want.","The social experience, by design, does not get in the way of any of that. When you look at the homepage and who's coming to the homepage, folks who are looking to plan their trip, looking to figure things out, the top part of the page now offers up more of our product opportunities, so we're not just a hotel search, and then the bottom of the page that wasn't used very much before now has a very rich social experience.","So again, additive and that's what our users are telling us as we've tested it internally, or closed beta, and with some external users is that it's not getting in the way of anything that they were doing. Yay, we care a lot about that, the monetization of our current behavior, but it's now inspiring and offering more reasons to come back.","After the launch, after it kind of rolls out next week, then we're really going to be able to start looking at cohorts of users, how many members do we get, what's the regular weekly repeat, monthly repeat, and all the rest of the metrics that we hope will be driven in a positive direction from this.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And, Lloyd, your question on marketing efficiency, marketing efficiency was a very important driver of our EBITDA improvement year-over-year in our Hotel segment obviously. You saw that the auction was approximately flat year-over-year, yet significant EBITDA increase. We've more or less been able to drive the same number, the same amount of revenue with a lot less advertising.","To your question of which inning we're in, thanks for asking the baseball metaphor. It's a very popular thing in Boston right now. I said seventh inning last quarter. We're probably right now in our eighth inning. We're probably somewhere in the middle on average during Q3. We're getting close to where we think we'll end up, although there is one inning more of opportunity perhaps to capture.","I do want to point out, though, that we were at a much earlier inning at the beginning of last year. So as we enter into 2019, there's a good half year of us still not fully lapping the full impact of the marketing pullback that we have done. So you will see continued \u2013 until about mid-next year, a continued impact on year-over-year EBITDA, but also a continued impact on year-over-year shoppers from that.","So we see that abating by mid-next year, but for instance for Q4, don't expect shoppers to grow. In fact, the year-over-year decline that we saw in Q3 may be even a little bit more pronounced, a little bit more higher in Q4. But then, we're going to be lapping a sort of peak impact moving into 2019. The flipside, of course, is revenue per shopper. Revenue per shopper was up very nicely in Q3, and we see revenue per shopper accelerate a bit more year-over-year in Q4 as well. So you'll see a continued divergence at least until mid-next year of those two metrics that make up auction revenue. But we're very pleased with the marketing efficiency. It's a very nice contributor to the bottom line. We do not think it sets us up badly for the long term. The marketing spend that we have been reducing does not have significant lifetime value. We've not seen negative impact on it or other channels from the marketing pullback, and so we feel very confident that this has been a good reset that sets us up really well for the future.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. Well, thank you, and can't wait for the new experience to try it out. So, good luck with that.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Look forward to your feedback. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey, good morning. For Non-Hotel, EBITDA was strong there. Do you see this as a fairly steady up and to the right trajectory for Non-Hotel EBITDA margins on an annual basis? Or, I guess, are there any significant investments that you might need to potentially make there that could cause margins to be lumpier? Like, so in other words, is there potential for a transition or kind of an investment year in Non-Hotel? Or is this going to be a fairly consistent upward move in margins for this segment? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes. So Non-Hotel EBITDA year-over-year increased by 7% in this quarter, while revenue increased by 20%. So it's a small margin compression this quarter. We're making significant investments, particularly in our Experiences business. Our Experiences business is an area where we're driving for growth and for market share and for expanding a market that is relatively nascent. We made an acquisition, a software company called Bokun, and we're investing very significantly behind that. That investment accelerated in Q3 and will accelerate going forward. And so, that \u2013 in our Non-Hotel portfolio, that is really the area where we are investing both on product supply and marketing.","Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the earlier comment, rentals declining single digits. Was that a quarterly number? Or was that a full-year number?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","That was this quarter.","Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, just on Non-Hotel expenses, I think, they grew 29% year-over-year. Can you give us a sense if direct marketing expenditures related to Non-Hotel grew at a \u2013 grew similar to the overall expense growth rate or if it grew faster?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah. We've seen Non-Hotel expense growth, both on the people side, tech and dev, in particular, but also on direct marketing spend. And so both were important contributors of the cost growth, and it's that what you should take in mind when you look at our total direct marketing spend as a company. So we've decreased this quarter year-over-year total direct selling and marketing costs by $45 million. That is in the context of it being up in Non-Hotel, so it underlines the magnitude of the decrease in the Non-Hotel side.","Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you, and nice quarter.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Dae K. Lee - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. This is Dae on for Doug. Thanks for taking my question. My question is on the TV spend. It decreased year-over-year. Could you share your latest thoughts on where you are with that spend? And what level of spend is built into your 2019 adjusted EBITDA outlook?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes, thanks, Doug (sic) [Dae] (14:03). Yeah, it was a modest $7 million decline year-over-year of TV spend this particular quarter. As you may recall, last year we launched our TV campaign in June, and this year we had a full year of TV spend. So we've spread out the budget, although higher, spread it out more throughout the year. And that resulted in this particular quarter, Q3, being a little lower year-over-year. We're on track to spend the $100 million to $130 million that we indicated. We're probably going to end up somewhere in the middle of that range for this year. TV is performing very nicely for us and that's the reason why we spend as planned. The return that we see from it has been \u2013 has been increasing and improving.","And so we look towards next year, and a couple of things there. Continue to spend on TV next year. We like the channel. It's producing good results for us. In all likelihood going to diversify the message from just a purely hotel shopping experience focus to a broader focus. Including experiences, including other \u2013 and other things. We haven't fully finalized yet what the TV spend will be, but you should take our statement about expecting healthy EBITDA growth next year to give at least some guard rails of the magnitude of TV increase if we increase our TV budget.","Dae K. Lee - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Shweta Khajuria - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. This is Shweta for Mark. In Q3 2017, you started seeing the auction bidding volatility and that has stabilized over the past few quarters. So where or what is it like today and do you think it's back to normal? I know you don't have much control, but what are you seeing right now? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes. Thank you, Shweta. Yeah, indeed. It was Q3 2017 and so if you do the year-over-year comparison, this past Q3 versus Q3 2017, we started to lap all those impacts in Q3. So, Q3 to Q3, it was still a modest negative impact year-over-year for us, but towards the end of the quarter, narrowing in and in Q4, we will have pretty much lapped it with the average. So, Q4 should be a quarter where you \u2013 that impact has been completely lapped.","We've seen stability in our auction really since Q4 last year and have no reason to believe it will change in the near or medium-term future. And so everything has been relatively stable since that \u2013 since that event last year and has been stable in Q3, has been stable at the start of Q4 as well.","Shweta Khajuria - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Naved Khan with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Naved Khan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. Hi. Thanks a lot. Just a couple. So in the \u2013 in the guidance for sort of healthy growth in EBITDA for next year, I guess it's still a preliminary outlook, but by healthy, do you mean \u2013 should we take it to mean high single digit or double digit or what should be the right way to think about it? And then I had a follow-up.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Hi, Naved. Yeah, we're not saying more about that than what we're saying right now. As you point out, it is \u2013 it is early. It's \u2013 we're in our planning, but we did want to call out our expectation for healthy EBITDA growth next year. This has been a year in which we have been in transition and there have been lots of different moving parts and lapping events and we just wanted to provide some early clarity on the direction that we saw EBITDA taking for 2019. But not the right time right now to put a finer point on our statement as made.","Naved Khan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Understood. And then, Steve, maybe you can update us on the mobile hotel shopper monetization. How does it look like as a percentage of desktop hotel shopper?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","So we crossed the 50% number this past quarter in terms of mobile hotel shoppers versus desktop. We continue to grow our mobile hotel shopper \u2013 or both shoppers as well as revenue per shopper on the phone. This is continuing along trend for us now. The product is obviously getting better, shoppers are more comfortable booking on the phone, so the referrals that we send downstream to our partners are booking better.","And our click revenue continues to grow. So while, to be clear, it's still a headwind compared to desktop, it's lessening and you see that in the result of having grown overall revenue per shopper this quarter even with the shift to the phone. So, going well. I'm happy about it on both app and the mobile web.","Naved Khan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. So I think a couple of quarters ago, you said mobile is up to 40% or revenue per mobile shoppers is roughly 40% over desktop shoppers. Is it still around that level? Or has it gone up since then? Any kind of color or clarity?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah. It's still around that level. It's obviously gone up a little bit. It's going up a little every time because our mobile revenue per shopper is growing faster than desktop. But it's still roughly the same. Of course, we take it, if very good desktop performance in any particular quarter may not make that number go up as fast as otherwise. Like we had 10% revenue per shopper improvement on desktop, which was a very nice feature here. But it's improving steadily, but it's still in that sort of 40% ballpark.","Naved Khan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks a lot, guys.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. your line is open","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks so much guys. So maybe two-part question. When you think about some of the improvements you've made on the platform and now looking out over the next one to two years, is there an area of either revenue per hotel shopper or hotel shopper growth where you feel like you can get back to sort of trending more in line with the industry on the topline side, whether it be the overall travel industry growing low to mid-single digits or online travel growing sort of low-double digits?","And then, now that you've have gone through a period of efficiencies and performance marketing and testing and learning on EV, how should we be thinking about the level of investments made that needed to be made to get back to those levels of growth as well as you look out? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. I'll take this a stab at that. Thanks, Eric. So when we look over the next year or two, we come at it, remember, from this close to half a billion travelers on our site with a huge number of hotel shoppers. So our opportunity to get folks to come back more and more as we pull them down the funnel to become hotel bookers remains huge, just based upon our current reach.","If you think of the new TripAdvisor with the social layer, follows, the ability to get inspired, those are wonderful travel features. But if you look behind the curtain, you see that they're going to be, we expect, pulling folks back to TripAdvisor when they're getting closer and closer to buy mode. That's going to take our revenue per shopper, we would hope, up. So even with the current traffic building on that repeat, building those memberships with our current business model drives nice potential rev per shopper gains, which on the breadth of our traffic, could be huge for us.","Second point, we have our media products. So again, looking at all of the travelers, all of the visitors to the site who are not currently in book mode, but are still planning a trip. We have a nice display business. We have a fast growing ads business in both restaurant and hotels. And that's another way that we get to take advantage of the fact that we have so much traffic on both desktop and the phone because the products are priced the same. But back to the point of the opportunity for us to better leverage the up funnel traffic enables us to grow revenue without necessarily growing top of funnel the way that we've been measuring it before.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen & Co. Your line is open.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks a lot. Can you give us just an update on your business trends from Google, both how you're doing on the SEO side and also on the paid search side in the Hotel and Non-Hotel? In the Hotel side, to what extent have you been able to use Google Hotel price ads in the mix? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. So we never give specific commentary on the SEO, but we are certainly always watching and noting how Google is interrupting the search results with their own products, and we continue to point out that that's not particularly fair for a dominant search engine to do, but accepting it as a reality in several countries and all of our modeling takes that into account.","Ernst talked a lot about the paid search channels and Google is a very big paid search channel for us. So, I think that story is already fairly clear. In the Non-Hotel category, we continue to grow our paid search marketing efforts as, again, not a profitable basis, but as always, like any Internet company, an excellent way to acquire new trial for our product.","To Google Hotel price ads in particular, yes, we have been using them for a while. It continues to do quite well for us. We run it on a profitable basis and it's delivering top line as well as bottom-line and we would expect it to continue to do so.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And in terms of \u2013 in volume terms -","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","If I could just add, in volume terms in this quarter. So the revenue per shopper year-over-year decline \u2013 I'm sorry, the shopper decline year-over-year is purely driven by our pullback on our marketing channel, including Google as a marketing channel and all the other channels, the non-paid channels, including SEO, our performance has been very robust this quarter. So, if you look at sort of a point to explanation of shopper growth softness, it is purely to our pay channels.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, Ernst and Steve. That's really helpful. If I could ask one other question, just looking at Q3, can you give us any more color on specifically the biggest changes that you made to drive ad ROI in the quarter and how much was \u2013 how much of the incremental ROI improvement was related to flagship brand versus other hotel brands? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Most of the improvements was our flagship TripAdvisor brand. That's where we have made the most changes. We did call out that our other hotel area revenue line where we have non-TripAdvisor hotel brands that we've also make some adjustments, but the big impact was in TripAdvisor.","We've continued to increase our sophistication, at which we look at the relationship between marketing spend and downstream creation of bookings for our partners and we've again found ways of optimizing there. And get better efficiency from our channel. As I said out to \u2013 point out to an earlier question, we're going to see the benefit of that in Q4. We're going to see the benefit of that in next year until we lap that somewhere in the middle of next year.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, Ernst.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","I want to call out, like, additionally call out just like the difference between Q3 and Q1 and Q2 year-over-year was, of course, that in Q1 and Q2, we had \u2013 we were spending TV, where in 2017 Q1 and Q2, we hadn't or only in June of Q2 and so that was more normalized this quarter. So, you now see \u2013 in Q3, you see a more normalized TV year-over-year. So you see a more significant impact coming through in the marketing line from the pullback on marketing that you saw in the previous quarters.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, Ernst.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Tom White with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.","Thomas White - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Hello. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just the comment about growth in hotel shoppers sent to the partner sites despite hotel shoppers being down overall, Steve, you mentioned on-site conversion improvements, particularly on phone. I was just wondering if you could provide a little more color on maybe some examples of exactly what those improvements were. I presume it's a bunch of different sort of UI tweaks, but I would be curious to hear what types of changes are the most impactful.","And then in the prepared remarks, hotel media ads, sounds like that was strong in that display based and subscription line. Any kind of numbers you can give us on the growth trajectory there or color on the types of hotels adopting it or average monthly spend? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. I'll take a stab. So on the impactful sort of conversion, again, both desktop and phone, we do a lot of our development on a common framework. So when we roll something out, it works on both platforms, at least mobile web and desktop. And you have relatively straightforward things like making it easier for folks to be entering their dates and you have more sophisticated things such as building the sort order for what hotels are shown to unique individuals as customers to put the best hotel in front of them at the best time. And when we make it easier for folks to find what they are looking for, not surprisingly, the click rates improve.","We also have done a lot of work on the pricing engine. So compared to last year, we are showing better prices to our travelers through a better set of clients as well as just making sure that the best prices surfaced at the right time.","You're absolutely right. There's no kind of one big thing that's driving that revenue per shopper conversion, but rather the sum of quite a few. And as I think we had mentioned earlier, a lot more of our focus on testing has been moving to the phones, so we're seeing arguably more low-hanging fruit there for us to pick up in terms of the rev per shopper numbers.","On the hotel media, or media in general for restaurants and hotels, the sponsor placements, the Trip ads, again, we see continued growth. Certainly year-over-year we had nothing in the hotel sponsor placements line item, and now it's a nice business for us. Restaurants, we had products, and we continue to grow.","Those are all part of what we call our Hotel Solutions and Restaurant Solutions business units which continue to take advantage of what we call the up-funnel traffic, taking advantage of folks that are generally still shopping around, not quite ready to book and hotels and restaurants can help influence the best hotel and the best restaurant for our travelers and gain visibility.","It's really a very strong product for them. It's global, it's multiplatform and so we expect to see obviously continued growth for both of those products for the foreseeable future.","Thomas White - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Justin Patterson with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much, and congratulations on outperforming your Hotel margin targets. So given that performance, how do you think about the ability to get back to the high 30% to 40% Hotel margin you had prior to 2016? On one hand, you did deliver some efficiencies on OpEx this year and have some potential revenue drivers. On the other hand, those margins also exist in an era where SEO was viable and mobile was a smaller piece of the mix. So, just curious on the puts and takes there.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes, Justin, and thank you. As we look at the P&L for our Hotel business and look going forward, then we have of course, as you pointed out, this year seen significant margin improvement, mostly from advertising rationalization. But then underneath what you can start seeing Q3 is now that some of the lapping gets more visible of the beat down last year, we see nice revenue per shopper improvement.","Steve was just talking in the previous question about how we are driving more shoppers to our partners and how that is helping ultimately revenue per shopper. And there's a lot of mileage still in that. As you know and as we've said many times, we have a lot of shoppers, but relatively few of them, the minority of them, engage with our price comparison where we monetize those users the best.","And so the more we can do to become relevant for shoppers for price comparison as we are successfully doing this year, the more our revenue per shopper will go up. And for our non-pay channels, that purely drops to the bottom line. And so if we continue to be effective there, we will see an opportunity there in the future.","Steve also talked about our advertising products, which are very high margin, too.","So having said all of that, improving revenue per shopper over time will give us more opportunity to spend on marketing and over time perhaps expand our SEM and other marketing budgets again, which may dampen margin, but be very helpful to absolute EBITDA.","So those are some of the puts and takes. We look at the P&L much more from an absolute profit point of view than a margin point of view because of those choices you can make on mix between paid and non-paid channels. But we see a number of drivers that would help us move EBITDA up over the years to come.","Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from James Lee with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.","James Lee - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Thanks for taking my questions. Just want to get an update on the Bokun integration, and help us understand how quickly can you leverage this acquisition to ramp up bookable listings for your Experience business? I think we are right now about 14%. And also, last quarter you said that long term margin target is about 20%, so what kind of critical mass in terms of instant booking do you need to get to in order to get to that margin target? And lastly, can you talk about maybe some of the competitor activities in the Experience business as a number of players also ramp up in this space? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Hi, James. This is Steve. I will try to take two out of the three. Starting with the first one, we're really pleased with Bokun and what it enables us to do over the long term. We have been quite aggressive in pushing that product to the current audience and to a broader set.","The name of the game is really for us and every other attraction, OTA in the business is to get more and more of the supply online and bookable. If it comes through Bokun, if it comes through some other platform, it's all good. And Bokun in turn can distribute that inventory or we can distribute that inventory through other channels as well. Changing the consumer habit to be able to think about booking just about any experience they want on our platform before they go, and then booking \u2013 if they didn't make the decision in advance, booking the experience in-destination in our app is the endgame.","And Bokun, we are investing in it. It's not an immediate return for us in terms of revenue. It's a long term play in terms of getting lots of supply online to match with our demand. And so we work with Bokun. We work with obviously plenty of other partners in the space. Bokun's supply growth is continuing. Still so few of the total players are available and online that we see plenty of growth ahead.","And then I'll just jump to the competition and then turn it over to Ernst for the question on the finances. Of course, there is lots of players, big players, interested in tapping into what some call the last big sector in the travel space that hasn't really migrated online. Air is online, Hotel is online, but Experiences much less so. But we are in the lead, or we're one of the leaders with several other players. But the total volume of booked online versus what's currently booked offline is still really small comparatively.","To the degree that TripAdvisor and all of the competitors that also book experiences continue to grow, my view is that the pie grows, the consumer habits change, and we all benefit. I'm much more interested in changing that consumer habit. I'm much more interested in teaching people that they can book all those experiences online through us than I am worried about any particular competitor taking share in this space.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah. In terms of margins and profitability for Non-Hotel, so the fundamentals for both our Experiences business and Restaurants are quite strong. The margins are \u2013 the commission levels are good, and so the long term margin structure for this business is very healthy and can reach levels that we have seen in the Hotel business as well.","But that's over a longer period of time because we are significantly investing in making sure we grow the platform. We're in a phase right now where it is important for us to continue our leadership position, particularly in Experiences, and keep investing behind that and that's what we're doing.","So our focus is not so much on reaching the potential margin structure. In the very near term, our focus is on making sure we ramp revenue first before we seek to achieve that.","James Lee - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Okay. A quick follow-up question regarding the news feed product. And maybe, Steve, maybe you can help us understand maybe the on-boarding process from the user's perspective? Do we need to go in and sign up, put in the information about the user and create a new account there or can we leverage maybe some of the social media accounts like Facebook or Google to sign in? And the same question for connections as well. Can users bring their own social connections into play into the platform or do they need to create new ones on your platform?

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to TripAdvisor's President of Investor Relations, Mr. Will Lyons. Please go ahead.","Will Lyons - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thanks, Amanda. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our call. Joining me today are Steve Kaufer, our CEO; and our CFO, Ernst Teunissen. Last night, after market close, we distributed and filed our Q1 2018 earnings release. We made available our prepared remarks on our Investor Relations website located at ir.tripadvisor.com.","In the release, you will find reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures discussed on this call. You will also find supplemental financial information, which includes certain non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, as well as other performance metrics.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that this call may contain estimates and other forward-looking statements that represent management's views as of today, May 9, 2018. TripAdvisor disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. Please refer to our earnings release, as well as our filings with the SEC, for information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.","And now, I'll pass the call to Steve, who'll share a few thoughts before we open the call up to your questions.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thank you, Will, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our strong start to 2018. Steps we've taken to preserve near-term EBITDA are taking hold and we're progressing well on our long-term growth initiatives. We have a differentiated competitive position in the travel ecosystem with our global brand, our audience size, and the rich value proposition in the dreaming, planning, booking, in-destination and sharing phases of a trip. Our overall influence in travel continues to grow, as evidenced by our continued traffic growth and we're excited about our plans for the quarters and the years ahead.","With that brief intro, Ernst and I are ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. I have a couple if I can. For starters, it looked like a lot of the upside to revenue largely came from desktop revenue per hotel shopper. Can you talk about maybe the extent to which this was driven by self-help on the back of the redesign last year versus just an improved bidding environment and kind of what you see into 2Q?","And then secondly, on the direct marketing costs excluding TV, just wondering if you can explain how you guys were able to cut to that magnitude with such a limited impact on shopper growth? Was the spend that inefficient? Was it just the TV offset? How should we think about that growth, I guess, going forward in that direct spend ex-TV, particularly to the extent monetization improves and it changes the unit economics of some of those marketing channels? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thank you, Lloyd. This is Ernst. Good morning. Yes, indeed. The overall auction performance within our core TA Hotel business that's where your question is zooming on. We had a strong start to the year there and it was generally ahead of our expectations. And so, let's go through the different components.","On the RPS side, clearly the year-over-year performance was \u2013 on RPS was negative, mostly driven by the bid-downs we had seen much earlier in Q3 of last year. The auction stabilized into Q4, as we said on our previous call, and we saw further stabilization into Q1, in fact, into Q2. So, that was a headwind compared to the year-over-year, but not an incremental headwind to what we had seen at the back half of last year.","And so that's a negative on our year-on-year RPS performance, as is the shift to mobile. But then we saw some positive in RPS as well which is, as you call, self-help. So, we are seeing positive results from both the initiatives we've undertaken on our site, as well as the incremental performance of our TV. And so, we see some good news there as well. So, it was a give-and-take on both elements. So, we were generally very pleased with our progress there.","In terms of the reduction of sales and marketing, significant reduction of our direct online spend, but an increase of our TV spend. We spent $24 million on TV, which we didn't spend before. As you pointed out the shopper \u2013 flat shopper growth was pleasing to us in that environment. So, you see on the one hand an impact from the reduced spend on online marketing, we believe in positive impact from TV there as well. And so net-net, it worked out the way it did. But overall, we were pleased with that performance of our core hotel auction.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And if I can sneak one more, and maybe for Steve. If you look at the sponsored placement ads you guys are rolling out and like a very healthy market, for example, with a lot of hotel activity. how should we think about how many impressions per shopper you guys get and kind of click-through rates? And maybe stepping back where do you see that new ad unit in three years as a percent of hotel revenue if the product's successful?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Well, thanks Lloyd, a great question. I love talking about sponsor placements, because it is a new product for us. It's appealing to all hoteliers and all restaurateurs globally. It takes advantage of the fact that there is and always has been a lot of traffic on our site, a lot of travelers who aren't yet ready to make a purchase, but TripAdvisor is being used to influence where in fact they're going to stay. And so, for our hoteliers and restaurateurs to be able to influence where they're going to stay, where they're going to eat well prior to the purchase is a great benefit for our clients, and obviously helpful to the travelers.","You'll see sponsored placements appear on most every page, certainly, what we call list pages, I'm looking for a hotel in the city as well as in the cross-sells when I'm looking at the particular hotel and it may not be right for me, and so I want to find out something \u2013 I want to look for some different property nearby, which is a different option.","And so, all of those are good candidates for sponsored placements, and just like any ad product as we build out more clients with hoteliers, we're going to be getting much better at presenting the right hotel featured in that sponsor listing. So, the click-through rate on that hotel will go up.","So, I think it's fairly safe to say we have plenty of traffic on the site given the couple hundred million of hotel shoppers. The product is equally applicable on the phone and on desktop. So, it's not subject to kind of a headwind challenge of any shift to mobile and it's particularly valuable for our widest range of clients not just our big ones, the OTAs, but also individual properties that want to make sure that they're discovered.","In terms of modeling out where it could be in three years we, obviously, think it could be quite large. But we're just at the beginning. We just \u2013 for hotels we just launched it at the very end of last year early quarters. It's not particularly meaningful in anything right now, but I do want you to \u2013 I mean, I think you put question and I'm glad you're looking at it because it is a sign of where we think the business has wonderful growth potential, independent of kind of everything else that we're doing in the hotel category.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Patterson of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. Could you talk about the factors that drove the acceleration in the Non-Hotel segment in more detail? I could see you had some solid supply growth in there, but curious on any more detail there. And then secondly, could you talk about the factors behind the second half improvement and click based revenue? Is that simply just a function of easing comps, or are there some other operational factors you can point us to? Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. This is Steve, so I'll take the Non-Hotel drivers. So primarily as we've shared, experiences in restaurants are other bigger rolling segments of that. For experiences, we think the supply growth is awesome, and we look forward to continue. There's so many more attractions, tours, operators' experiences that can come online and take advantage of the demand that we already have, and that's a pretty important lens to view this through because as we bring on supply as we see our supply growth numbers, we're immediately able to turn that into revenue without necessarily the corresponding jump in that type of demand on the Trip site, because we already have the demand. We're just able to monetize it a lot better when we have transaction capabilities.","So, you see growth across our Viator point-of-sales, across our pure white label attractions or experience channels, and of course, the TripAdvisor engine comes along faster than almost everything else.","We're also particularly excited, obviously, not for Q1 but going forward with our latest acquisition in the space, which adds our \u2013 Vulcan, our software-as-a-service business software for tour operators and experiences to help us deliver really a better traveler experience by having more inventory available, better availability to last minute, more seamless, frictionless stability to open your phone when you're in destination and all of that the good news that can come from having some direct relationships with the operators.","Restaurants, it's more of the same, which is a good thing to be able to talk about as the improved seated diners, we continue to grow supply and kind of business is doing well in all of the markets that we're in.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","To your second question about the \u2013 so the second half in the auction versus first half and CPCs, so we will in the second half lap some of the bid downs we saw in the second half of last year. So that is going to be a favorable year-over-year comparison versus the front half of the year. Some other things to consider there too is we are pulling back on marketing, as you know, and that will continue throughout the year. So that is not necessarily a help later in the year.","And then we called out FX as well as one of the components of the year-over-year performance of the dollar against the euro, and the pound is less of a factor at the back half of the year if currencies don't change either. But you're absolutely correct in the statement that last year in Q3 we saw the most significant bid downs in our auction, and we will lap that when we get to the second half of the year.","Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Ernst.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan of Barclays. Your line is open.","Deepak Mathivanan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Congrats on a good quarter. Two questions for me. So first, revenue per hotel shopper on mobile was up 20% again in 1Q. But you are going to see some tougher comps starting in 2Q due to the improvements you made last year. Can we expect monetization improvements on mobile to continue as we go forward?","And then second question, one of your metasearch peers called out bid downs by OTAs again in 2Q. And kind of all OTAs are saying continuous efforts to improve efficiencies. However, you noted an improving trend in 2Q. Can you discuss whether you're seeing any bidding activity changes on the platform by OTAs? If not, can you maybe explain why that might be the case? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Super. Happy to take the first one, and then I'll let Ernst take the second. Yes, we've been making many quarters' worth of mobile rev per shopper improvements. And yes, we expect to continue to see that in part because all of our ongoing optimizations to improve conversion on the site are either led by mobile or a mobile experience as part of the initial release. So, we have teams that we have for a while that work on improvements, and those obviously get rolled out on all of our platforms. We fully expect that to continue.","I will point out, sort of part two of that is more travelers are getting used to buying more things on their phone, independent of TripAdvisor's action, that tendency to book means there's more qualified traffic on that device. More qualified traffic means more downstream bookings for our clients, which means they're able to pay more for the traffic. So, I would expect that to just be an ongoing secular tailwind for us in the category, leading me to my confidence that our continued \u2013 our RPS will continue to go up on the phone.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And Deepak, to your second question about the behavior in our core hotel auction, as we said in our prepared remarks, we saw a real stability in our auction environment in Q1. We saw the stability starting in Q4 as we had called out three months ago. We saw a continuation of that in Q1. We saw a continuation of that into Q2. So we saw the environment as largely stable.","We continue to work on making our traffic as attractive as possible for our partners through the experience for our users on our site by continuing to focus on the downstream impact that the traffic has for our partners, and we will continue to work on that throughout the year as it comes. But stability was basically what we have seen really since Q4.","Deepak Mathivanan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Ernst.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey, good morning. I have one question on Non-Hotel. That segment's becoming more material than I think many people realize, and it looks like it's probably going to be 25% to 30% of revenue this year. And you talked about in the past mid-20s growth. Do you still feel that's the case over the next few quarters? And then, what are you seeing from a competitive standpoint for experiences in restaurants in the markets that you're operating? And then lastly, what could the long-term margins of that business look like? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes. So Non-Hotel growth was strongest this quarter, a strong performance. It's really a continuation of many of the trends in our restaurant and experience businesses, in particular, that we have seen throughout. There's a bit of a mix shift going on of course towards those faster growing parts of the Non-Hotel segment, attractions and restaurants.","But our outlook for the year remains as it was before. It's robust continued growth there that is going to, in our view, be similar to what we've seen in quarters past and last year. And so good performance, good start to the year, and looking forward to continued growth there.","In terms of the long-term margin profile, all of those businesses have attractive margin profiles. They have good take rates. They have cost structures that are very scalable, and we've seen some of that scalability of the cost structure really come through in margin over the last 18 months.","And so, we are confident that we can reach high margins there. We said in the past that, for the whole business over the long term we expect to go to mid-to-high 20s% EBITDA margins and these Non-Hotel businesses are going to be a significant contributor to that. So, we see the most very healthy P&Ls.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And then from a competitive perspective, I think our biggest competitor is simply the travelers saying I'm going to buy it when I get there. I'm going to call up, to make a reservation. It's just the lack of awareness that I can and should buy these experiences online. And I think we have tremendous tailwinds to, just as hotels experience decades for us to go. Well, of course, it's now natural to find what you're looking for to shop around, get the best price, and the best experience online. And we happen to have \u2013 TripAdvisor Media Group happens to have a huge amount of demand that people doing that now. And then going offline to book, because we didn't have the booking capabilities. So, again, it's tapping into the demand that we have. And while we certainly have competitors, who are selling experiences online, it's much left, us versus them, in my view than growing the total size of the pie that we've been \u2013 that is booked online that's the huge opportunity over the next several years.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Two questions please. You talked about increasing your attractions inventory. I think there was something like 80% growth. Could you be \u2013 could you provide some details on what inventory specifically is rising, in particular types of attractions or experiences inventory that's growing faster than others? And then, in terms of the outlook for the year, what would it take to have the Hotel segment revenue actually grow in 2018? What would have to change in the back half of the year in order for that to actually flip and actually start growing again? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Mark. I'll take the first and Ernst, will take the second. On inventory types that, we're really benefiting from the marketplace. So, we have a great view into where the demand is for travelers on TripAdvisor, specifically, and so we target our sales reps, our account managers to go fill that demand as much as possible with the opportunity to book the experience in advance. A lot of the growth is coming from the growing awareness of TripAdvisor as and Viator is a big alternative demand channel for the owners. So, they're simply coming in and signing up. So, we have a whole bunch of tech investments under the covers that are all around making that process to get more supply and continue that level of 80+% growth rate for many years to come, because there's so much out there, because we have the demand and because we always believe in providing the most choice possible for our travelers.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And to your second part of the question, Mark. In terms of levers in the Hotel business and so looking towards the back half of the year, so the things that we are working on internally are the improvements to our site to the overall experience for our users on the hotel and thereby the improvement for our partners of our traffic. We have a number of initiatives that we're rolling out. We've talked about some of them in this quarter both on the desktop and the mobile side and we'll continue to work on that and expecting to see continued progress.","On the TV side, so we're investing more this year than last year $100 million to $130 million. We are seeing nice traction on TV. So, it's still not a ROI positive spend in quarter, but we see the improvements to the returns there and we're hopeful that we can continue to see that and confident that we can get that to the long-term profitability. So, we're looking at that and the success of those campaigns and our ability to tweak those as we go forward. So, those are some of the biggest drivers that we are focused on internally and continue to work on and to the extent that we're successful there will impact our success in the back half on revenue.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you, Ernst. Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kevin Kopelman of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks. I had a question on attractions. Can you talk more about the bookings trends, and what kind of growth are you seeing in attractions bookings, and has that also accelerated as you accelerated supply? And then can you also talk more specifically about how the Bokun deal will be integrated and benefit the attractions business? And will that deal have any impact on the financials this year? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","So, on the first question. Yes. We saw \u2013 to start at the high level in Non-Hotel, impressive overall growth in our Non-Hotel segment 36% and as you can imagine, our experiences business being a large part of that business being a very important contributor to that. So that kind of revenue growth is created by continued bookings growth as well. So, we saw continued nice performance on bookings, and particularly which is something, we're excited about internally. The growth on our TA side is very impressive and ahead of the kind of revenue growth \u2013 overall revenue growth for Non-Hotel would imply significantly ahead of that.","And so that's exciting to us because that ultimately strategically for us long-term that platform, the TA platform is the most scalable platform for us in our experiences business. We have so many users already on our experiences pages on TA and able to continue penetration there, continue conversion there, is a huge opportunity for us and also economically a very attractive opportunity because we have so much traffic already on our site that we don't have to additionally acquire. Steve, do you want to tackle the Bokun question?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah. So with this new company, we're able to help bring a lot more inventory online because so many of the experience companies still aren't \u2013 still don't have any software that helps them run their business that can also deliver the online bookability. So, point one for Bokun is it's a great company. We welcome them all into the fold.","Point two, the software that they have really should be and we're making available globally to bring the inventory online so that travelers on trip, or on the Viator, on our third-party channels can find it and book it. And that's just a win-win all around. And with the Bokun part of the family, we are able to make that easily done for attraction owners. Make it very affordable for attraction owners. And that, obviously, helps our entire ecosystem. 2018 financial impact, Ernst, do you want to comment on meaningfulness of it?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes, don't expect to too big an impact on the financials this year of Bokun, it's an acquisition that we're going to integrate and then accelerate organically. And it's not going to be material to our numbers for this year.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then a quick follow-up. Does it make sense to start talking about attractions on the TV ads? And then when do you expect to see ad spend for Non-Hotel start to grow again? Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","So, that's a great question. I want to tip my hat \u2013 tip my hat \u2013 tip my hands on when we would be doing that. But I will reiterate that part of our differentiation and part of the awareness of TripAdvisor in the travel ecosystem is the fact that we have much more than just hotels.","To be clear, we love hotels and we expect that to return to the top-line growth. And we're showing great progress in the system there. But part of all of TripAdvisor is helping you on the entire trip and we want to make sure everyone knows about that. And so, one should reasonably assume that we will grow our marketing of attractions and other things in ways that work for our other businesses, such as TV. So, I'm not giving you a particular timeframe but certainly setting the expectation that it's more a matter of when not if.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Ernst.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Dae K. Lee - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. This is Dae Lee on for Doug. First question, how do you plan to balance the message around best price, with your value proposition and user reviews as you ramp your brand campaign? And could you share any early feedbacks in new markets you've entered and what you're seeing there? And as a follow-up, could you provide more details around what you are doing to building more holistic end-user experience that you mentioned on the letter?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. So, we have tremendous brand awareness in almost every country around the world on the topic of reviews, of trusted community, always use TripAdvisor to plan the trip. But a surprising number of people didn't understand that we also have one of the best price comparison engines out there.","So if you're looking not only for the best hotel but that hotel at the best price, if you're looking to compare, you know, do your own individual trade-offs between, well, am I willing to spend an extra $10 for a slightly better hotel or not? TripAdvisor is the perfect place to do it.","And that message is the core message that we're running our TV ads with. And it's working. We're driving increased price awareness of TripAdvisor is a place to find the best price to compare your deals. And as you know, we did that last year. We've seen our positive results. We've increased our spend. So that piece of the strategy is working, and we've found no indications or we haven't seen any indications that it's hurting our brand or consumer awareness as the trusted review site that we started at. I'm not saying that that'll be the only message going forward, but I'm certainly saying it's working for us now.","Details on the holistic end-to-end user experience. Well, if you think about what TripAdvisor offers today to so many people, they might come in starting their travel plan with a flight search, move to a hotel search, think about what they want to do in destination, and of course, they need to eat. And some of that is during the trip, some of that is well in advance, some of it is armchair traveling. We have so many users that of course, it's touching all segments.","The end-to-end experience that we talked about you see in some of our travel planning tools that are on the site now. And then we really want to highlight so that \u2013 and this is an ongoing kind of work stream. It's been ongoing, it will continue, because it's a core differentiated feature of TripAdvisor that you can do all of this planning, and it's really hard\/impossible to do that anywhere else.","So we have a business unit that we call Core Experience dedicated to providing the common user experience across everything on the TripAdvisor point-of-sale and then working on some of the newer functionality that we haven't launched yet, we haven't talked about yet, that will kind of help drive an experience that, as we say internally, is more than the sum of the individual shopping experience, it's more than the sum of the parts. But I'll have to keep you in suspense on that for a bit longer.","Dae K. Lee - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan of SunTrust. Your line is open.","Naved Khan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. Hi. Thanks a lot. Can you give us a sense of the magnitude of contribution you're getting from the sponsored products? And just to clarify, is this revenue stream showing up under the display line, or is it a part of other lines as well? And then, on GDPR, can you sort of give us your commentary on what we should expect, if at all, in terms of impact from the rollout of this regulation in Europe?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Hi, Naved. I'll take the first part of the question. It is \u2013 the sponsor placements are part of the line, revenue line called display and subscriptions, so that second revenue line within our Hotel segment. It is not particularly material. It was a contributor to the growth in that revenue line in this quarter year-over-year. But it's not, in the grand scheme of things, not a large part of our revenue yet.","We have, as Steve was talking before, we have ambitious plans for the long-term. So it will become more and more meaningful as we progress, but in our Q1 results, not a particularly material number.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And then the GDPR, we've obviously, like most companies, been aware of it for a quite some time, so we don't expect a meaningful impact on our business at this point.","Naved Khan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you, Ernst. Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Brad Erickson of KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Brad Erickson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Just a couple follow-ups. So the ad spending optimization is clearly having a nice impact on the bottom line. How do you balance that relative to the shopper growth? Or I guess to ask it a little differently, is it safe to say that sustainable hotel shopper growth is absolutely contemplated in your revenue target of double-digit growth? And, I guess, do you think some of the product enhancements can allow for that, even if you throttle ad spend to some degree and shopper growth remains a little bit relatively more depressed?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah. So, I do think returning to hotel shopper growth is in the cards. Again, we've throttled some of our performance spend, which helps us drive better quality traffic to the site and therefore, kind of more downstream bookings, the core thing that we care the most about. But we've also ramped up our television spend. Why? Because that will drive more shoppers and more qualified shoppers to the site. So, I still reiterate we're certainly looking for growth in hotel shoppers and overall hotel revenue as we've done our changes.","The things I was referring to a few moments ago with the Core Ex business unit and some of the improvements that are coming obviously aim to build out a more complete travel experience, which in turn get more people engaged in the funnel, drives more membership, which drives more overall usage of our product. That by definition helps grow hotel shoppers. As large as we are, we feel there's still plenty of room to have more people trying to use TripAdvisor to plan their trip.","Brad Erickson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then, I think you've been getting some downstream data for a while from some of your customers. Can you just kind of talk about how you're utilizing that and what changes you've made as a result of seeing that data, is that have anything to do with some of this performance to ad optimization? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes, insightful question. So, we have been receiving performance data and to be clear, it's just the signal from our partners that says \u2013 many of our partners not all, that the clicks that we send downstream have turned into bookings on their side, because all of our clients are looking to sell that hotel room. And it's less about raw traffic to them as bookings that we drive, as they give us the signal that says, hey click A is more valuable than click B. We can in turn change our traffic acquisition mix and our on-site behavior of how we're pulling travelers to the shopping experience to make sure they're more qualified.","I'll give you a very simple example of the latter. It's relatively easy for us on our side if we wanted to just say essentially click here to partner A, click here to partner B, very much, very loud without first helping the traveler understand whether this is the right hotel for them.","We generate more clicks, which in the old model would have generated more revenue for us, but it wasn't necessarily generating more bookings. And so, by making sure the traveler on our site is more qualified. They understand what they're looking to purchase before we send them over to our client site. That increases the bookings, and of course if our bookings increase on the client side, our CPCs hold will go up.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And to connect the dot with the marketing spend, so what that means if we have better insight into the downstream booking performance, we found that some of our marketing spend that looked good from an ROS perspective, on a click-based looked less good on a downstream booking behavior and that is the kind of spend that we're addressing in the reduction of marketing spend, which is an improvement for profitability and a lesser \u2013 it is a pressure on revenue and pressure on the number of bookings, but particularly on profitability, it's a bit positive.","Brad Erickson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. That's great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Robert James Coolbrith - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. This is Rob on the call for Peter. On vacation rentals, wondering if you give a sense of how that business is doing, maybe how fast Non-Hotel is growing, excluding vacation rentals at this point?","And then also a follow-up on core experience. I was just wondering, if there's been a benefit there already. Is there anything that you're testing, and if so, what kind of lift are you seeing in cross-sell or product attach rates, or wherever the relevant metrics may be? Thank you.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","I'll start with the first part of the question on the rentals business. The rentals business is a stable business for us. It is not one of the drivers of growth in Non-Hotel, that's really driven by our experiences and our restaurant business. It's a good business for us with good margins.","We benefit not only from the various brands that we have in rentals, but we benefit from making all that supply available on our TripAdvisor site as well, so it's a good business for us. But as we think strategically about which areas of the business we are investing to grow, it is focused on our restaurants and experiences business.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And then when we kind of look at some of the Core Ex improvements, again, some of it is just very foundational. You'd have to look carefully to see it on the site. It's like becoming more consistent across all of our different verticals. Some of it is just \u2013 we're putting a smarter cross-sell or smarter offer in front of a user when a hotel doesn't have availability. We don't want to lose them, so let's make some other recommendations and let's make them better recommendations, and we see meaningful wins there.","I'd paint it as they're all relatively small individual wins that happen several times a month, and they just add up over the course of the year. And that's part of what we call our revenue optimization and our site optimization.","And it's across, again, the site, the app, our CRM, our emails, our notifications, all the things that we have with respect to a traveler who's on a journey and making sure we're sending them the right message at the right time given that we're more than a one product company.","Robert James Coolbrith - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Lee of Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.","James Lee - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Is it fair to say that the improvement in RPS is also due to your performance advertising optimization strategy where you're focusing more on retargeting as opposed to prospecting? And also, maybe at what point would you start focusing on prospecting as you start \u2013 maybe potentially start growing hotel shoppers? Or is the TV advertising the way you prefer to do it? And lastly for TV advertising ramping up, how should we think about the new market you will be investing this year? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. I'll try to hit all of those. So, of course, retargeting is a part of our performance-based advertising, but it's been that way for a while. So, I'd say the \u2013 there is RPS improvement because we're looking closer at the downstream bookings signal versus the straight click count when we're buying our advertising, as Ernst was talking about. But I wouldn't say retargeting was a much bigger or a much smaller component than it has been.","The TV ramping in our new markets, because we saw success when we launched last year in our top six, we're obviously continuing and spending more there but also expanding into an additional set of markets, and we expect a similar growth curve in terms of the TV return on ad spend. So the curves are all what you'd expect. The newer markets will take a little longer to build. And right now, we're receiving some of the benefit of having started the TV almost a year ago now.","James Lee - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Steve, can you also talk about the most important benefit on the Bokun acquisition? Does it allow you to increase your instant bookable attraction listings a lot faster than you would have otherwise do it yourself? I'm just curious if that would be one of the major benefit in terms of ramping up the success and help you to drive more bookings on attractions specifically? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Well I think of it as just one of the things \u2013 one of the many things that we're doing to invest heavily in our Experiences business unit. So, we're making kind of onboarding supply from any partner, direct from the attraction or through any other aggregator, much easier. That's an initiative. We've got our international initiatives, making sure that our tours and attractions can be booked in as many languages as possible. We have our ongoing conversion optimizations both on TripAdvisor and on Viator to help make the \u2013 to help the traveler find what they're looking for faster and easier and book it.","And then we have the longer-term supply initiative of enabling through Bokun thousands of additional suppliers who will eventually go online, but through this technology can ideally go online a lot sooner. And of course, if they're going online, it's helping them fill their tours and it helps TripAdvisor monetize those great experiences, and the consumer wins because whether you're booking in advance or in-destination, they have that level of convenience. And so again, there's a number of players in that particular space helping attractions go online and we feel we can accelerate that overall trend, which will help us and help everyone else in the attractions category.","James Lee - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just two. How should we expect the Non-Hotel direct marketing to grow this year versus revenue? And then as experiences becomes a larger percentage of Non-Hotel, should we expect similar seasonality patterns, or how should we view seasonality in the Non-Hotel segment?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah. So, our marketing in Non-Hotel is increasing. It's significantly higher than last year, and not a significant break with how we approached marketing for Non-Hotel last year. So not much to call out there in terms of a difference of this year versus last year. In terms of seasonality, so Non-Hotel is a more seasonal business than our Hotel business, so you have seen that in past years, which is, impacts both the revenue, but particularly the profit profile of the business. It is a more \u2013 it's a little bit more seasonal, driven by our vacation rental business in particular, but also our attractions businesses is seasonal. The restaurant business itself is a little bit seasonal, but not as much as the other two businesses.","Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May of Citi. Your line is open.","Zachary Morrissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. This is Zach actually on for Mark. Two questions. Just could you talk about your plans for further investments in the attractions space? Obviously, Bokun last month. But I guess, kind of, what opportunities are you seeing there? And then secondly, it appears that some of the larger OTAs are continuing to rationalize their online direct marketing spend. I guess, do you have a sense of, kind of, when that will start to stabilize? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you, Zach. In terms of the areas where we invest on the experiences side, the attractions side, you saw the graph in our prepared remarks about our bookable supply. So, there's a big focus on making sure that more and more supply is bookable on our site. Both, the Viator site, but particularly also the TripAdvisor site. So that's a big focus area, making sure we have more and more supply to put in front of the large audience that we have already.","We have incremental investments this year around our international, non-english speaking sites, making sure that we have more revenue coming from non-english speaking sites, which is where our business still skews and where we see a big opportunity going forward. Obviously, continuing to make investment in the underlying product and in our marketing into it as well. And Bokun is another example of opening up a new area there.","So, there's plenty to invest in on the experience side. As we've said before, the fact that we've improved our margins in Non-Hotel is not a reflection of us holding back on investing on the experiences side. We are going full speed ahead. And the business is fully focused on driving revenue growth for the long term. And so that's where our focus is.","Then shifting \u2013 your question then shifting to our Hotel business and particularly to our core auction business again, in terms of OTA behavior and rationalizing performance spend. As we've said, in previous quarters, yes, we did see some of that in the back half of last year. As we said on this call and in our prepared remarks, we saw stabilization that happened in Q4. We saw further stabilization into this quarter and into Q2. So not much more to report from our end on that front.","Zachary Morrissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Brian Fitzgerald of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, guys. Revenue per hotel shopper continues to improve nicely, but there still remains a fundamental gap there. There's reasons why any dynamic to call out with respect to kind of convergence or closure of that gap? Or maybe, how big was a gap a year ago relative to today? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah. So, I assume you're particularly referring to the gap desktop to mobile. And we have been closing that gap. So, we called out the 20%-plus RPS improvement on mobile this quarter year-over-year, where desktop, clearly, was down. And so, we are narrowing the gap. The gap over the last year or so had narrowed by about 10 points.","So, we are now closer to the 40% monetization of mobile to desktop, and a year ago we were close to 30%. And so that number is ticking up every time, and we continue to work hard on making sure that gap narrows, as the gap narrows, obviously, the impact that the shift to mobile has on our RPS starts to abate, and that is an important economic part of our model.","So, as we look forward into this year and beyond, we're looking at lapping the \u2013 the bid-downs very important point at the second \u2013 at the back half of the year and then the crossover point at some point where the mobile shift is actually not going to be as much of a headwind as it has been in the past. And so, we are very focused on that, you've seen the improvement that we made on the mobile side. We continue to make improvements there and see some runway ahead of us.","Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks, Ernst.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.

Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to TripAdvisor\u2019s fourth quarter and year end 2012 earnings conference call. I am Will Lyons, Senior Director of Investor Relations for TripAdvisor. And joining me on the call today are our CEO, Steve Kaufer; and our CFO, Julie Bradley.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that the estimates and other forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company\u2019s views as of today, February 13, 2013. TripAdvisor disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.

Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and technology and content expense excludes stock-based compensation and all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period in 2011.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Kaufer","Thank you, Will and welcome everyone. The fourth quarter closed out a great 2012, a year in which we made wonderful progress along our growth initiatives. We grow strong member and content collection across our increasingly global footprint. We invested in our social and mobile offerings to enhance brand awareness. We laid the foundation for growth in our business listings and vacation rentals products and we continue to innovate the TripAdvisor platform for our users and customers alike.","For the quarter as expected, revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth accelerated growing 23% and 17% respectively. TripAdvisor hotel shoppers grew in the mid 30s driving 24% click-based revenue growth. For the year, over 30% hotel shopper growth drove 20% total revenue growth, 18% click-based revenue growth, and 9% adjusted EBITDA growth. Strong results in light of substantial revenue headwinds and our ongoing commitment to invest for the long-term. Julie will discuss our financials and outlook in more detail shortly.","On the consumer side, we are pleased to see continued strong traffic growth around the globe. Specifically according to our logs, total monthly unique visitors to TripAdvisor branded sites grew approximately 45% in the fourth quarter with Asia-Pacific leading the way at over 75% growth. Over 60% of our traffic originates from outside of the core U.S. and UK markets. In the 2013, we are focused on enhancing the TripAdvisor brands in these markets amassing more local language content to drive more user growth engagement.","While we continue to grow hotel shoppers fastest in newer international markets, we are also seeing healthy growth in the U.S. and UK despite their relative maturity showing that there is headroom even in our most established markets. As it relates to our social initiatives, according to app data, TripAdvisor\u2019s Facebook app reached the number one spot in terms of monthly active users in late Q4 and was the only travel app in the top 20. During the year, we more than doubled our members acquired through Facebook helping us grow marketable members nearly 100% year-over-year to 44 million. Currently, 35% of our new reviews are coming from Facebook connected members and we are rapidly closing in on our 100 million reviews and opinions milestone.","Rich user-generated content is the lifeblood of our business and our travel community is on pace to adding more than 30 million contributions in 2013. In January, we e-mailed all 2012 contributors thanking them for their reviews, the photos, the room tips, the forum posts, all the things that make our site better and better everyday, leveraging social and community remain a key piece of our membership and brand growth strategy.","As it relates to our mobile initiatives, we greatly improved our smartphone user interface by rolling \u2013 by user experience by rolling a new meta-display to all smartphone traffic in Q4. We doubled our smartphone and tablet app downloads to more than 31 million and our 45 million average monthly mobile uniques in Q4 was up 190% year-over-year according to our log files. Additionally, we launched 20 news free City Guides across iOS and Android bringing our coverage to 80 cities.","To give you better sense for the mobile growth, we are experiencing over the past year TripAdvisor phone and tablet traffic have each doubled, each now accounting for approximately 10% to 15% of our sessions. Smartphones currently account for less than 5% of our click-based revenues, whereas tablet now accounts for approximately 10% to 15% of revenues. We don\u2019t expect the phones monetization rate to improve materially in 2013, but we are okay with that given that it\u2019s more of an in-market tool for travelers. We anticipate continued traffic in revenue growth on mobile devices in 2013 and enhancing our mobile presence remains a top strategic priority.","Shifting gears on the partners\u2019 side, we have been providing rank reports to test clients and bid recommendation reports to a broader set of clients and we are working on adding functionality that will allow them to update their bids more frequently. On the whole, we are pleased with the progress we have made migrating the bidding platform to a more transparent dynamic system that makes it easier for partners to spend more on TripAdvisor.","We have entered 2013 with great momentum from all of these initiatives and true to our speed wins philosophy, we are innovating quickly to build the best experience for every user on every device, in every geographies. To that end, on the heels of a full meta rollout to smartphone traffic in Q4, we have begun integrating our meta display in 12 tablet and desktop sessions. We believe that pairing meta search capabilities with our best-in-class user generated content provides a superior user experience. Hotel shoppers can price compare without leaving TripAdvisor resulting in higher quality leads for partners.","Barring unforeseen circumstances, we expect to complete this transition in the next three to six months and despite revenue headwinds in the first half, we are cautiously optimistic that this change once complete will end up being revenue neutral to TripAdvisor monetization. It goes without saying that, that is an important and exciting change for our business. Now to be clear, with 45% Q4 traffic growth and mid 30s hotel shopper growth, the business is obviously in great shape even in our world of large numbers.","But with our new price shopping value proposition, we feel the time is now right to be even more aggressive and begin a global offline marketing campaign, which we expect to kickoff sometime in Q3. Complementing TripAdvisor\u2019s permanent branding campaign, the awards, the certificates, stickers, badges that many of you see in hotels and restaurants and attractions and travel websites all around the globe. A meaningful offline marketing campaign can showcase TripAdvisor\u2019s value and help build a more far reaching indispensable travel brand. We will approach this offline campaign with the same iterative test and learn process as we do with our other major initiatives as we look to measure and quantify the results in each market.","Also the outlook that Julie will describe shortly does not contemplate a meaningful lift in repeat visits or traffic from the offline spend, so that could provide some upside from a traffic and revenue standpoint. In light of this new branding investment, we are forecasting net expenses will grow faster than our revenue this year. This is squarely aligned with our stated objective to prioritize long-term revenue growth over expanding profit margins.","In summary, the fourth quarter capped a great 2012, and I want to extend a special thanks to all of the TripAdvisor Inc. employees around the globe who set the stage for an even better 2013. Before I close, I would also like to extend a thank you to Barry Diller, where his leadership as Chairman over the years and formally welcome our new Chairman, Greg Maffei. Liberty has participated on our board since the spin-off and the management team and I look forward to further deepening that relationship.","I will now turn the call over to Julie who will provide some color on the Q4 results as well as our financial outlook.","Julie Bradley","Thanks, Steve and good afternoon everyone. Driven by strong hotel shopper growth in our click-based business, Q4 came in a little better than we had expected with revenue and profit growth accelerating to 23% and 17% respectively assuming constant currency revenue would have been 1% higher. Our Q4 click-based revenue was at 24%. When comparing to hotel shopper growth in the mid 30s lower year-on-year pricing from Expedia and other partners due to macro weakness and FX is the main driver of why click-based revenue did not track closer to hotel shopper growth. Additional factors also include increasing international and phone traffic, our meta rollout on smartphones plus impacts from Hurricane Sandy, all of which are much harder to quantify independently.","More importantly, 2013 has gotten off to a great start. We are seeing strong hotel shopper growth and better year-on-year pricing. We believe that is at least partially due to an improving European landscape and higher quality traffic. As it relates to geographic mix, non-U.S. revenue was 50% of total revenue during the quarter, which was consistent with Q3 and up slightly from 48% in the fourth quarter of 2011. As a housekeeping note, starting on our Q1 2013 earnings report, we will disclose geographic revenue breakout by regions, North America, EMEA, LatAm, and APAC, which is more consistent with how we measured the business internally as suppose to U.S., U.K., and rest of world. Of course, we also provide historical quarterly information on our metric sheet back to 2010.","While year-over-year click-based comps eased in Q4, the opposite was true for our display business. Display-based revenue was down 3% year-over-year due to a tough Q4 2011 comp driven by a large buy that did not reoccur. However, due to our continued geographical diversification for this product, we are forecasting the business to return to year-over-year growth in 2013. Subscription transaction and other revenue which includes business listings, vacation rentals, and our transaction businesses had a good Q4 growing 56%. In business listings, we closed 2012 with more than 50,000 subscribers up from more than 40% year-over-year and have a strong global sales force in sales to drive growth in 2013.","On the vacation rental side, we saw listing and inquiries accelerate in the back half of the year, driven by increased visitor demand and healthy renewal rate. Travelers can now research more than 300,000 properties in more than 160 countries. We have also launched a couple of payment systems to promote a more satisfying and frictionless booking process. Our fast growing global traffic brings the unique value proposition to property owners and in 2013 we will continue to expand our service offerings in these areas.","As expected, overall expenses for the quarter increased as a percent of revenue primarily due to how revenue seasonality impacts our largely fixed cost structure. As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to increase direct marketing cost in Q4 and in effort to diversify traffic, expand internationally and few user engagements through social network. These remain important 2013 initiatives for us as well as giving to invest in a traditional offline marketing campaign. For full year 2012, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and CapEx each came in just under 4% of revenue. Stock-based compensation was higher than expected this past quarter due to accelerated vesting for certain directors\u2019 equity pursuant to change in control provision.","For 2013, we expect depreciation, amortization, and CapEx to be consistent with 2012 and stock-based compensation expenses to increase slightly, to approximately 6% of revenue. Moving on to taxes, our Q4 GAAP effective tax rate was 31% slightly lower than Q3 primarily due to geographic mix favoring lower foreign tax jurisdictions, and an international reorganization completed during Q4 that further helps the foreign tax rate differential. We expect our 2013 effective tax rate to be in the mid to high 20s reflecting a full year\u2019s worth of benefit from the international reorganization.","With that, let me share some thoughts on 2013\u2019s outlook. 2012 faced several revenue headwinds namely the site redesigns, spin-related changes in Expedia pricing and SEM changes. In terms of year-over-year revenue growth, 2012 headwinds abate which we are seeing today in terms of on-site conversion and pricing. However, we do have a potential revenue headwind in 2013 although we believe the meta transition will end up being roughly revenue neutral once complete. There most likely will be a modest near-term impact. We have assumed that the transition is mostly complete in the first half of 2013 and that for the full year, total revenue growth and click-based revenue growth will be in the low 20s. Our forecast for click-based revenue assumes continued hotel shopper growth and robust partner participation in our meta auction.","In addition to the near-term impact of meta, other potential revenue headwinds include a mix shift towards international markets and faster hotel shopper growth on smartphones, where we are seeing lower CPC pricing. Remember, hotel shopper growth can fluctuate widely in a relatively short span of time making it very difficult to predict, but we believe that it should remain strong given our growth plans and marketing initiatives.","On the pricing side, there will be some volatility in the first half of the year as partners realign their bids to match the better conversions they are seeing from our meta offerings. To facilitate a smooth transition for us and our clients, we are allowing our clients to bid separately for smartphone traffic, the new desktop meta traffic as well as our traditional desktop traffic. Conversion rates on our partner sites differ dramatically between these three types of leads. And so we believe it makes sense to allow our clients to bid separately for each type. We expect display-based growth in the high single digits as macroeconomic concerns weigh on discretionary ad spend and as we experiment with new ad products. We also expect full year subscription, transaction, and other revenue growth in the low 50s driven by investment in our vacation business \u2013 vacation rentals business and sales force productivity gains in business listings.","On the expense side, due to our ongoing investment in traffic acquisition and diversification, social initiatives as well as the introduction of an offline marketing campaign, we expect to see de-leverage on the sales and marketing line throughout the year, particularly in the back half. We expect sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue to look grants from mid 30s to low to mid 40s as a percent of revenue throughout the year. We expect tech and content will de-lever slightly throughout the year as we continue to acquire talent to pursue our technology initiative.","And G&A as a percent of revenue should remain fairly consistent with 2012 levels and show some slight leverage for the full year. As a result, we expect high single-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in 2013 and expect higher margins in the first half of the year than the second half due to the planned timing of our offline marketing campaigns. Absent the offline marketing campaign, we believe full year adjusted EBITDA growth would have grown in line with our expected 2013 revenue growth of low 20. In summary, TripAdvisor had a great 2012 and we have exciting plans for continued growth in 2013.","We\u2019ll now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. Wondering if you can just talk a little about the shift to meta search and meta display and mechanically how you expect that to work? Is it still going to be primarily CPC-based revenue model or will there also be some rev sharing? And then as you think about kind of effective take rates in that model, is there any reason why you don\u2019t think they could they could go up as you are delivering more qualified leads to clients as opposed to the neutralish guidance you talked about?","Steve Kaufer","Sure. Excellent question on the minds of many, I am sure. So, we expect to remain in a mostly CPC cost per click-based environment. We are certainly open and with some clients will have some component of the traffic team paid for on a rev share basis when it makes sense for them and when it makes sense for us. At the end of the day, we believe we have the tremendous number of hotel shoppers coming into the top of our funnel and nothing \u2013 and meta really doesn\u2019t change any of that. So, what it does is it enables that visitor to do a bunch of price shopping while staying on TripAdvisor, which in fact doesn\u2019t generate any click or any revenue event for us. But when the clients or when the traveler does in fact click over to a client they are qualified by the hotels they were looking at being available and at being a price that they can afford.","We have had years of experience with this in our price product, which has been meta for many, many years. There is no doubt in our mind because we have seen the data from many clients that the downstream conversion of these travelers as they land on our client sites, they are much more ready to book. So, the question in our mind truly comes down to we know we will generate fewer clicks from our website to our clients. We know that those leads will convert at a much higher rate if in fact those two numbers balance, for instance, if we send a third list leads that convert at 3X the number of 3X the conversion rate on the part of the client\u2019s site, then we are even assuming neutral pricing, i.e., price goes up 3X, because our clients get 3X the benefit. Our clients always have measured us on how many bookings we have actually delivered. So, if the higher quality leads delivers the same number of bookings, it works for all parties.","Finally, we talked a little bit about our caution in the transition, because it\u2019s very natural and we have started to roll it out to send these new leads over, they are much higher qualified and clients are clearly as evidenced in our test willing to pay much more for them. But to be fair, they need to have some time to measure that the conversion is in fact 3X or 4X or whatever the numbers might be in order to justify it themselves that it\u2019s worth paying that much more for the leads. And then of course our system is an auction one. So, we are not dictating the prices to our clients. They are bidding up the prices and to bid up in an auction depends upon how many people are interested in those leads. So, we need the full auction dynamics to be in effect. From our test environment from the percentage of traffic that we have given on desktop and combined with our months of experience on mobile, we see it happening and we expect it to come to a very positive fruition at the end of the day positive or negative we just don\u2019t know yet.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank","And as a follow-up I was just thinking is there a way you can help us quantify the opportunity from the improved user experience around meta to close the gap between hotel shoppers and unique users. So, in other words, as the experience improves what kind of percent of your traffic is actively already hotel shoppers that could perhaps and versus the percent that\u2019s not they could be converted into hotel shoppers from the better user experience, is there any kind of color you could provide there?","Steve Kaufer","I am not sure I\u2019d look at it that way. In general terms, I can give you the guidance that you can think of about half of TripAdvisor\u2019s traffic is in hotel shopping mode and half is doing other stuff, it varies. I mean, there is lot of puts and takes there, but it\u2019s a ballpark number you can hang on to. While we think hotel, while we think meta will absolutely increase the number of people that enjoy the experience of hotel shopping and therefore tell their friends and come back and use TripAdvisor as the first place they go to plan that trip, I am not convinced or rather we didn\u2019t build meta in order to get folks who are looking at restaurants or attractions over into hotel shopping funnel. We have a lot of personalization efforts, we have a lot of cross sales obviously we do a lot with all the traffic that comes to the site, but if you\u2019re looking for a restaurant fundamentally there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to get you interested in hotel, no matter what the commerce technology is.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Nat Schindler of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Nat Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, thank you. You mentioned that less than 5% of your click-based revenue comes from smartphones. But as I understanding wasn\u2019t at all monetized prior to meta so with the launch of meta all of that revenue is from smartphones this quarter and all incremental the Q4 results.","Steve Kaufer","No, we actually had what we call our classic version on the phones, where you entered your dates for the hotel and we would show you the logos of our providers and you\u2019d click on a logo and you\u2019d open up another webpage land on that site, it was just an incredibly painful experience on that very small screen real-estate. So, shifting that experience to the phone was it actually that\u2019s my recollection revenue negative at that point, but we didn\u2019t feel it was a true reflection of desktop again because the experience was particularly painful on the phone. So, we think of that is just more of a better conversion and I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 that the growth in mobile was truly growth in traffic base as suppose to the meta switch over.","Nat Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, and one more question on meta, when we last spoke about meta, you would discuss it being launched on the desktop throughout all of 2013 largely the minimized the risk of revenue hit. Is there any \u2013 is this sounds like you have sped up the timetable on this. Is there a reason why you have and what you have been seen from your initial test that kind of drove you to do that.","Steve Kaufer","I\u2019m sure, I\u2019ve never talked about it specific timeframe we had said earlier that we began testing meta and as we tested certainly, we feel the experience is significantly better. We\u2019ve gotten our clients on board with the new bidding models that the new pricing and we\u2019ve seen the benefits of the conversion. So, it\u2019s really about that user experience that has gone so well and in fact that the technology is in place now that is \u2013 I guess you could say we\u2019ve been able to speeded up, but I think we\u2019ve always been interested in releasing at as soon as we can. The ongoing open question mark on the timeframe is in part making sure our technology and scale and the part making sure our plans have enough time to adjust their processes for buying traffic on TripAdvisor to this new model.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Mahaney of RBC. Your line is open.","Mark Mahaney - RBC","Thanks. I think there was a comment made about demand trends in Europe picking up a little bit. Could you just clarify that a little bit it seems little hard so, what we hearing in other places is there some particular region part of Europe that seems to have recovered a little bit more quickly, thank you.","Steve Kaufer","I guess, it\u2019s always a little hard for us to tell how much is a good stuff we are doing versus macroeconomic picture, it might just be from our perspective more market stabilization so the rest of our campaigns are search engine optimization or traffic purchases or search engine marketing allowing those efforts to kick in at a stronger basis, but we have seen some growth worth mentioning in continental Europe and obviously we didn\u2019t really see much of the slowdown elsewhere.","Mark Mahaney - RBC","Thank you.","Steve Kaufer","Sure, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Devitt of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley","Hi, thanks for taking the question. A few around the hotel shopper growth, just wondering if you could talk through the drivers or to the extent today, maybe missed them, of the acceleration to the mid-30%s in the fourth quarter. And then also Julie mentioned some of the factors of why the click-based revenue did not track closer to the hotel shopper growth, I think Expedia other partners due to macro weakness and then FX and then just wondering if you could bridge those for us? And then lastly to the extent that you can share with \u2013 embedded within your 2013 guidance what you are expecting for full year hotel shopper growth? Thanks.","Steve Kaufer","Sure, I\u2019ll try Scott. A bunch of questions in there, so I \u2013 part of the hotel shopper growth rate, we believe has been the growing brand presence that we have around the globe. So, it\u2019s getting harder and harder to travel to any tourist destinations certainly and not see signs of TripAdvisor as you go. We think that\u2019s a nice halo effect that\u2019s coming right back reflecting in domain direct traffic growth as well as the harder to prove but it is what we believe growth in our search channels. So, as people for instance do a traveler related search on Google and they see TripAdvisor in the result because it\u2019s a brand that they saw a sticker on or they saw a certificate of excellence in the hotel they last stayed at or saw a label on a bus or whatever it might be, more likely to click through. So, we have seen growth in all of our major channels the free ones, the paid ones and some of it again we can only direct at the ongoing strength of the brand and the global nature of it.","Julie Bradley","So, I will take the second part of that. So, when we are looking at the click-based revenue up 24% compared to hotel shoppers growth in the mid-30s. The largest driver is year-on-year pricing. And I think the largest component of that is the rollout of the change in the Expedia pricing in Q4 of last year that was related to the spin. And also some of our other partner pricing on a year-over-year basis a little weaker I think tied to some other macroeconomic weaknesses. The \u2013 a positive factor on pricing is that sequentially we did see an increase in pricing. And then I have listed out a bunch of other factors that are just are frankly more difficult to quantify individually, but we did see an increase in the international traffic phone traffic that we have mentioned earlier and the fact that meta was rolled out on smartphones and then probably to a lesser extent the impact of hurricane Sandy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tom White of Macquarie. Your line is open.","Tom White - Macquarie","Thank you for taking my question. Just wanted to see if there was any update on where you guys were in the rollout of the minimum bid pricing threshold for the CPC product and maybe talk a bit about how you are setting those levels and what the feedback has been from your largest partners. And also on the offline marketing campaign I guess I was sort of curious if you can elaborate a little bit why now, you talked a bit in the past quarter or so and today about how your brand, the brand flywheel has been humming is the decision to do this around kind of expected or current increased competition in the meta search space? Thanks.","Steve Kaufer","Sure thing, so on minimum bids we have rolled out to our major clients a \u2013 what we call property level minimum bids. It\u2019s part of our transition over to the meta space. And we are giving our clients some time to adjust and the rules vary a little bit in terms of what happens if the client has a bid that is below the minimum level. We want to work with our major clients. We have to \u2013 we certainly appreciate and we will need to appreciate that they are trying to often manage bids on tens or hundreds of thousands of properties with different bids depending on where the traveler lives in the world. So, it might be 100,000 properties times, 20 different locales, each locale being worth with different amount in terms of click from that client and that we add on our requests or ability to let clients bid at a mobile level or say phone level, a desktop classic level and the desktop meta level. And so it\u2019s a fair amount of complexity minimum bids are rolling out have rolled out on the meta side of things, desktop meta because that\u2019s where our world is going. And the client reaction has been fine, we just want \u2013 clients just want to make sure that they are reasonable and in general if they can\u2019t afford to bid at the minimum level, they probably won\u2019t getting any traffic anyways because even in our old option if we have five or six players and you were number six, it wasn\u2019t a particularly meaningful property for you anyways. So, I don\u2019t actually think through going up property level minimums affects the folks who are active in the option very much and it\u2019s a little sort of protection the bidding control in what we call the long tail of the properties.","In building a model and trying to evaluate how that\u2019s going to affect our clients is I wouldn\u2019t think it would be particularly meaningful. In terms of the offline, it\u2019s an excellent question. To paraphrase, hey, you haven\u2019t really done offline advertising before why now. And our answer is we\u2019ve been considering it for quite sometime, but we\u2019ve always come to the conclusion of allow that brand flywheel, as we\u2019ve called it before some in the long rate and we have some tremendous traffic growth and then we are talking about visitors in the 100s of millions of year and all sudden it\u2019s at a 45% growth rate at that scale, Holy Cow, that\u2019s just an awful lot of traffic coming to the site. Some inside the company can take the position \u2013 you have taken the position greatest, even just find on it\u2019s own why bother others and I mean the other can\u2019t at the moment have said look we have a brand new value proposition with this price shopping, it\u2019s really good.","We have a couple of existence proves out there in terms of the other meta search players that just have the price shopping and have made a name for themselves with generally offline advertising, great, congrats to them. It shows in our mind that message all by itself resonates with consumers and TripAdvisor now has that or will assume have that rolled out globally. So, we take that price shopping message, combine it with an incredible value proposition around finding the best hotel so take the best hotel and our ability to find the best price on the Internet for that hotel and well, that\u2019s a great message that\u2019s frankly we just wanted to tell the rule about much sooner than they would find out it on their own \u2013 on TripAdvisor. So as I maintained, we\u2019re in it for long-term growth, and by going with an offline campaign, a global offline campaign we feel we can accelerate that growth in the coming years that we haven\u2019t baked any of that in this year is what we do a great job out of the gate and we can look for some revenue upside from that. But it is something that we believe is great for the business and existence proves out there saying and offline campaigns does work for that message amongst our target audience. So, it\u2019s pretty natural at this point for us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Laura Martin of Needham & Company. Your line is open.","Laura Martin - Needham & Company","So I was really fascinated by your comments, Steve about your Facebook growth. Could you talk about both strategically how you think about Facebook versus Google and your revenue mix and also economically, does it save money as you move traffic acquisition over to Facebook, please?.","Steve Kaufer","Sure. Thank you, Laura for the question. Facebook has so many parallel to TripAdvisor as a company in the sense that is very global, it is social and it occupies yet quite a different space. So for us to be able to reach a global audience and global online audience, there is search marketing grade, we know that, we master that and it\u2019s a major channel for us. And then there\u2019s Facebook and this is a channel there are very few people when we look around for example to choose master this channel, very hard to find companies that have really done extremely well other than the gain companies that have built a business on Facebook. So, we really haven\u2019t built our business on Facebook, but we figure out this great way to tap into that audience. And so, it\u2019s the \u2013 our ability with the instant personalization with our TripAdvisor cities I visited map application, we touched 100s of millions of Facebook users or rather Facebook users have told their friends that they have been using TripAdvisor, which is just fantastic social proof. So, it\u2019s been a membership vehicle for us. It\u2019s been a content contribution vehicle for us. It hasn\u2019t been much of a traffic acquisition vehicle for us yet, but we really like the direction that Facebook is headed with their Facebook Exchange and the other improvements to their advertising network. So, we look forward and we are working pretty closely with Facebook to see how we can spend more, how we can do more with Facebook to get the travelers who are spending time on their network over to TripAdvisor to plan their trip. I call the partnership excellent. It really helps both companies. They love the vertical company like TripAdvisor that helps to explain why wisdom of friends is a good thing. We love the social group for travel helps other people plan their trips based upon where their friends have been. And I give the relationship an A+.","Laura Martin - Needham & Company","Very helpful and my follow up question is on the $250 million share repurchase, could you talk through either Steve or Julie how you think about are there targets you have to invest that capital in your shares or how do you think about how you are going to spend that money that you just allocated to us today?","Julie Bradley","Sure. Thanks for the question Laura. This is the board did authorize up to a $250 million share repurchase program. The program is really aimed at allowing the company to be opportunistic. As this being the first year as a public company, we are continuing to evaluate our optimum capital structure. And we just felt that a share repurchase program was an important element to have in place in order to optimize that capital structure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Mike Olson - Piper Jaffray","Hey, good afternoon, just following up on that marketing and social questions. So, you talked about how Facebook is an interesting channel, but more specifically can you talk about how are you will weight the balance between SEM and social in 2013, I think it kind of went back and forth to some degree in 2012. And then given your positive comments on Facebook I guess will the focus be shifting more that way in the coming year and does the offline campaign impact any of the SEM or social initiatives?","Steve Kaufer","Sure Mike, I don\u2019t use them as kind of one or the other shifting between. I look at maximizing each of the three or in previous times two. So, I charter the SEM team with grow, get me the best traffic you can make it profitable, bring it into the TripAdvisor experience. If I need some trial and do it in all markets with sometimes different profitability metrics depending on the market sort of nothing new there. It\u2019s just been a standard part of our playbook. Social, we have been investing for quite some time in adding the Facebook social elements to TripAdvisor to make it a better experience when you are on our site. And at the same time adding more social brand awareness through the Facebook viral mechanisms, which is really all about branding on their platform for us.","The team has \u2013 both teams have grown in size, both teams have grown in spend, the Facebook team versus the SEM team. And if we can find cost effective ways of buying traffic from Facebook, we would love to that I would not expect it to take a penny out of our SEM budget because they have on a limited budget to spend at ROI I set for them. And the same with the crew with the folks trying to buy the traffic on Facebook, if you could find a vehicle, hey we will do that all day long, so as long as it meets our criteria. The offline spend is the first time, where we are looking at a meaningful spend where we don\u2019t expect a positive ROI on it and that\u2019s again to let the world know of this new value proposition, take a page out of some other folks playbooks, but really the whole engine is humming so well now in so many markets that it\u2019s the ability to drop a little more fuel on the fire to get it going even faster is the game plan basically.","Mike Olson - Piper Jaffray","Okay. And then as far as daodao given the intense pricing war in the online travel market in China, is that having any impact on your business there what are you guys seeing that market?","Steve Kaufer","Good question, I wouldn\u2019t say the pricing war is having too much of a challenge on our business. I guess there is a pro and a con to us. The pro is hey if it gets more people traveling because the hotel rooms are cheaper that\u2019s good more people discover us. It\u2019s a con in that is the margins that the OTAs are playing with are a lot less. And therefore they can spend less on buying traffic from sites like daodao or (indiscernible). So, we generally like healthy margins on the part of our clients so net, net I guess I wish there weren\u2019t a price war. We are very happy that Ctrip is as the OTA, so Ctrip plus eLong plus the other guys are all advertising on our platform. So, it\u2019s a nice competitive dynamic everyone\u2019s interested in the traffic we can send. And so like many of our markets its less a sales challenge for us and more a biz dev. how do we grow traffic, how do we grow the content on the site. Clearly, it\u2019s phenomenally huge market a lot, a lot, a lot less to do for us to turn it to deliver the potential that\u2019s there for us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks. Two, if I could. So at risk of beating the marketing horse here, could you give us a little sense of how you\u2019re going to allocate your spend? It\u2019s pretty easy to spend substantial sums in offline media around the world. So can you give us a sense of the prioritization of markets? And then secondly wondering if you could comment on whether the Facebook success has helped you create a bit of a virtuous circle in terms of getting more TripAdvisor visitors contributing content to the platform? I assume that is one of the primary goals as well. Thanks very much.","Steve Kaufer","Sure, so to the first question the offline spend priorities to be frankly we have not mapped them out yet. We are at the earlier stages. So we think of the dollars is being committed, the timing being dictated in the part by when meta completes it\u2019s rollout where we haven\u2019t articulated internally, we haven\u2019t come to our conclusions on where the spend is going to be. In terms of the Facebook, the Facebook success we look at the overall spend there and say it has been remarkably effective for us we can\u2019t tie it directly to traffic as I indicated before, but the global nature absolutely generates more content for us. They become full members everyone that interacts with our app we get the email of they get welcome to our sites, they get after writer review and we\u2019ve learned something about them because the part of the Facebook connect process we\u2019ve learned where they checked in the things around the web that they\u2019ve liked again all this with the permission as they given us but it builds up the database of how we can show how this friends of yours can help you plan the next trip. The most popular places people have been to for instance when you talk to TripAdvisor then you have a friend\u2019s tab when you visit TripAdvisor that\u2019s now populated within half and lot of this information. I\u2019m not sure I completely answered that. So I\u2019m happy to take a follow up if you like.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from Dough Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Dough Anmuth - JPMorgan","Thanks for taking the question. Steve, I was just hoping you could talk to us about how you think about the potential for more of a direct bookings path on the site in the future? And then secondly, any thoughts you might have on two of your biggest partners just buying similar businesses that look, at least a little bit, like TripAdvisor? Thanks.","Steve Kaufer","Sure thanks. So direct booking a topic that certainly comes up some of the other sites out there that has been search offerings have direct bookings that they really process or you will call an assisted booking inventory source but somebody else. We like our position in the media space, we really focus on what do we think our consumers want, what do the travelers want and we are just not hearing at this point that the travelers want the ability to consummate a booking on the TripAdvisor site versus going to other in most cases very well branded sites to their own, but we don\u2019t have religion on the subject, but it\u2019s not a shift that we would do truly for hoping to get some extra margin on or something. Our clients do a fabulous \u2013 our clients, the Pricelines and Expedias and Orbitzes and Travelocities as a world, and all the international ones do a great job for what they do. They contract with hotels, they offer tremendous inventory, they offer great rates, and we are very pleased with our position in the meta world, that\u2019s not only being able to provide the best recommendations fueled by millions reviews from millions of travelers, but also now the best price that you can find on the internet one click away. And for us that addresses what consumers are telling us that they are asking for.","To the second question, hey Priceline is in the process of buying Kayak and Expedia, the same for Trivago, I don\u2019t see it interact \u2013 interfering with our interactions with our big clients. We have the scale. We have the high-quality traffic. The auction is extremely robust, can\u2019t imagine why that will change, the option on TripAdvisor. All these folks still want our leads. And I can appreciate how each of those OTAs would also like to have a little more traffic under their own control to presumably reduce their dependency on the Google and the TripAdvisor and the other sources. So, it makes a certain amount of sense, but doesn\u2019t sort of bother me at all in terms of our growth path and our ability to help more and more travelers. We don\u2019t think prices are changing if that\u2019s all you got is a complete enough offering in the travel research funnel. And it\u2019s really hard and I am not sure even those guys would even try to replicate the type of functionality that TripAdvisor is known for.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Nowak of Nomura. Your line is open.","Brian Nowak - Nomura","Thanks. I have two please. First is I wonder can you give us any help at all on hotel shopper growth by region, even if just a little more clarity on the U.S. and the more mature markets compared to the rest of world? And then secondly, there is a lot of focus in kind of marketing and traffic acquisition costs, I was wondering if you could help us understand kind of rate now within your variable marketing spend, what portion of that is dedicated to your mature markets of the U.S., UK, and Western Europe versus the portion that\u2019s still related to emerging markets where you have a lower brand equity? Thanks.","Steve Kaufer","Sure. So, we haven\u2019t broken out the hotel shopper growth by region other than to say hey, everything grows faster in the Asia-Pacific, in LatAm, and in the brand newer countries, because it\u2019s off of a lower base. We said earlier we are pleased with the growth in the U.S. and UK our most mature markets. And again see no reason why those will be declining going forward, can\u2019t see a ceiling that you are tapping into. For the variable marketing spend, again a large chunk of the variable spend is around search engine marketing and search engine marketing is again the number. So, where is the traffic to buy and that will help you figure out where we are spending the most. To put it in a perspective, there is so much traffic in the U.S. that even if I was spending outrageously, inefficiently, entirely, and they just couldn\u2019t match the amount of traffic that the U.S. has versus those emerging markets. I can\u2019t really give you too much color beyond that other than its absolutely, the variable spend, mostly SEM and it is mostly global. So, it is global by definition. So, we are bidding everywhere we can.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Fitzgerald of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brian Fitzgerald - Jefferies","Thanks. Steve, wondering how your initiative to provide partners with more ROI visibilities progressing, and then maybe as a follow-up you mentioned City Guide coverage is up to 80 cities on the mobile side, how penetrated is that in terms of your total rollout that you see and how quickly are you closing on that complete rollout? Thanks.","Steve Kaufer","Sure thing. So, the ROI visibility to partners, I would say there are \u2013 they are quite pleased in some cases we have delivered more information than they have been able to digest rank reports by region, by property when you are bidding or when you are advertising 100,000 properties on the TripAdvisor wow that\u2019s a lot of data to be able to work with. I would say if you were ask our larger clients I think they would say they love the new information that they are getting, it\u2019s helping them and they love to see it even more self service automated and our public answer to them is and we are getting there. We have been making meaningful strides each quarter for the past couple of quarters now and we are not slowing down. So, I think that piece of it is going well from all angles. The City Guide rollout, it\u2019s an interesting question, we\u2019ve picked we think the 80 most popular cities. We could release another 80 if we wanted to. There is just becoming - we are not at it yet but there is a role or an issue of diminishing returns with do we spend our time doing that or do we spend some more time improving the features we see in the City Guides of the ones that we have rolled out. And actually the team is correctly more focused on a very rapid iterative cycle of improvements and there is point me there and there is check-ins and there is trip journals and there is all sorts of new stuff that just didn\u2019t exist in the app three to six months ago. And that\u2019s really propelling some really impressive engagement numbers and that\u2019s the City Guides app TripAdvisor also launched SeatGuru app which is fantastic airplane advice, what seat do you want to sit on for these long haul flights and combined it with our flight meta search product and some other nice pieces and it\u2019s a new app launched I think it\u2019s already approaching a 1 million downloads, off to the races it\u2019s another app, another iron in the fire if you will and you will see a bunch of these sort of cross-promoted in the future from TripAdvisor.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Kevin Kopelman of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Company","Thanks. Just as you think about revenue growth throughout \u201913 do you expect the headwind from ad changes to the biggest in Q2 or in Q1?","Steve Kaufer","Sorry, do I expect headwinds from ad?","Julie Bradley","Meta.","Steve Kaufer","Oh sorry the meta Q2 is clearly going to be the quarter where we have the most headwinds will be the most fully into that transition again there is some chance that there is really nothing because the option comes into play quicker than we expect. But we are pushing forward on this and if this means that we take a bit of a revenue hit in that quarter in order to get the option off to the races and get to the end point faster, we are willing to do that it\u2019s just a quarter. As I said we have already started in Q1 and we are not our best guess at the moment is that we won\u2019t be completely done by the end of Q2, so you might see a little bit of headwind following into Q3, but again that\u2019s our best guess at the moment and we certainly reserve the right to change the rollout schedule to either faster or lower.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Company","Thank you very much.","Steve Kaufer","Very good.","Operator","And I am not showing any further questions in the queue. I would like to turn call back over to Mr. Steve Kaufer for any further remarks.","Steve Kaufer","Well, alright thanks so much for everyone for joining us today.

Please refer to our earnings release and our filings with the SEC for information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","And with that, I'll pass the call over to Steve.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thank you, Will, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. Hopefully, you've had a chance to read our prepared remarks that we published last night after market close. I'll summarize by saying, 2016 was an important year for TripAdvisor. We continued on our journey towards our North Star building the best end-to-end user experience in travel.","While our accelerated instant booking launch garnered most of the headlines during the year, it was but one of many ongoing initiatives that positions our business for long-term growth. At $1.3 trillion in global spend, the travel opportunity is large and growing and remains intensely competitive. We have a lot of work to do to capture our fair share, but we believe we are now very well positioned.","As we move into 2017, we see faster revenue growth ahead. We are considering certain marketing investments to accelerate the user perception shift to TripAdvisor as not only the best review site, but also the best place to compare prices and book. Ernst?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As expected, 2016 was a challenging year financially with consolidated revenues, GAAP net income, and adjusted EBITDA down 1%, 39%, and 24% respectively.","Coming out of this transition year, we are encouraged by recent trends particularly in our U.S. market where we have completely lapped our instant booking rollout. We will lap the majority of the international rollout this quarter and will continue to invest behind improving monetization trends to enhance revenue growth.","Amidst a competitive travel landscape, we are prioritizing revenue growth as opposed to profit growth this year. We believe this journey will pay off financially, but as I had mentioned before, it will take time. We're moving fast, we're learning and improving and we believe that we are on the path to maximize long-term shareholder value and long-term growth.","With that, we'll open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. The first question is from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. Could you provide your updated thoughts on the monetization gap between desktop and mobile that TripAdvisor is seeing now? Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes. We've seen significant growth in shoppers in the fourth quarter. We saw 22% growth of shoppers. But we saw revenue grow less fast in the fourth quarter, and if we look at the overall year, revenue per shopper for the phone was relatively flat year-on-year, that was better in the first half of the year. And as we discussed on our third quarter call, we made some changes to the app, which we believe position us better for long-term, particularly being more instant booking centric than it was before, which gave us some monetization hit.","That overall improved \u2013 so these trends overall improved the mobile gap year-on-year versus desktop. But there's still work to do on improving the revenue per shopper on mobile, which we're continuing to target in 2017.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey. Good morning. What can you say about instant book conversion versus meta and the difference domestically versus internationally? And then secondly, can you talk about where instant book commission rates stand relative to being fixed rates versus transitioning into an auction-based system? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. So again, it's a little hard to evaluate instant book conversions in isolation, because it really portends the change in user experience where someone's coming through the flow and they may not convert the first time, but it engages them enough to come back to the site. And when someone does in fact go down the instant book path, they do, in fact, come back more frequently to TripAdvisor, if they hadn't booked first time around than the second time.","When we look at the instant book conversion, because we now have better pricing in the store, because we've done our optimizations, you've seen the kind of the raw numbers increase about 20% year-on-year for our U.S. desktop. So, we're pleased with that. We still have a ways to go, though. When we look at the second part of your question with respect to \u2013 sorry, the second part of the question was?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Fixed versus variable.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah, fixed versus variable on auction. Sorry about that. We already have the system in place whereby our partners can sort of bid a different commission level for their properties and that is one of the factors that is taken into account when we decide who wins the instant booking offering.","So yes, we already take into account the commission offered to us by way of an auction, but I wouldn't suggest that, that's a big monetization opportunity for us going forward. It's auction-based, it will help; but the bigger piece is really going to be the consumer intent coming to the site.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Scott Devitt of Stifel. Your line is open.","Scott Devitt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you. I have two. First, on that brand marketing in 2017, can you just talk about the factors in terms of determining whether you'll embark on that campaign or not?","And then secondly, Expedia mentioned on their call they wouldn't be fully participating in direct book, I think, through 2017 and 2018. Can you talk about the level of inventory that you have in the system now in terms of how complete you have for availability without their full participation? And then, also what the factors are for Expedia becoming a full participant? Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. Let me take the second part of the question first. When we think of Expedia as an instant book client, we think of a number of different pieces. It's Expedia, and Hotels.com, and what if, and Hotwire and Travelocity and Orbitz and all the different brands; that's one component. Then there's how much inventory do we get from each of the brands, and then there's how active can they be in our auction in each market.","So, the most important thing to us, and I think the most important thing to Expedia \u2013 well, I'll just speak for us, the most important thing to us is to actually have all of the best pricing from all of the Expedia brands. And we have that in the U.S. now and we're well on our way to getting that in the rest of the world.","Most of the brands are online now, I don't think all of them are, but we're getting the biggest bang for the buck from our perspective in terms of when they have excellent pricing we're able to use show it in our store.","I think part of the confusion is the limitations that we have in terms of rolling out Expedia and enabling them as an OTA partner to compete in each and every auction around the globe. And some of that, as has been alluded to before, it's just a question of timing.","We think the biggest impact that Expedia instant book for us is already evident in the markets that it's rolled out in and it will continue to rollout in other markets over the course of the year. So, we're very pleased, and of course, Expedia is looking forward to being able to participate in more auctions over time and drive more bookings from us as a platform. So two thumbs up on that one.","When it comes to the brand marketing, we're excited by what we've seen in terms of improvements once we lapped IB in fourth quarter and into January. When we look at all the different pieces of the puzzle, we want to make sure that the product is solid, not just in instant book pricing, but also in the entire flow. We want to make sure that our message is resonating with consumers and we'll be evaluating the scope and timing. So to be clear, we're in evaluation mode, so that tells you we're serious about it, but we won't be spending in Q1. And we'll give you an update as we move forward with that decision process.","Scott Devitt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Steve.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Perry Gold of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC","Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. While sequential improvement in the growth of Trip's click-based ad revenue line was actually fairly robust this quarter, can you help us better understand why some of the other revenue lines like display and subscription and non-hotel revenue were a bit softer sequentially? Were these all traffic-related issues or were there some other underlying factors here? Thanks so much.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes, Perry. This is Ernst. You're correct to highlight those lines, and they were relatively soft in the fourth quarter compared to the full-year trends and also compared to our anticipation going forward in 2017. The drivers were a little different. On our subscription and display business there was some seasonality. Sometimes, especially in our display business, the end of the year is lumpy, and we saw some softness in that, that we don't necessarily project going forward.","Our Other hotel revenue is mostly driven by our SmarterTravel brands, and here also we saw some softness that was mostly traffic-related for them. Other revenue as a category was up for us for the full-year. It was meaningfully down, of course, in the fourth quarter; and again, that is not a trend that we expect to continue into the following year.","Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC","Great. Thanks, Ernst.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Naved Khan of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Yeah. Thank you very much. I had a question on competition and margins. So some of the other players in the space like Trivago are going pretty fast and they're also spending a ton of money on TV advertising. And obviously, they have pretty low margins. So, the question is really, if you go out and start a brand advertising campaign, how do you see your margins evolving longer-term? Do you think they could be as low as where your competitors are? And any comments on Priceline's acquisition of Momondo?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. So, when we look at the opportunity on TV, and as you know, we've been on TV in years past, we do have to note, tip our hat to the fact that other players in the industry have been on TV in many years and it's been working for them.","We have a phenomenal amount of unaided and aided brand awareness in most parts of the world, and so our challenge with TV is a little bit different and some might say easier, some might say harder, of course. It's the challenge of delivering a different message, as people love us for reviews, if I were to overly generalize, and teaching them with the brand campaign that we're the best spot for price comparison and booking. And not necessarily completing the transaction on TripAdvisor with instant book, but what I really mean is with the campaign to educate folks that we're the site that they should come back to or come to when they're ready to make a transaction.","And if they click off in our meta-auction to one of our great partners, amen. If they follow through and book on instant booking, that works just as well. And in general, we like to think of ourselves as reasonably indifferent in the two, with instant booking providing probably a more strategic advantage to us on the phone.","So, I think to the question of impact on margins, it's clearly an opportunity for us to invest, because if we can shift the perception of all of the folks that are already coming to TripAdvisor, let alone drive some new traffic, our revenue per shopper and the rest of our core metrics can potentially rise, fueling a lot of the additional growth in spend. So, we don't see a reason why margins would end up at current Trivago levels, that would be silly for a company of our size, but we do see it being a reasonable opportunity for us.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And to add to that, as we said in our prepared remarks also that if we \u2013 and again, we're still in evaluation mode, but if we were to decide to pursue this brand investment, it would likely negatively impact near-term adjusted EBITDA. But we would make that investment really with an eye on the long-term, and we've made some commentary about where we see our profitability profile go over time.","And we think that TV advertising could help, very importantly, help move that user perception and increase the monetization that we can get from our hotel shoppers, increase that revenue per shopper over time and thereby improve our economics. So, as we think about our long-term economics and we look at it in absolute EBITDA terms, we believe that our current strategy and potentially enhanced by brand marketing will allow us to grow profitability over the longer-term.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And to your second question on the Priceline acquisition of Momondo, personally, I thought it was probably a pretty good move for them. Consolidation continues in the space, I think it gives Kayak a nice \u2013 a growth footprint outside of the U.S., which just makes them more of a global player, and that will help fuel downstream demand. In terms of our flights business, I'd be surprised if there ended up being a meaningful impact one way or the other.","Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Justin Patterson of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. In terms of just the overall funnel here, we keep seeing the OTA is doing a lot more around things to do, Airbnb has its Guidebooks, Google has its trips product in the market. How do you envision that really affecting traffic? Is that something that TripAdvisor can start monetizing \u2013 or pushing out to its users a little bit better to help shopper growth organically? Or I guess is there something that Google and the others can do that potentially hurts your traffic a little bit more? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure, Justin. So, when we look at the attractions space and the things that Expedia is doing and Google is doing, we kind of view it as wonderful validation that the online community is ready for more booking before they actually arrive at a destination; or if they're using our app, booking while they are in market.","So, we have to the best of our ability to count, the biggest and best supply for attractions. And so while there's many different ways to research, we have a heck of a lot of traffic and we have the best booking capabilities in most parts of the world. So, as users learn how to explore and book online, those transactions are more likely than not going to flow through us, even if they happen to start on a Google.","Expedia is able to help someone who they already have going to a location, to a very popular location, find something to book. But we really have, I would argue, we have the long tail and plenty of top-of-funnel traffic to really thrive in that category.","Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mark May of Citi. Your line is open.","Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. I wanted to revisit the EBITDA outlook and the potential advertising campaign. It appears as though your EBITDA outlook may already include a step-up in advertising spend this year, although that's obviously difficult to ascertain. But to what extent are you already modeling in kind of a step-up in advertising already and an increase in your ad expense ratio in your guide? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes. Thanks, Mark. This is Ernst. In our current plan, we are modeling a significant step-up in paid marketing. It is in the performance-based category, so very similar to what we have been spending throughout 2016 and its online marketing.","We're carving out specifically a considered longer-term TV or other brand marketing campaign, because we think the profile of that is somewhat different. And the profile is different in a sense of the objectives that we have with it, which is much more around positioning us as a brand and moving user perception as well as creating new traffic. And it will have, in all likelihood, a slightly different financial profile with a longer-term payback period than performance-based market.","Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Sure. That makes sense.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","That's why we differentiate between the two. So, the forward-looking statement that we have given about our EBITDA for 2017, flat to down year-on-year incorporates the significant step-up of performance-based marketing. It does not incorporate the brand investment under consideration and that will be separate and then additional as we pointed out in our prepared remarks.","Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And just to frame \u2013 help us kind of frame the thinking around the potential brand spend, historically, when you've done this what was sort of your annualized marketing budget for brand in TV? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Historically, if I go back all the way to 2013, it was about 30; 2014 was about 30; 2015 was roughly 50. Those were not consistent campaigns throughout the year. They were also not consistent globally, but that was the reference point and we are evaluating where we're going to go from here.","Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And in terms of 2016, roughly how much you spent on brand in TV?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","In 2016, we were not on TV.","Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Chris Merwin of Barclays. Your line is open.","Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. I just had a couple. So, could you talk a bit about how conversion has been trending for instant book? I think you \u2013 obviously you mentioned spending more on performance-based advertising in the U.S. So, I'm just curious how well you're converting that traffic and how much more improvement you need to see there to get margins moving up again?","And then the second question is on the branded marketing campaign. I know a few years ago, you tried this and you didn't get the desired results at the time, although, obviously, it was much earlier days for instant book then. So, can you just talk a bit about what you're hoping to do differently this time around? Or is it just a function of the product being much further along in its development, so the TV buy should be more effective? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","In terms of conversion on instant booking, we referenced it as a response to an earlier question. We've seen a very good instant booking monetization improvement \u2013 conversion rate-improvement over the last year. We called out our U.S. instant book conversion rate, which improved 20% year-on-year, and we continued to make improvements there. So, we feel we're on the right path. The increased marketing expenditure has not undermined that trend, so we have seen good trends there. In terms of the comparison with previous campaigns, do you want to take that, Steve?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. So, I think we're probably aiming for something a little bit different now, where previous TV campaigns were focused on an actual booking event on TripAdvisor. We're really at this point with our online campaigns as well as anything that we would consider offline, focusing on the price comparison and letting TripAdvisor be the site that you're always coming back to when you're ready to book.","I think we've made the point innumerable times, we have so much traffic, hotel shopping traffic, that's already up funnel, that's already discovering us, through indirect or through any of our channels, and love us for reviews. So, our opportunity to get those individuals to come back, let alone grow the market, remains a phenomenal needle mover for us, and that would certainly be a focus of any offline campaign should we run one.","Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Paul Bieber of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, I was hoping you could provide a little bit of color about what the big product priorities are for instant book in 2017? And which one of the product priorities really has an opportunity to drive monetization?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. But I'll rephrase the question, because from my thinking it's not really an instant book product priority. It is a hotel shopping experience priority, and that spans all devices. We really want to make it as smooth as possible, as easy as possible, to find the best price, because we have a phenomenal price comparison engine that's pulling prices from 200+ sites all around the web. We have great relationships with hotel chains, with all the major online travel agencies in basically every market around the globe.","So, how can we do a better job demonstrating to our travelers that we've done the hard work for you, we've found the best price, we're putting it in front of you, and when the TripAdvisor booking option happens to have the best price, and if you've already stored your credit card with TripAdvisor, super. Instant book makes for a very easy and smooth transaction, but it's fine if you go down the route of clicking off to a phenomenal partner like Expedia or Priceline.","We still collect a referral fee, our monetization still improves, and so long as we can attract more top-of-funnel shoppers, turn those shoppers into higher intent bookers, because we've helped them decide that this is the right hotel for them, which is the content we have, plus the great price comparison, then we've done our job in the funnel, qualified somebody and sent them downstream.","So, I think over the past six months, you've seen meaningful improvements in sort of the price transparency on the site. I think you'll continue to see over the next several quarters more of that, plus just a smoother shopping experience to delight our travelers.","Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning. This is Dave (27:56) in for Doug. Thank you for taking my question. First one, since you now have two big OTAs on the instant booking platform along with most of the large chains, could you talk about the IB participation dynamic among the suppliers? I think you mentioned auction, but if you could provide more color on how you determine who provides the booking, that would be helpful?","And then on performance marketing, I assume that signals that IB is competitive versus other booking sites in those channels, so if you could provide more color on where you're using the performance marketing channels, and if that's globally, and if not, then when can we expect to see that being used globally? Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. So, the second part of the question, what performance channels are we using? We pretty much use them all. I think we're very strong in almost every global market in any sort of performance-marketing channels. If you know of one that you don't see us in, let me know, it's an oversight, not a strategic decision. Obviously, the big ones are search engines and social networks and if that platform has scale then we're using it.","In terms of how we decide who's providing the instant booking; again, I caution you on that may be \u2013 that is a very important and valid question that our partners want to know, because they're eager to gain share in our instant booking marketplace, but the commission deltas or that selection isn't critical in our overall monetization. So, when we look at growing now throughout 2017 and beyond, you look at the overall picture of how we translate a top-of-funnel hotel shopper into that clicker, whether they click on instant book or meta. And so, it's more significant for us, for instance, to figure out how to drive higher-qualified leads by providing better content about hotels, better photos, et cetera, downstream to our OTA partners or the chain partners than see if we can eke out a few more basis points of commission via an auction.","So, IB \u2013 to more specifically answer the question about the instant book auction, primary factor is which of our partners offers us the best price to book the room, because we know our travelers care most about the price, and so it's usually, who has the lowest price is going to win the auction. When you have a supplier brand plus an OTA brand offering the same price for a particular property, we have a calculation that attempts to understand the likely conversion rate between the branded player and the OTA times the commission rate, and that gets us an effective CPC. It's more nuanced than that, but for the sake of this call, that's the general game plan.","Unknown Speaker","Understand. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Kevin Kopelman of Cowen & Co. Your line is open.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks a lot. Can you give us a sense of how big instant book revenue is compared to metasearch revenue on the flagship site? And then just the relative growth rates there of IB versus meta, as we think about that double-digit growth rate for 2017. Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Instant booking is a minority of our total auction revenues, so meta is still by far the larger revenue stream. We don't break out the exact percentages. It's a meaningful percentage as an IB, but it's a clear minority. And as we go forward and project next year, we don't break out any growth between meta and IB, but reasonable to believe that we expect progress in all.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Ernst.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Brad Erickson of Pacific Crest. Your line is open.","Brad D. Erickson - Pacific Crest Securities","Thanks. Can you just talk about your platform in place \u2013 that you have in place from a test and learn perspective? I mean you're going up against obviously some pretty big competitors here in booking who have arguably state-of-the-art capabilities when it comes to improving conversion through test and learn. Where is your platform at competitively? And then how much does this forward EBITDA commentary reflect potentially higher spending around platform improvements? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. We've been doing the AB testing, test and learn, all devices, all markets, for a long, long time. Testing the conversion as well as search engine optimization, landing pages, purchase funnels, the works. We know that really quite well and so I haven't seen the insight of other players, but I don't want to sound boastful, but I think we're probably pretty close to best-in-class in that category.","When we look at the ability to test, it all comes down to the benefits of scale. And at our close to 400 million unique users a month, we just have an awful lot of traffic coming through the site and so that enables us to run tons and tons of tests. The increased \u2013 or as we go forward, to answer the question of do we need to invest more EBITDA into improving the platform? The answer is no. We're quite comfortable with the platform, and the marketing expense that we look at is really related to the ability to buy more performance-based traffic, because the site is monetizing better each quarter.","Brad D. Erickson - Pacific Crest Securities","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Tom White of Macquarie. Your line is open.","Tom White - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. As we think about lapping the bulk of the international rollout of IB, should we expect to sort of see a similar reacceleration in the click-based and transaction revenue growth that you guys are seeing in the U.S.? I think you said it was double-digits there in its first full quarter post the lap of the U.S. Are there structural reasons why the international reacceleration might be different? And then just on pricing in the meta auction, can you give us a sense of what's happening with pricing, CPC pricing in meta generally and your outlook there? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes. We've seen \u2013 after lapping in the U.S., which was in August, we've seen very good growth in the U.S. And we've said we've seen double-digit growth; we've recently seen growth over 20% in the U.S. market.","Now we are, this quarter, going to lap everywhere else and we do expect to see that \u2013 that to mean that we can improve the growth rates relative to 2016. We want to be careful, though, in just extrapolating what we saw in the U.S. to every other market outside of the U.S., every market is different.","Our U.S. is our strongest market, and the lapping will show different results in different markets. So, although, we believe it will mean improvement, we want to be sort of conservative in our outlook, if it's going to be close to the U.S. or not. The U.S. will, in all likelihood throughout the year lead all these other markets in terms of revenue growth.","In terms of CPCs, we don't give any particular guidance on where we see CPCs go. CPCs are volatile throughout the year, it's the output of an auction, not an input of our pricing decision and therefore fluctuates over time. It all comes together in a revenue per shopper for us, which is a metric that we look at much more closely, but we don't give specific guidance to either CPC or revenue per shopper. We have a number of initiatives in place to drive a better user experience, improve our conversion rates. That when successful should help us get better CPCs and better revenue per shopper, but we don't give any particular guidance to it.","Tom White - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Two if I may. Thank you. First of all, could you give us a little color around the new hotel sort algorithm that you mentioned in your letter? And then secondly, on the revenue per hotel shopper trend that you've put in the letter as well, has it turned positive in the U.S.? Thanks so much.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","I'll take the first question. On the new hotel sort, you'll see currently \u2013 and we played around with this for many years, the notion that a raw ratings list is not necessarily what the consumers want. Several years ago, we had a 'Just For You' personalized list, where we're trying to give you, you the customer, a better view in to which hotels are going to be right for you in a particular city. We've rolled out in some of our markets on some of the platforms a new hotel sort that really takes price into account, so that we're less likely to be showing you by default, to take an extreme case, $1,000 a-night hotels at the top of a city when the vast, vast majority of our audience could never be interested in that.","So again, the sort is aimed at improving the hotel shopping experience in the subcategory of helping you, the traveler, find the best hotel at the best price. We remain true to our kind of unbiased \u2013 we want to only be giving you great hotels, recommending to you great hotels, but we have to make sure that they are affordable to the person that's doing the shopping.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And indeed, revenue per shopper growth in the fourth quarter was positive in the U.S. It was still improving, but still negative year-on-year globally. But, it was positive in the U.S.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, Ernst.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jed Kelly of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. If you choose to execute a brand campaign, would you plan to advertise around any of your non-hotel products, or would the vast majority be dedicated to the hotel shopper experience?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Hi, this is Steve. Thanks, Jed, for the question. It's a good one. We have such a breadth of audience, such breadth of product, we can offer so much in the full trip. But, we clearly view our challenge over the next year or two to focus in on the TripAdvisor as a great place to compare prices and book.","So, you might see another one of our businesses do some independent TV campaigns. If you're in Italy, you might see a TV ad for TheFork, our restaurant app. So, I'm not saying it would be the only one, but when we talk about materiality and when we talk about considering a brand campaign, it's certainly just going to be around the core hotel shopping experience.","Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from James Lee of CLSA. Your line is open.","James Lee - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you help us understand how should we think about the monetization closing the gap between IB and meta in international markets? In the U.S., I think you closed the gap in four quarters. So, how should we think about international market, especially if we take into context that the region is a lot more fragmented?","And second question on IB is, I'm just curious why you're able to close the gap on PC, but not on mobile specifically. Why would mobile be more difficult in terms of closing the gap? Because I thought the original intention of creating IB was you want to close the loop on mobile on meta specifically? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","I think the first important point to point out is we're not necessarily looking at IB monetization versus meta. What we're looking for is getting our total conversion on the site up and getting our total monetization for our shoppers up.","And what that means in practice is that we have an IB product, we have a meta product. Dependent on the particular search of the shopper, we will see price as an important driver of it. Do we have the best price in IB? It's more likely that would put IB in front. Do we have the best price in meta? More likely that we put the meta option in front. So, we will privilege IB versus meta dependent on a number of factors. So, it's not necessarily just a side-by-side and one compares such and one compares the other. And so we are much more focused on the overall.","Having said that, as we said, we've improved IB over time, especially in the U.S., likely to keep improving it outside, not necessarily at the same pace, and we will see that the same on the phone. But it's not our primary focus. Our primary focus is making sure the overall shopper experience creates the most bookings at the best possible price for us.","James Lee - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. And just elaborate international timing or international in terms of reaching the parity or monetization between IB and meta versus U.S. market. Help us understand the timing a little bit. Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","U.S., clearly ahead. We rolled out earlier, lapped earlier. We're lapping in Europe this quarter. We'll have more to say when we see more of those results, but we expect to continue to \u2013 outside of the U.S. to lag U.S. performance.","James Lee - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Dan Wasiolek of Morningstar. Your line is open.","Dan Wasiolek - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just on the non-hotel side, I know you called out FX as a headwind in 2016. But just trying to gauge the growth rate of this segment in 2017 and kind of noting on a two-year stacked trend how it's slowed some in the last six months of 2016. Just wondering, if there is, I guess anything else besides FX that maybe was a headwind, model transition, et cetera, at the end of 2016 to help me model \u2013 or help us model for 2017? Thank you.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","So, our non-hotel growth was solid in the fourth quarter, 31% year-on-year. Our full-year growth in non-hotel was very solid too. So, we're very pleased with the progress we're continuing to make on revenue growth as well as on the underlying availability of product and we don't give specific guidance for our non-hotel segment growth rate, but we're pleased where things are and we expect solid growth from the non-hotel segment going forward.","Dan Wasiolek - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. Thanks. And just quickly one more, if I could. Sales and the marketing expense, as we look into 2018, maybe it's a little bit early, but do you think that the levels of sales and marketing as a percent of revenue in 2018 would be above 2016 levels? Thank you.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","2017?","Dan Wasiolek - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","For 2018, if the sales and marketing expense as a percent of revenue in that year would be above the levels that we saw in 2016, just kind of taking a little bit of a forward look out. Maybe it's a little bit early. But just wondering, if any thoughts on the lift here in sales and marketing, whether or not that's going to be sustained to some degree beyond the investment you're taking in 2017?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","I think it is a bit too early to talk about 2018, we're early 2017.","Dan Wasiolek - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Brian Fitzgerald of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Stan Velikov - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. This is Stan Velikov for Brian. Thanks for taking my question. Outside of the impact of instant booking rollout, were there any other important factors that impacted growth across international geographies?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","The instant booking rollout was important. We've also called out that we're operating in a competitive environment and our competition has not been standing still. As a result of the instant booking rollout and the revenue per shopper pressure we saw as a result of that, we have not been able to grow our performance-based marketing line as much as some other players in the industry have, and so we have continued to operate in that environment, which has contributed to our 2016 performance.","Stan Velikov - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions in the queue. I'll turn the call back over to Steve Kaufer for closing remarks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Okay. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining the call. I really want to thank our employees around the globe for their hard work in 2016.

Please go ahead.","Will Lyons","Thanks, Eric. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to TripAdvisor's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Steve Kaufer, our CEO; and Julie Bradley, our CFO.","We distributed our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at ir.tripadvisor.com. In it, you will find reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures discussed on this call. On our Investor Relations website, we have also posted supplemental financial information, including non-GAAP financial measures.","Before we begin I'd like to remind you that estimates and other forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view as of today, February 11, 2015.

We saw great user growth and engagement around the world especially on mobile devices, and we made nice progress on our various growth initiatives. Total revenue grew 35% for the fourth quarter and 32% for the year to more than $1.2 billion. Click-based advertising revenue grew 25% for both the quarter and for the year. Adjusted EBITDA was $98 million for the quarter and $468 million for the year, up 88% and 23%, respectively.","Most importantly, 2014 began the next chapter for TripAdvisor, enabling users to plan, compare and book in 3 of our largest demand categories: hotels, attractions and restaurants. Our mission is to help travelers plan and book the perfect trip, and we are investing in a number of initiatives that position us for long-term growth. Starting this quarter, we will talk about our business in 2 distinct segments: hotel and other. Our Hotel segment encompasses click, display, subscription and transaction-based revenue from hotels, air, cruise, including our largest subsidiary, SmarterTravel, as well as our operations in China. Our Other segment consists of attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals, each of which are at earlier stages of growth. Julie will cover this in her financial commentary.","With that in mind, I'll update you on our progress in the context of what we plan to do over the next 2 years, and then I'll outline our objectives for the 3- to 5-year time frame. Over the next 2 years, our top priorities are to expand our lead in content and community and to help our travelers, not only plan their trip, but to book it as well. In terms of community, according to Google Analytics, TripAdvisor had more than 2.5 billion unique users in 2014, up approximately 25%. Needless to say, we're excited by our continued traffic growth, especially at our size.","And our community continues to engage and contribute more content. We eclipsed 200 million reviews and opinions. We're growing content at more than 125 contributions per minute in 28 different languages, and we nearly tripled non-English content over the past 2 years. Our clients are also engaging with us in more ways, with approximately 25% of registered property owners responding to a user review in 2014, and more and more independent owners, as well as a big hotel chains, are using TripAdvisor tools to make review collection a systematic part of their post-stay communications. With more than 1.6 million listings of places to stay, including 915,000 hotels and 650,000 vacation rentals, as well as 2.4 million restaurants and 500,000 attractions, TripAdvisor remains the preeminent brand in travel and leisure.","Content and community are the lifeblood of our brand. And in 2015, we plan to continue to aggressively grow these assets. Our engaged audience has a very high purchase intent, and we are making the TripAdvisor platform more valuable for users and advertisers. Consider that in a recent comScore study, over 40% of online hotel bookers in 9 of our top markets visited TripAdvisor at some point prior to booking. Through Instant Booking, we aim to monetize a greater percentage of these transactions by becoming a convenient place to compare prices and then book. Just this week, we rolled out Instant Booking to more U.S. desktop and tablet users and launched the feature to a small percentage of U.K. phone users.","On the partner side, we've been making nice progress as well, as we recently signed top hotel brands Accor and Carlson. We signed 43 partners in total, 12 that are live and are powering bookings and 31 that are being implemented. In Q4, we launched an Instant Booking beta on TripConnect, giving independent hoteliers direct access to TripAdvisor's global hotel demand. Early results have been positive and some partners have noted that Instant Booking has quickly become one of their most effective marketing channels.","Complementing our Instant Booking initiative, we recently added a \"plan, compare and book\" message to our online and offline channels. This includes TV, an area where we plan to double our investment in 2015 to approximately $60 million. We see television as an important way to get our new \"plan, compare and book\" message out to our global audience.","We have other partner initiatives that have made nice progress during 2014. First, we have improved our ability to demonstrate a strong ROI for partners through Business Listings. We now have more than 81,000 subscribers and have aligned pricing to more directly track to the booking value that a partner sees on our platform. Moving forward, we see Business Listings playing into a more holistic hotel-client relationship. This evolving relationship over the next couple of years will likely include products built on top of our data management platform, which is driving scalable, real-time insights so that partners can deliver the right message to the right user at just the right time. We're already seeing great early benefits in our display business, where we have maintained high CPMs across more than 2,000 advertisers in all major travel categories. We also can leverage these insights into our personalization and mobile monetization initiatives.","Finally, in mobile, we continue to expand our lead in terms of adoption and engagement on these devices. Nearly 50% of users visited TripAdvisor via tablet and phone in 2014, and our apps have been downloaded nearly 175 million times. This includes more than 155 million downloads of our top-ranked TripAdvisor app, which has been growing organically at triple-digit rates for the last 6 quarters. We've achieved small but steady monetization improvements on the phone over the past couple of years. We believe Instant Booking can be a game changer here.","Next, let's talk about our strategy over the 3- to 5-year time frame. While our past, present and future remain deeply rooted in the hotel category, over the next 3 to 5 years, we want to help more users find and book attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals and establish our leadership position in these categories. In attractions, Viator announced it will soon augment its curated model with an open marketplace. This will allow Viator to rapidly grow its product portfolio, giving users better choice and driving higher conversion to bookings. We're very pleased with our integration. And since closing the deal in August, we've more than doubled Viator's bookings from the TripAdvisor platform.","In restaurants, we've been very busy since we announced our LaFourchette acquisition in May. We acquired 3 more businesses in Q4, mytable and restopolis in Italy and Iens in The Netherlands. In addition to these markets, TripAdvisor's bookable restaurant inventory now spans France, Spain, Switzerland, Belgium, Turkey, Sweden and Denmark, reinforcing our leadership position in Europe. We rebranded our restaurant platform as TheFork, and we're sending 4x as many restaurant bookings from TripAdvisor. Over the next 3 to 5 years, we're investing to significantly expand TheFork's reach within new and existing markets.","In Vacation Rentals, we continue to successfully scale our free-to-list transaction model. In 2014, we drove more inventory, more traveler inquiries, more bookings and strong revenue growth. At the end of Q4, we had more than 650,000 vacation rental listings driven by 73% listings growth in our free-to-list business. Free-to-list bookings grew 130% in Q4 and more than 280% for the full year, and we see this becoming more than 50% of our Vacation Rentals revenue in 2015. Over the next 3 years, we're focused on listings growth, owner engagement, user awareness and product enhancements to drive higher customer satisfaction and more transactions on our platform.","Finally, let me briefly touch upon some of our other long-term objectives. As the world's largest travel site, we gather information about traveler preferences and activities at phenomenally large scale. It's hard to predict all of the possibilities that this scale presents, but we want to make sure that we are always exploring what the next generation of travel planning features, products and services might be and how our scale can deliver benefits that nobody else can even dream of. Personalization is one such feature. Currently, we are personalizing millions of hotel shopper sessions per week, and users are engaging, clicking more and contributing more revenue per session. The beauty of this feature is not just the design and code that created it, but rather the machine learning that takes place over a multiyear time frame, driving a better set of travel advice and answers for every subsequent user. Over time, we want to be every user's personal travel guide, whether someone is looking for a place to stay, a place to eat or something to do while on their trip. Today, we are only scratching the surface of what's possible.","Another long-term initiative is becoming a top player in China. As the largest market for outbound travel expenditures, China is a huge opportunity for everyone. What differentiates TripAdvisor in this incredibly competitive market is that we bring the full range of travel content for your entire trip, not just a place to stay. During this past year, we broadened our suite of travel products tailor-made for Chinese travelers and have seen a growing demand for our international content. It is still very early days when it comes to tapping into the outbound Chinese traveler market, which is why our China business remains squarely in investment mode.","As you've just heard, 2014 was a year of great progress along our major initiatives, and we're at the early stages of many large and exciting growth opportunities. This month celebrates our 15-year anniversary, and I can tell you that there's never been a more exciting time for TripAdvisor. We continue to operate a massive and growing business at speed, staying focused on what's best for users, what's best for partners and what's best for our business over the long term.","Before I conclude, a reminder again about our investment philosophy as we pursue our growth plans. At $1.3 trillion in travel bookings, the global online travel market is large, lucrative and increasingly competitive. We prioritize top line growth, market share gains and EBITDA dollar growth, and we'll continue to reinvest profit when we see large opportunities in front of us.","Finally, I want to thank all TripAdvisor employees around the globe. Your hard work delivered these great results, and you remain our largest asset as we build a bigger and better business. It was a great 2014, and I'm excited about where we're headed.","I'll now turn the call over to Julie.","Julie M. B. Bradley","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a great quarter and year. Fourth quarter total revenue was up 35% and 39% on a constant currency basis, driven by our large and growing click-based business, as well as a full quarter contribution from LaFourchette and Viator. Q4 click-based revenue grew 25% or 30% on a constant currency basis, driven by 23% hotel shopper growth and solid CPC pricing for our high-value leads. Full year click-based revenue growth of 25% was driven by 17% hotel shopper growth and an easing pricing comparison due to our 2013 metasearch transition. Revenue per hotel shopper growth was positive 3% for the fourth quarter and positive 7% for the full year, a nice recovery from our negative 9% and negative 13% results in the comparable periods last year. As Steve noted, we continue to lead on mobile, and I'll add that just over 2\/3 of our traffic growth came on the phone, which monetizes at a lower rate than desktop and tablet and continues to be a headwind.","Display-based revenue growth finished 2014 on a very solid note, growing 13% in the fourth quarter despite a tougher comp. Full year 2014 display revenue grew 18%, fueled by more page views, a shift in our client mix to a more attractive always-on spend cadence and bolstered by our ad tech improvements that has increased the marketers' ability to target. We maintain our premium position in the travel ad marketplace, and our 2014 performance compares very favorably to the declines posted by many other CPM-based businesses.","Subscription, transaction and other revenue grew 97% for the quarter and 82% for the year. In addition to a full quarter contribution from LaFourchette and Viator, the primary drivers were value-based pricing in Business Listings and increased traffic, inventory and transactions in attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals.","Specific to geographic mix, our U.S. and U.K. markets remain strong, and we continue to see a gradual shift in a mix towards international markets. Most recently, we've seen a nice return to growth in LatAm, where we've made progress working with large regional OTAs in that market. International revenue or revenue to sites other than .com increased slightly as a percentage of total growth based on hotel shopper and CPC growth globally, as well as strong performance of our display and Business Listing products overseas. As a result, Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $98 million, up 88% or 98% on a constant currency basis versus negative 19% in the year-ago quarter. This was primarily due to the high concentration of television advertising in Q4 2013. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 34% for the quarter and deleveraged 2 percentage points to 38% for the full year, primarily due to ongoing investments to gain market share in our attraction and restaurant businesses, which are operating at earlier stages of their growth cycle.","Steve mentioned our new segment breakout, which we believe provides us and investors with better information to assess overall business performance. We have provided historical revenue and adjusted EBITDA for each segment in our Q4 earnings press release. Hotel segment revenue growth accelerated to 26%, with very solid 42% adjusted EBITDA margins for the full year. Our Other reportable segment consists of attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals. These businesses are all in investment mode. Other segment revenue grew 141% in 2014, driven by continued strong growth in Vacation Rentals and our LaFourchette and Viator acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment was negative 4% as we absorbed our attraction and restaurant businesses' cost structures and began to fund international expansion and top line growth initiatives in these categories. We believe we are striking an appropriate balance between growth and profitability today and believe that we could start to see adjusted EBITDA margin improvement in this segment as these businesses achieve global scale.","Moving on to headcount, we ended the year with nearly 2,800 employees, up 38%, driven by acquisitions and our investments in attracting and retaining top-tier talent to pursue our growth initiatives.","Our full year 2014 GAAP effective tax rate was nearly 30%, which is higher than our annual expectation due to certain discrete items. Our projected 2015 GAAP tax rate is 27% to 28% and is dependent on jurisdictional revenue and expense mix, among other factors. We ended 2014 with 146 million diluted shares outstanding, and we estimate that our diluted share count will increase roughly 1% to 2% by the end of 2015 subject to stock price movement, potential share buybacks and new share issuances.","CapEx for the quarter was $26 million or 9% of revenue. Full year CapEx was $81 million or 7% of revenue. Capitalized engineering salaries represented roughly 1\/2 of our full year CapEx, while the remainder was driven by leasehold improvements to support our global growth and, to a lesser degree, data center expansion to support our traffic growth. In 2015, we expect capital expenditures to be roughly 5% of revenue.","In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $62 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter and $387 million for the full year or 31% of revenue. The fourth quarter exhibited typical seasonality from our transaction businesses, Vacation Rentals, Viator, Tingo and Jetsetter, in which stays are incurred and tickets are used more in the third quarter summer travel season as opposed to the fourth quarter. We delivered $306 million of free cash flow this year or 25% of revenue.","From a liquidity standpoint, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities decreased $76 million during the year to $594 million, driven primarily by free cash flow, offset by the $331 million that we allocated for acquisitions net of cash acquired. We entered 2015 with just over $100 million remaining under our existing share repurchase plan, outstanding borrowings from our term loan of $300 million, as well as an undrawn credit facility of $200 million.","With that, let me provide our thoughts for 2015, a year in which we will continue to invest and build our platform to better serve more users and more partners. Note that we have changed how we provide guidance in light of the additional segment disclosure.","We expect full year total revenue growth in the high-20s based on continued broad growth across our product set, including a full year benefit from our attractions and restaurant acquisitions, offset by lapping the benefits from our metasearch transition, the ongoing shift of our traffic to mobile and international, as well as the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. We will not be providing our traditional product guidance moving forward. Our move towards more holistic partner relationships may eventually include solution selling and bundling of our CPC, Instant Booking, display and Business Listings, potentially causing the lines between those products to blur. This potential evolution would make it difficult to provide a specific outlook for our traditional product breakout.","On the expense side, we are expecting slight deleverage on the cost of sales line from our Viator acquisition. We expect sales and marketing expense to delever as a percentage of revenue due to increased investment in our television ad campaign, as well as international expansion in our attraction and restaurant businesses. As our segment disclosure implies, Other segment revenue is growing well in excess of enterprise revenue growth rates, and we're trading off near-term profits for top line growth and market share gains in those categories.","Rolling it up, we expect 2015 EBITDA growth in the low to mid-teens. Using 2014 exchange rates, our total revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth expectations would have been approximately 3 and 5 percentage points higher, respectively. Finally, we expect stock-based compensation, as well as depreciation and amortization, to be roughly in line with 2014 levels or approximately 5% of revenue.","In summary, Q4 was a great end to a strong year. We expanded TripAdvisor's reach within travel planning and trip taking in pursuit of our goal to make the TripAdvisor platform even more valuable for users and advertising partners alike. We will now open the call up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Two, if I may. First, just when we look at the footprint of the hotels that have an instant book option when you're within a slice of traffic that's, in fact, exposed to it, it looks like a pretty good penetration already, largely driven by what looked like small OTAs. Curious if you can just give us some color on some of the reasons why you've been expanding that slice of traffic exposed to this so slowly. And maybe, is this an issue with just making sure customers are happy, is it a monetization issue? Some color on that would be great. And then as a follow-up to that, you've talked a lot about the fact that TripAdvisor's driving a lot of bookings that your OTA customers may not give you full credit for when they measure ROI, and this is something instant book can -- a gap that can be closed through better attribution. Wondering if you can just kind of give us some color on how you think you're kind of plugging that leakage in the early tests of instant book. And then even if economics today may not be as good as they could be long term with more OTA participation, does that matter if your plugging such a big hole and leakage?","Stephen Kaufer","Very good. Thanks, Lloyd, for the 2 questions. I think I jotted them down well enough. So you're right, we have a pretty good footprint when we look at U.S. traveler demand via our partnerships with several OTAs. There's a couple of caveats on the overall rollout. We always look at a bunch of different factors. Is the pricing as good or better than what the other meta options are, where the instant book is placed on the screen, the OTA sort of partners themselves, how well they're able to fulfill the transaction and then finally, the margin. When we look at the current rollout, and we've actually just increased the rollout this week in the U.S., we think of it as a steady march forward. We've got a lot that we need to get right because we're fundamentally responsible for a chunk of this transaction now as opposed to just the Meta Lead. So as we move forward, we want more suppliers. We're looking for a broader set of OTA adoption, if we can get it. But in general, there wasn't a strict rollout plan, but we're pleased with how it's been moving. In terms of the plugging the leak notion, one of the things we're able to do with this level of rollout is measure the repeat visit effect of the folks who are seeing Instant Booking versus the folks who currently only see meta, on desktop in particular. And in that case, what we've seen is a modest uptick in how folks are coming back because of -- coming back directly to TripAdvisor because of that Instant Booking interaction. It's modest at this point. We're looking at all different ways that we're able to both improve the conversion of instant book, as well as reinforce the message that TripAdvisor is a great place, not only to research your stay, but to really come back, make sure you're getting the best price and then finish the booking. So some of that is messaging, and that just takes time. Some of that is the actual instant book rollout itself, the product feature, but all of it focuses around where the question came from, which is that effort on our part that started last year and will take place this year and beyond to plug the leak and just get fair credit for all the transactions that we're driving but get lost in the online attribution shuffle.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets.","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two quick questions. In terms of building out your presence in attractions and restaurants, that 3 to 5 year, do you do that -- do you have to build out more of a sales force in order to do that? You've done a couple of acquisitions in the restaurant space, do you need to do or are there interesting kind of shortcut acquisitions that could be done to go after the attractions opportunity? I'll just leave it at that.","Stephen Kaufer","Sure, Mark. Good questions. So we do have good sized sales forces with the Viator acquisition, LaFourchette and the companies that we've acquired since. So you can tell, specifically in restaurants, that we're not shy about acquiring supply and, in some cases, supply plus demand in newer markets. We have a long history of acquisitions in a lot of different categories. Restaurants and attractions have no reason to be exceptions. But you've also noted that, from my remarks, we're expanding in Turkey, in Sweden, in Denmark, in Belgium, and those aren't through acquisitions. Those are through organic growth. And it's not that there aren't potentially companies to be acquired, but with each country we make a decision. We look forward and we say, there's a trade-off of integration versus organic growth. We're serious about the space. We're building out the restaurant-specific sales force. That's not shared with attractions or hotels because they're calling on different customers. But it is getting to be a decent size and, certainly, continues to grow. Attractions, we bought the clear market leader, biggest, most global player in the space today. Near as we can tell, far and away, bigger than the competitive set. That's not to say we'd be ruling out other acquisitions for additional supply and\/or demand in various markets. As I said with restaurants, we have a history of doing that. But in no way shape or form should anyone view it as a requirement for our successful -- for us being successful in restaurants. Because, frankly, we look at the TripAdvisor points of sale in each country and say, \"In so many parts of the world, we are already where travelers are going to figure out what they want to do when they get there.\" And so now it's just a question of plugging in Viator's curated product and, going forward, Viator's marketplace product, which will dramatically expand the number of products online, matching it to the demand that TripAdvisor already has. And so country by country, we pick up supply in both restaurants and attractions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Sena of Evercore ISI.","Kenneth Sena - Evercore ISI, Research Division","I was wondering if you could just talk maybe a little bit more about the role of maps in all of this and how attractions come together with restaurants and just where you feel your positioning is there. And then maybe also if you could just maybe -- you mentioned better seller return, but I was wondering if you could maybe quantify that a little bit for us in terms of possibly seller ROI and maybe any updates on pricing for instant book.","Stephen Kaufer","Okay. Just jotting notes here. So maps, positioning, so sure, we have maps carefully integrated into our app. You can look at restaurants that are near you on a map on the desktop, on mobile, certainly, a lot of cross-platform. We note that on various phone devices there doesn't seem to be -- or at least no one else is reporting a lot of traffic coming from integration with maps. We find the user behavior of, \"I'm looking for a nearby restaurant. I'm looking for a nearby hotel. I'm looking for something to do.\" You go straight to the traveler lifestyle apps that you were looking for and then ask for something near where you are because all of the apps in our vertical have high-quality Near Me Now functionality. So I don't really think of it as -- if the question was along the lines of, \"Hey\" -- and on a Google or an Apple map -- \"Is that going to be the starting point for finding me a great place to eat?\" I think that's a pretty far shift for the consumer to make versus starting with a restaurant app or a travel app or something tailored for that purchase. In terms of a better selling ROI, if this is in reference to Business Listings, what we've been moving on quite aggressively in 2014, especially the back half, has been better explaining the return on investment that we've been able to quantify for quite a large number of hotel chains and independents. And by this, I mean, we count the number of clicks. We count the number of phone calls that shows travelers going from our website directly to the hotel's website. And then where we're able to, we measure the actual transactions that happen. And then we walk it backwards and say, \"What's the return on investment for a Business Listing subscription?\" We model it where we don't have exact tracking, but the modeling frequently comes out at a 5:1 return, a 10:1 return or a 20:1 return on this investment. What we've tried to do in our pricing is align the pricing to where that return is, so that it's not underpriced, it's not overpriced, but it's a fair deal. It's a good deal for every hotelier that's looking to capture some of the demand that's sitting on TripAdvisor today. And that's, in part, some of our upticks in our TripAdvisor for Business and Business Listings product is finding the better price that matches the value delivered. And the final point, instant book pricing, it's a commission model. As you're aware, as we've rolled it out to independent properties in the TripConnect beta, there have been 2 price points offered, a 12% commission and a 15% commission. We have properties, not surprisingly, that tare taking us up on both of those. The higher commission, it's a little odd to say, well, pick your commission, but when a hotelier picks a higher commission, we guarantee that they will be shown more frequently than anyone else in the instant book auction. So hoteliers looking to take control of their own demand, looking to drive more bookings directly through themselves find that quite an attractive offering. And again, it's in beta. It's just coming out now. It's rolling out slowly. We've got a lot of opportunities to scale globally, but we're taking it with a measured approach to make sure it works for all the hoteliers that are signing up.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Olson, Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Another one on instant book here. So you've got all these 40-plus partners for instant book. So there are clearly many that see it as positive or positive ROI kind of proposition. But for those that aren't using it, what is the biggest pushback that you get? Is it that the partners are concerned about missing the branding event of a traveler actually booking on their site or is it something else?","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. So first off, I'd urge you to think about the vast, vast majority of the properties on TripAdvisor are independents, and they don't even know Instant Booking exists because it's not yet available for them to connect to. So tapping into that big marketplace is a fantastic opportunity that's still ahead of us that we're still in beta in. That's the independents. The chains look at it as, hey, obviously, there's more than a handful that had said, \"Sounds good, sign me up.\" And in implementation phase, I'd say we're in interesting discussions with every chain that we have spoken with. So there's perhaps hesitation on timing. There's perhaps question marks on where this fits in the hotel's priority list. And then there's a discussion on commission. So every hotel would naturally prefer to take a booking directly on their own website, but we present a wonderful balance between -- we have a tremendous amount of traffic. That traffic is going to be on TripAdvisor and grow on TripAdvisor, we hope, in the foreseeable future. Folks looking to figure out where they want to stay that aren't yet brand loyal. And our offering to the chains is, help take this booking directly through our instant book in an affordable manner and you, the hotel chain, now have the opportunity to woo that independent traveler to become a brand loyal traveler. I wouldn't say -- I mean, as I said before, hasn't gone as quickly as we had initially hoped, but I find the conversations with the hotel chains productive, positive. And each time we're chatting on quarterly calls, we have more that we have signed up.","Operator","Our next question comes from Manish Hemrajani from Oppenheimer.","Manish Hemrajani - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Can you talk about the sales cycle, if I might call it that, to get a hotel, be it a large chain or independent, onboard the instant book platform and has that elongated or shortened? Also, can you highlight maybe 3 things that hotels are really looking for from the instant book platform? And maybe if those were addressed, onboarding would be faster.","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. So the sales cycle has been certainly longer than we had hoped, but the hotels have -- hotel chains have an awful lot on their plate these days. When we look at what it actually takes. It's a contact. It's a sales pitch. It's a commission negotiation. And then it's a -- into the development queue, which each company treats quite differently, a testing process and a rollout. So as we say, the number of signed partners is greater than the number of live partners. Those folks are all at various points of the implementation. I can't point to any specific item other than a commission conversation that is a blocker in our discussions with the hotel chains. But every hotel chain, rightfully so, is looking to address their overall distribution costs. TripAdvisor comes in, and it can be an effective way to grow their direct bookings, but it's still a distribution cost that hotel chains need to fully understand. There's a piece of the sales cycle that we recognize that we perhaps didn't fully appreciate a year ago. We're not an OTA and we're not pure media with our instant book. We're not an OTA because we're not taking the booking, we're not charging the credit card, we're not providing support. But we're not pure media because, actually, the consumer is doing the booking while they're still on a TripAdvisor page. And we're sending all of the consumer information direct to the hotel so that they're charging the credit card, they're providing the support. So it's a model that they haven't seen before, and there's a bit of, \"Well, how do we, the hotel chain, model this out? How do we make sure it's not cannibalistic to our participation in Meta?\" And we have lots of sales materials. I think our sales job -- our sales team is doing a pretty good job going through it. But it, I admit, has been taking us longer than we expect. I couldn't name 3 things to do to clearly speed the cycle that I'd be willing to do. So again, progress every quarter, but no silver bullet there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Peck from SunTrust.","Rodney A. Hull - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","This is Rodney for Bob. I just wanted to follow-up on sort of the deleveraging aspect as we go in 2015 and think about how should we think about your sales and marketing deleverage potential or leverage potential and as opposed to year 2- and sort of 3- to 5-year plans as we look out past 2015?","Stephen Kaufer","So a couple of factors. Certainly, we're expanding our TV. We've got a really exciting message to get out there to our audience. TV is a fabulous way to do that quickly. You've seen some of the branding change on the site. The \"plan, compare and book\" helps, from a positioning perspective, pull travelers back to TripAdvisor maybe after they've selected the hotel they want and now they need to compare prices. And hey, some folks don't realize that TripAdvisor is the best source out there to do that. And hey, there's an educational component. We're not moving -- to be clear, we're not moving away from our core asset of reviews and communities. But we do want to extend our brand value proposition to include price comparison so you can find the best price and the convenience of booking it once you've found that great price. So you have some deleverage that you can point to TV on. Then as we're dramatically growing the other component of the business, we kind of looked at it as, \"Hey, how does -- how would we, as stewards of this company, look at the opportunity in the attractions category?\" And we say, \"Wow, fantastic. Could turn it profitable tomorrow by a lot, if we wanted to.\" But why would we choose to do that when the growth opportunity is so tremendous? I mean, we feel so optimistic about this category because it's so big and we're the ones that can bring the demand and the supply together. We just need more inventory. With more inventory, we can both grow our organic demand and buy more demand, and then we become known as the aggregator of, hey, what do I want to do when I get there? And that feeds upon itself. We get more supply. We get more demand. Bingo. And we not only retain our current leadership position in that category, but we become unassailable over years. And then, as with any business like this, margins flow really nicely out of it because as traffic builds, especially if it's repeat traffic or organically grown traffic or app traffic, customer acquisition is nil and you've got a beautiful margin machine here because it may not be hotel-level margins, but you have a very nice margin structure in the attractions biz. In restaurants, again, proven example, OpenTable is a remarkable company out there. Terrific margins, a strong team, amazing supply in the U.S. and it's greenfield in so many other countries. And we are expanding in a number of those other countries with a different model, a bit, a different value proposition in part. But just the same, to us, a proven space that we are a leader in, in several countries, looking to expand. So again, a great opportunity to grow and secure that leadership. When we look at Vacation Rentals, there's a couple of other big players in there, which have clearly proven that the market size is large. We have our own set of demand. We've made the transition to free-to-list really nicely. That's going to be, as we indicated, a majority of our business on the transaction model, which we think is a better model than a pure subscription one. So mostly through that transition and continues to be a strong grower for us. So again, really nice opportunity. What we tried to do with some of the -- with the segment reporting is to give you some visibility into, hey, and how on the management team do we sit around and balance the investing in the core hotel versus these newer growth vehicles. And you can see in the breakout, the newer growth vehicles, we could be pulling profits, but we're choosing to reinvest in growth. Because from our perspective, it's not a question of, if the markets are there or if the markets are big enough. It's a clear answer. Yes, the markets are there. Yes, the markets are big. Yes, we have either an existing leadership position or have a strong growth position in that market so the opportunity is clearly worth chasing. Ergo, the investment philosophy that we have for that segment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom White of Macquarie.","Thomas Cauthorn White - Macquarie Research","Two, if I may. First is on hotel shopper growth. It accelerated on a slightly easier comp. I realize it's a bit early after this new campaign has been announced, but any kind of early findings there? You guys are doubling ad spend this year and the comps get easier for hotel shopper growth. How should we sort of think about that potentially accelerating in 2015? And then just on the -- sort of putting Instant Booking aside for a moment, on kind of the core meta auction, how should we think about CPC pricing kind of trending from here? That's it.","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. Very good questions, Tom. We think about them all the time. Hotel shopper growth, super hard for us to predict, some in our control, some not. All the various channels are bringing more demand to the site. We don't -- we can't talk about the overall growth. I remind you that on the TV campaign, even though $60 million is a pretty big number, we deal in a lot of markets with a lot of amazing sort of hotel shopper numbers such that the TV campaign will have an impact in hotel shopper growth, but it's kind of -- it's not one of those that we would expect to have a tremendous impact purely because of the scale at which we operate. As to sort of comps and this and that versus 2015, sorry, it's hard for us to predict. The core meta auction on CPC pricing, we predict -- or we model, I should say, a seasonally adjusted neutral CPC. So that's not to say CPCs don't go up and down over the course of the year, but when we look at this year versus a view into last year without meta, I mean, without the -- taking into account the lapping from the year before, we don't assume -- let me just start again. We don't assume that the auction dynamics will drive up or down CPC pricing going forward. So the mix will shift a bit to international if this year looks like last year. That might have a little bit of an overhang. Mobile traffic will continue to grow. Mobile revenue will continue to grow. That has a lower average CPC than desktop. So that's a bit of a kind of headwind if we're to average all of the CPCs. But when we do our modeling, we model first desktop and then mobile and add them together. And so the core question of hey, are we counting on auction trends pushing CPCs up or down? The answer is no to both. And yes, I mean, I'm not sure that there are big opportunities out there in auction land for the CPCs in travel to go up a lot. So the auction has been running for many, many years, and I think the big players have mastered the techniques of running in our auction. So I'd be surprised if there was, all of a sudden, a big uptick. I wouldn't be able to explain it.","Thomas Cauthorn White - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then just -- do you have expectations for sort of ADR growth baked into that CPC forecast?","Stephen Kaufer","No. It's a fair point. If ADRs continue to rise and conversions stay constant, there might be some natural CPC lift. It's just ADRs up or down haven't been part of our forecasting techniques.","Operator","Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan.","Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A couple of things. Steve, first, just on a higher level, can you talk more about when you think mobile could shift here from a headwind to a tailwind? How you think about that? And then as you move more toward a transactional model with instant book, can you talk more about how you ensure a good user experience on the site, how you balance that? And then, Julie, I may have missed it, but can you just mention the FX impact that's implied in the high-20s revenue growth for '15?","Stephen Kaufer","Sounds good. So mobile, when will it stop becoming a tailwind (sic) [headwind]? I guess I have a bit of a split personality on mobile because the hotel traffic, the shoppers are moving to mobile, but we have the best mobile product out there for planning a trip. And the downloads are showing that. The ranking is showing that. And everything -- every data point we can find says people are using the TripAdvisor mobile experience more than any other travel product. Therefore, we love the adoption. Consumers are liking it, but they don't monetize as well, clearly. So are they using it to do their research and then popping back to the desktop to finish their transaction on TripAdvisor? Or are they using it -- are they using the phone app and then popping over to somewhere else to finish buying something? With our instant book initiative and the fact that the app is so much more comprehensive than the alternatives, we feel that as people continue to use the app on the Trip, they get stickier and stickier with our experience. We introduced instant book. It makes that purchase relatively seamless. We're not fulfilling it. It's an OTA or a supplier, brand.com or whatever, but the convenience of doing that all in one app, the same app that helped you find the restaurant, the same app that helped you plan out your day, the app that's given you your map to get from where you're standing to where you're eating or where your hotel is, that's all part of an experience that's part of what makes that TripAdvisor planning, that TripAdvisor on-the-go something that sticks with you. Therefore, if it sticks with you, you're going to come back and use TripAdvisor the next time. So the app monetizes better than the mobile web for us. We make continuous improvements in how all of that functions. And if we can do a good job of tying mobile together with the booking piece, we feel we'll be able to both improve monetization of the app, as well as get folks ready to continue to use TripAdvisor for all of their experiences. And when I compare that scenario to a Google or to some of the other travel sites, it's just not at -- we have something that is more complete, more full life-cycle and therefore, deserves, by way of functionality, to be stickier. There was a second part of the question.","Julie M. B. Bradley","Instant Booking experience.","Stephen Kaufer","So the Instant Booking experience. Yes, clearly, in our view, much better than the meta click-off experience. The more -- and we're still in early days there. We want to present enough information in that TripAdvisor flow to make the traveler completely comfortable that they're getting the best price. They're getting a great room selection. They're getting all of the support signals that they need in order to know it's the right hotel at the right price, right location, right everything to finish booking. And other companies have had years and years of experience in that part of the transaction. We haven't. And so we continue to improve. And I tell you, the team's done a really nice job over the past 6-plus months improving that transaction flow, improving experience, giving folks what they're looking for. And we know that because we see the conversion rate continually improve month over month over month. In terms of the mobile app experience, I just love it. It's hands-down better than Meta. I can't recall seeing any feedback that says, \"I prefer a meta experience over the instant book.\" So we've got a winner there. It's still subject to people being comfortable booking their leisure trip on their phone. But our partners that have been -- our instant book partners are saying, \"Terrific, love the bookings, love the experience.\" And they call it a direct booking. And that's part of the name of the game for them is to be able to get more of those bookings. So no real concern about instant book being a problematic user experience. We just need to make it better and better in order to improve the conversion on our site.","Julie M. B. Bradley","Okay. For the quick answer, the FX impact that's embedded in our guidance was as of foreign exchange rates last week. So we try to use the latest and greatest. And that is included in the high-20s revenue growth and low to mid-teens EBITDA growth. And just from a comparison, as I stated in the prepared remarks, if we had used rates from Q4 last year, then revenue would have been -- revenue growth rate would have been 3% higher and EBITDA growth rate would have been 5% higher.","Operator","That concludes today's Q&A session. I'll now turn it back to Steve Kaufer for final remarks.","Stephen Kaufer","Great. Thank you very much. 2014 was a great year and an important year as we continue to build a bigger and more important travel business. And I look forward to updating everyone again next quarter. Thanks very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your attendance. You may now disconnect.

Please go ahead.","Will Lyons - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thanks, Chelsea. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Steve Kaufer, our CEO; and Ernst Teunissen, our CFO.","Last night, after market closed, we distributed and filed our Q3 earnings release, as well as made available our prepared remarks on our Investor Relations website located at ir.tripadvisor.com. In the release, you will find reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures discussed on this call. Also, our IR website contains a supplemental financial information document, which includes certain non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, as well as other performance metrics.

I'll summarize by saying that we have continued to make nice progress on our key long-term initiatives. As our core content and community assets continue to grow, we're investing to introduce more users to our full suite of travel products and help travelers unlock more experiences and more moments than any other travel brand.","Ernst?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, total revenue grew 1% year-over-year and growth rates in hotel and non-hotel segments improved modestly compared to our second-quarter results. We're still in the very early days of demonstrating the financial benefit of plugging the monetization leak. However, we continue to see very nice leading indicators of success, and we believe this journey will pay-off financially, but it will take time. We're moving fast, we're learning, we're improving and we believe that we are on the best path to maximize long-term growth and shareholder value creation.","With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is now open.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you so much for taking the question. Maybe with respect to the commentary in the shareholder letter on investments going forward, so you're starting to lap the impact from the U.S. launch will lap the impacts of the non-U.S. launches through 2016 and into 2017, but can you help us, give us some color of what some of those investments are that you think are key, and the scope of those investments? So we can better understand where you might invest and how it might move the needle for broad adoption of IB in the platform (3:32)? Thanks so much, guys.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Hi, Eric. This is Steve. Basically, as we continued to lap over the IB rollout, we now get to see more of the benefit of improved revenue per session as opposed to dealing with the decline. As we continue to make our conversion improvements, that allows us to invest more in paid traffic acquisition. But frankly, we've also built a better product now so a lot of the wins that we've had over the past several years \u2013 over the past year in terms of conversion flow, in terms of having better pricing in Instant Book and flexing the interface that we've talked about before. Those all come down to enabling our travelers to be able to book better and that allows us to invest more significantly in paid traffic acquisition. We're developing a better longer-term repeat user model, and we've never been shy about investing for the long-term.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions. You know just the first one, you called out some positive comments on Instant Book trends, in particularly in September. But when you look at U.S. revenue growth in the third quarter, the oldest market for IB, it looks like it slowed a bit on an easier comp, and then just kind of sequentially the revenue per hotel shopper declined from the second quarter to the third quarter on a sequential basis. So can you talk about some of the puts and takes around what's behind some of those metrics?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes. Hi, Lloyd. This is Ernst. If you look at our core TripAdvisor auction transaction and auction revenues, the U.S. actually sequentially improved quarter-to-quarter and throughout the quarter, both on revenue and revenue per shopper. And what we thought was a particularly good sign is that now in the third quarter, as we crossed the point where revenue per shopper and revenue in the U.S. was actually, first, neutral year-on-year, and now in the last months positive year-on-year. So we thought that was a very good sign because at the end of August, we were lapping the sizable rollout in the U.S. for IB last year, and we feel it's a very good news for us that we see that positive momentum year-on-year.","We saw that, we saw it combined with conversion improvements in the U.S. We saw year-on-year conversion rate improvements on the desktop IB, on meta. We saw very healthy meta-auction dynamics, we saw very healthy IB dynamics, and this gives us a lot of hope that the U.S. now we are lapping the full rollout of IB a year ago is increasingly in good shape.","You contrast that with outside of the U.S. and you see that the growth rate outside the U.S. are still negative for revenue and revenue per shopper year-on-year, as we are not lapping that rollout of IB yet, but we wanted to highlight in our prepared remarks that the U.S. is now in positive territory.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, okay. And the second if I can, just the prepared remarks implied that even in mobile app, IB is a monetization headwind. So just curious, we would have always thought that it was immediately accretive, given poor conversion rates in metasearch in mobile. So can you maybe give us a little bit more color on the unit economics of IB in mobile? And kind of how that's trending?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","This quarter, we made a particular push on the app and we went to a more dominant display of Instant Booking on the app. And that has had an immediate in the quarter negative impact, it's not the same as saying what is this a like-for-like monetization. We actually quite significantly changed the whole unit \u2013 the UI in the quarter. This had a negative impact in the quarter, but we continued to improve from there. We think that it positions us very well strategically, and we think that with changes over time we can get that to positive.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Merwin with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thank you. So in the letter, I think you alluded to the ongoing strength of meta, and I was wondering if you just could talk a bit more about how you think about the meta-business long-term relative to IB. I think in the early stages at one point there's an investor perception, correct or otherwise, that the IB business would at one point fully overtake meta, but just wanted to hear from you all if that is still sort of the long-term vision for Trip, and what these two products look like when you get to more of a steady-state for Instant Book, once you kind of lap and complete the full rollout globally? Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Chris. This is Steve. I don't think I would have ever said meta, I mean, IB would overtake meta. We've always believed, I've always maintained that meta is an integral part of our value proposition. Travelers want to come to our site, they get the phenomenal content, the information, the trust, the community, and then travelers really want to know that they're getting the best price. And meta delivers on that best price, and if the client has a brand loyalty to an OTA or to a supplier direct and they wish to book on that site, we were fine with that because meta enables that.","If the user wants to book on TripAdvisor through Instant Book, because we have great pricing, great content, then that would be a straightforward mechanism, and arguably easier on the phone because it's less of a click away. But then when we look at being successful in the eyes of our travelers, it's did we help to find the property they wanted and did we help them book it at the best price, book it on TripAdvisor or book it on our partner sites through meta. So meta remains critical. I don't frankly ever foresee it going away period, full stop.","And then the delta is just over the course of the next several years, where do our consumers choose to go? Do they choose to go into the IB flow because pricing and content and why not and they trust TripAdvisor? Well, that's fine. If they choose to go into the meta flow, we want to help them book first and foremost. We obviously recognize that if they actually book on TripAdvisor, they're more likely to come back to TripAdvisor. So we have an inherent interest in that as a flow, but it'll never come at the expense of meta going away, or at least I wouldn't ever predict that.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And operationally, we have teams focused on Instant Booking, but we also have teams focused on improving the metasearch auction. This quarter we saw nice trends on CPCs in the meta auction. We see good traction for our remarketing product. We have some other products that we're rolling out there. So meta is definitely an area where we continue to invest. It's a large part of our revenue and profits, and we continue to be focused on making sure that grows attractively.","Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Peck with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Rodney A. Hull - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah, good morning. This is Rodney for Bob. Thanks for taking our question. Two, if I could. As we think about 2017 and the company investing, again, in paid marketing channels to sort of grow the funnel, how fast or how much more do you think the shopper growth can reaccelerate to? What sort of levels are you looking at? And the second question if I might, you noted in the commentary on the vaulted credit card number. Any sense on what that number's been growing to? That would be helpful. Thanks very much.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thank you. Hotel shoppers is difficult to forecast for us. There are market and competitive forces at play. We do think that with revenue per shoppers improving into the next year, we will have an opportunity to also spend more. We also believe that spending more on marketing may not necessarily only impact hotel shoppers. It may actually help our revenue per shopper as we re-target customers as well. It's very difficult for us to say at this point what exactly our expectation for the impact is, but I do want to underline that we are aiming to affect both metrics.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Steve, I think another question on the hotel shopper growth, because it does remain at a relatively lower level versus where it has been in the past. So I suppose you can't continue to grow 10% or 15% forever, but the current level suggests that there might be some sort of a stressful change. So any details you can offer in terms of what might be happening there, especially as the consumer value proposition. The content that you have on the site remains, in my opinion, the same as before.","Also, I think you saw Priceline write-down some of the goodwill for OpenTable. I was wondering if the competitive environment for LaFourchette internationally has shifted meaningfully for you, guys. Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. I'm not sure I can add much on the hotel shopper. I do kind of reiterate a point Ernst was making in that, on the paid marketing side, when you go out looking for new traffic, you can get a combination of traffic that has not been to your site before which is an increase in monthly hotel shoppers, or you can get traffic that has been to your site before and you're buying them back in remarketing fashion.","Those remarketed shoppers aren't going to increase the total number of monthly hotel shoppers, but they are actually pretty important as we try to plug our leak. So for me, I look at the revenue per shopper and how well we are able to monetize the site a bit more than absolute percentage growth of hotel shoppers. That's just the way I look at it.","We certainly \u2013 when we look at the stats and compare them against the competition, we have a lot of hotel shoppers and several of the other travel categories are just able to monetize them a lot better than we are.","To the second question, Priceline writing-down OpenTable, well we've \u2013 OpenTable is, certainly, a terrific product. It has tremendous market share in a number of the markets in which they operate. We've seen them on the ground in Europe or see their attempts, and so we've known for a bit that they haven't been much of an impact on our business in our core countries in Europe. So the write-down wasn't informative to us.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And you'll see that in our total Non-Hotel segment, we're showing attractive \u2013 continued attractive year-on-year growth, and restaurants is definitely a positive contributor to that.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Sena with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Kenneth Sena - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you. You mentioned the focus on mobile apps and the 20% of the apps that are using a stored credit card. Can you just remind us maybe the percentage of mobile traffic that is app and also the percentage of overall traffic that is mobile at this point? Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. So for app versus mobile web, it's roughly 50-50. That would be from memory. And what was the second part of the question?","Kenneth Sena - Evercore Group LLC","Just percentage of overall traffic that is mobile?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And overall traffic of mobile, again, roughly 50-50.","Kenneth Sena - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Robert James Coolbrith - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. This is Rob on the call for Peter. A follow-up on your comments on the promotion of IB in the app. I think last quarter, you said click and transaction revenue in app grew about 50%. Wondering if you can provide an update for the third quarter? And then also, I was just wondering if you can provide some color on how the display business is performing? Any update on trends there? Thank you.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","We saw phone app users grow 50% year-on-year. That was attractive growth for us. We continue to see good traction on the app. We did comment on the monetization in the third quarter as we rolled out Instant Booking; more if you look at the underlying volume trends. They were very positive.","Sorry, what was your second question?","Robert James Coolbrith - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just any update you can provide on the performance of the display business; industry trends or anything you're seeing there?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","The display business continues to be a solid part of our hotel business and our total offering that we make to our hotels and on the site. It has continued to grow throughout this year. Not more update to give there at this point.","Robert James Coolbrith - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Perry Gold with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.","Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks so much for taking the question. Can you please comment on phone monetization relative to desktop\/tablet in this quarter? Can we assume it may have degraded a bit on a relative basis simply because meta was reemphasized in certain cases on the desktop and IB more aggressively pushed out in the app? Thanks so much.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes, it did degrade this quarter for the reasons that we outlined on the app. We have commented before that it's about a 30% monetization relative to the desktop that degraded a little this quarter. But we think longer-term, we can continue to narrow that gap.","Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nat Schindler with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Nat H. Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you for taking my question. So just to look at the basis, it looked like similar. If you're 50\/50 mobile and desktop as you say, I mean that is up from I think a third last quarter but let's just keep it at that for easy numbers. Is it roughly a 20% growth in mobile hotel shopper traffic and a near 20% decline in desktop? And if that's the case, there's any reason to suggest that, that would stop that trend? Do you see this trend continuing?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thanks, Nat. I think I may have ended up confusing folks a bit more. When I looked at the 50\/50 in my mind, I was probably considering desktop versus other. And so when you throw tablet in there, I think we probably are \u2013 probably closer to 60\/40 in traffic in terms of desktop plus tablet versus phone.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","But then if you look at hotel shoppers, that total users. Hotel shoppers is a lower percentage of phone use. It's closer to 40% the other way, 40\/60. But then we talked about those relative monetizations. So if you look on a revenue basis, you can do that, the multiplications on a revenue basis; the phone is a much smaller percentage.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","So I don't think we've seen a meaningful shift in the growth of phone over the past several quarters. So I don't think we're looking at \u2013 just in terms of adoption from desktop. So we're not calling out any particular change in any trends.","Nat H. Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So you would expect in 2017 very similar desktop traffic shrinking at similar rates as mobile traffic growing.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","It's little early to be specific about these trends for next year, but the trends that we have been seeing in terms of relative growth of desktop and mobile are likely to continue.","Nat H. Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Could you give us any more color on your direct advertising cost plan for Q4? It looks like that line was up 5% year-over-year last quarter but about 20% ex-TV. So how should we think about that as you anniversary TV? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","We're not giving any specific outlook for the fourth quarter. If you look at the year overall, we've had fairly modest year-on-year increase in our paid traffic spend. As we were indicating in our commentaries about 2017, going into 2017, we may lean a little bit more on paid traffic.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Yeah, thank you very much. Just a little bit of clarification on your last answer. Are you also thinking of going back on TV for advertising? And then I have a couple of follow-ups.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes. When we stopped on TV about a year ago, we said we would pause in 2016 and then reassess going into 2017. We're still in that phase where we are reassessing, so I don't want to make any comments yet about where we're going to come out there on TV. It's one of the options that we have been considering throughout the year for next year.","Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. And then I'm just trying to sort of do some \u2013 do my math here and just wanted to make sure I'm doing it right. If I look at the deferred revenue, looks like last quarter you did benefit from some deferred revenue from the prior quarter. How did that affect the monetization metric, if it did?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","So if you look at the revenue recognition and the impact of that, we've been describing that our \u2013 we have a seasonal impact of deferred revenues and it is impacting different parts of our business. If you look at the difference between booked revenue and recognized revenue across our \u2013 all our businesses for the quarter, it was a year-on-year tailwind of about 2% growth. If you look at currency, that was about a 2% headwind. So those two impacts sort of netted each other out for the quarter.","Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. Great. And then one last question, maybe \u2013 Steve, maybe you can answer this. But do you think the addition of another player, maybe like an Expedia to Instant Book can further improve the monetization? Or are you at a point where you think that the impact would be very, very marginal?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","I do believe the more partners that we have globally on the platform enables us to offer, if the partner has better pricing some of the time, then allows us to offer better pricing to our travelers. When we have better pricing, we have a higher conversion rate. So in that sense, a partner the size of Expedia is likely to have better pricing some of the time. So that would help our conversion rate and therefore help us financially.","Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Steve, relative to a couple of years ago has anything changed in your view of what Instant Book can do for the company over the long-term? Is it just on a different timeline perhaps than what you may have originally anticipated? And is there any view you can share on when you think Instant Book in the U.S. can become revenue accretive? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","So, it's a great question and we've thought about it a fair amount internally and we continue to believe pretty passionately that we are on the right path with Instant Book. If you look at our total usage of the TripAdvisor and the site, and of course, the app in market. And the loyalty and the appreciation and trust we have from our users globally, yet the business model is based upon doing all that \u2013 was based upon doing all that, and then sending folks off somewhere else to book. And we were missing all of the easy bookings, all of the opportunity to be the app that someone opens when they are ready to book something.","And so, with Instant Book, we've addressed that. It's absolutely taken longer than we thought, but it is a multi, multi, billion dollar opportunity as we've explained before, as we can close the gap between us and what a typical online travel agency generates in terms of revenue from these travelers. It's a huge win for us, but then that's clearly been harder, or it is taking longer than we thought has been the changing of the consumer perception.","So that they do, or they would, open up the app or come right back to the website when they are ready to finally book versus go to where they are familiar with. But as we say, we see the green shoots, we see it happening and we had projected it would happen sooner, but we still like what we see and we're very comfortable we're on the right path.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And to the second part of your question, we believe we are now at break-even on desktop in the U.S. We've made excellent progress, I described before conversion improvements, again, this quarter year-on-year on IB. Outside of the U.S., we are still some way away since we just rolled out earlier in the year, but again there we believe over the longer-term we can break-even, and then make it accretive to the whole business over time.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just a follow-up, Ernst, when you say you are break-even, you are saying you are essentially at revenue parity now with what you moved to Instant Book versus what you were doing before with meta?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes, and I say we believe because it's not an entirely scientific way of answering that question, we made a lot of changes and it's difficult to completely assess what the like-for-like would have been if we hadn't made the changes. But based on all the indicators that we do have, and the analysis that we do have, we believe currently IB is neutral to the overall economics.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks for taking my question. On Viator, it looks like online bookable activities is in the single-digit percentages of the 730,000 activities on your sites. What's been the biggest headwind for tour operators not joining online bookable? And are there certain types of activities or tours that are adopting the online channels faster?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","I mean, I don't think there's a single objection. We have an awful lot of attractions. It still takes some effort to onboard in each and every one. So we go after the ones that we think consumers want to book the most. As I'm sure you are aware, many of the attractions are government owned, they don't have an ability for us to do an instant electronic ticketing so for that, we have to wait for their use of the technology to catch up. That will be a while.","I don't view our attraction business though as being \u2013 or growth in our attractions business right now to be particularly limited by supply connectivity, obviously the more supply we have, the faster we'll grow, but we've done a phenomenally good job of aggregating up supply and now I think the big challenge is to put it in front of people on a timely basis and otherwise get the kinks out of that system.","Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","If you look at our prepared remarks, we noted that supply grew 70% year-on-year and the number of partners 60% year-on-year, we continue to believe this is a great opportunity for us to grow in a very fragmented market.","Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt with Stifel. Your line is now open","Scott Devitt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, Steve. It's understandable why the user experience and monetization have evolved as your traffic has shifted from desktop to mobile. In terms of just better understanding, and this is a follow-on I suppose to Doug's question, whether this was done from a position of strength or weakness I'm wondering whether you think the business will be better in a mobile environment at some point in time versus desktop in financial terms? Or if it's possible that the business model was optimized for desktop and that it's proving as you make this transition to be difficult to replicate that monetization? Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","I think the switch to mobile \u2013 pardon me, the move to mobile may be a short-term headwind for us as we monetize less. But it's something that is almost tailored towards where we're extremely strong which is in destination marketplace. So I can't quote specific numbers I suppose but we have way more people using the TripAdvisor app when they're on the road.","As you look to an app environment, you would suspect people will be using fewer sites and if that app-first world comes to be, you'll have to have \u2013 we'd like to think you'll have to have TripAdvisor on your phone because we're the app that's going to be used in markets so long as you know of us as a place to book, then we're going to earn our fair share of your bookings. So I think as an opportunity, the app is, or the mobile environment, the phone environment is fantastic. You can focus to a decent degree on making sure that, that full experience is a solid one, not just the bookings piece. And I think that helps differentiate us from the other travel apps you might have on your phone. So that we can continue to win the hearts and minds of travelers.","Scott Devitt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brad Erickson with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open.","Brad D. Erickson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks for taking my questions. I guess first on Instant Book, are there any other platform or technology investments broadly that need to be made in order to make Instant Book the destination that you want it to become in the future? Or do think you're now really equipped in order to drive the model transition that you've got mapped out over the next couple of years? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","I think we always have to put the lens of the consumer on when we try to answer that question. Right now, I think every time you look at the Instant Book offering and you don't see that it's at least as good a price as where you'd find elsewhere on the web, when you look at the room descriptions and the photos and you see that they're not quite as good as we can find on other sites, that's an opportunity for improvement then we have to do in order to win the conversion on that site. I think if you look at the magical secrets of the other agency selling hotels on the web, you'll find that attention to detail, making sure the consumer has the best possible price, the best selection of rooms, the content, the photos. And we are in some part dependent upon our partners, our OTA and our supplier direct partners for that.","So having more partners on board, well implemented will improve all of those things including our meet, beat, lose rates. And to be clear, our meet, beat, lose rates have been improving over the past 12 months and that's part of the reason why we \u2013 you've seen an uptick in conversion. But I think it will \u2013 there's no one big thing we're missing, one big technology investment we're missing. But I think we would forecast out steady improvement in Instant Book because of the additional supply partners that we will continue to add for a long, long time. And I'd say for a long, long time in part because there is hundreds of thousands of independent hotels out there that want to be on our platform that we would like to have on our platform that we haven't gotten to yet.","Brad D. Erickson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. That's helpful. And then could you just provide the portion of bookings that you're getting from directly linked hotel inventory versus Booking.com? Thanks?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","We don't give out that percentage. But you do have to appreciate that in order to try to teach users that they can book on TripAdvisor, we want to be able to offer the widest selection in as many languages, in as many markets as we can. And Booking.com and Agoda and Priceline brands in general have been really great partners for us on this. And so the percentage of bookings that an independent hotel, even a popular one in the United States can provide just pales in comparison to what that partnership delivers for us day in, day out. So we don't share specifics, but I can tell you the folks with the biggest supply footprint in the most languages are clearly the ones that get the most bookings.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. Just wondering if you could give us a sense \u2013 I know you don't generally go into sources of traffic, but if you could \u2013 given the changes that Google has been making, particularly to organic placement, to what degree we should be taking that headwind into account when thinking about hotel shopper growth. And then looking at the Priceline, Expedia participation, it would seem that the international side seems to be where the gap is widening the most between the two. How much of that is a function of Instant Book versus maybe some other factor that we're not seeing there?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","So I wouldn't really say there is anything new on the Google organic front search results. It remains a headwind. It's been that way for many, many years now as Google continues to put their kind of owned and operated placements ahead of what users are looking for in terms of the regular organic search results. We've grown accustomed to it and we're running our business accordingly.","To the second question on Priceline, I'd have to really defer to them in terms of whether our Instant Book could be having a bearing on their business. Point out that they have a really big international business, so impact from us \u2013 we have no visibility or little visibility, so I can't really say.","Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, guys. Phase 3 of your plan, improving the shopper experience maybe boils down to near-term monetization trade-offs to drive long-term engagement and habit, so maybe more of a top-line management dynamic there versus Phase 4, which is earning trust as the booking site of choice, which I think involves more marketing e-mail campaigns, push notifications, promotions, maybe call that more OpEx management. Is that a way to think about it? Does Phase 4 involve more granular degrees of adjustments and fine-tunings on the dial versus Phase 3? Is Phase 4 more real-time levers? Can you give us some color there?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes, Brian, the way we think about the Phase 3 versus Phase 4 is Phase 3 is really about a lot of optimization of the product, and we're very focused on that at the moment, improving the conversion flow, improving how and when we market IB versus meta to make sure we have excellent improvement in meet, beat, lose which we by the way, are continuing to improve. We continue to improve the percentage where we have room prices in IB that at least meet the price in meta.","So that's very operational product-oriented focus that we have. The fourth phase is really about changing user perception. We have traditionally been seen by users as a site that is great as a starting point to go to reviews and to plan your trip.","Increasingly, we are communicating to our users that we are also a great place to book. And that is taking time. That is a repositioning of the brand perception that we have, so that's much more oriented towards how do we communicate that improved offer to our users, which is partly done on our site and it's partly done by communicating with users that have been on our site before. More of a communication opportunity, Phase 3 more of an optimization \u2013 product optimization opportunity.","Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks, Ernst.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nat Schindler with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Nat H. Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Quickly, I don't know if you said anything on this; I didn't hear it. How much revenue was shifted into Q3 from Instant Book revenue recognition policy change or effective change?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","We've not made a specific breakout. I did say earlier on the call that the year-on-year impact of rev rec, that the impact on the year-on-year growth was 2% overall. That impact is actually the highest for our Vacation Rental business where we discussed earlier in the year we've had a shift to more and more transactions that could recognize on stay. So that 2% is an overall number. We've not broken it out further, but it's lower for the Hotel segment and higher for the Non-Hotel segment.","Nat H. Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Will Lyons. Sir, you may begin.","Will Lyons","Thanks, Ben. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to TripAdvisor's First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Will Lyons, Senior Director of Investor Relations for TripAdvisor. And joining me on our call today our CEO, Steve Kaufer; and our CFO, Julie Bradley.","As is typical, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at ir.tripadvisor.com. In today's earnings release, you'll find reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to most comparable GAAP financial measures discussed on this call. Also, please note that financial tables in our earnings release and 10-Q now reflect numbers rounded to millions.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the estimates and other forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's views as of today, May 6, 2014. TripAdvisor disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. Please refer to today's earnings release and TripAdvisor's filings with the SEC for more information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and technology and content expense are non-GAAP measures as defined in our earnings release and all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2013.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen Kaufer","Thank you, Will, and welcome, everyone. TripAdvisor started 2014 firing on all cylinders. We strengthened our content and community. We continue to lead in mobile. We're experiencing tailwinds from our recent product enhancements, and we're very excited to mark our entry into the international restaurant reservation space. I'll summarize these and some other recent developments, and then I'll hand the call over to Julie, who will provide more color on our solid Q1 financials and more importantly, our improved 2014 outlook.","On the content side, the flywheel continues to hum. We topped 150 million reviews and opinions and accelerated to over 100 contributions per minute, as members continue to engage with our platform and improve our product at record levels.","We're quickly adding more businesses to review as well with more than 810,000 hotels, inns and B&Bs and 600,000 Vacation Rental listings on our site at the end of Q1. With more than 1.4 million listings of places to stay, we are the travelers' largest and most comprehensive accommodations resource on the web.","In addition to helping travelers find an accommodation, we also help navigate other phases of travel planning and trip taking. Our 2.2 million restaurant listings and more than 420,000 attraction pages are up 90% and 60% year-over-year, respectively.","These pages drive greater user engagement throughout the travel cycle, especially on mobile devices, creating really important touch points during their trip. In turn, this is opening up attractive advertising opportunities for businesses that want to market to our massive, globally diverse community of travelers and locals looking for places to eat and things to do.","This community continues to grow at a fast clip off of a large base, as we average more than 250 million average monthly unique visitors during Q1, up 27% year-over-year, and finished March on a high note as our 267 million unique visitor count was our second-highest all time, bested only by our seasonally high August 2013 unique user count of 277 million.","So for this year, we've launched localized versions of our TripAdvisor websites in Austria, South Africa, Philippines, New Zealand and Vietnam. We now have 39 points of sale with content in 22 different languages and plan to launch 7 more countries in 2014.","Hotel shoppers, the users on our site who view a listing of hotels in the city, such as Chicago hotels, will look at a specific hotel page such as The Langham, Chicago rose 14% during Q1 despite some very tough comps from SEO wins last year.","More importantly, hotel shopper conversion: turning a hotel shopper into revenue on our site is getting better and better.","As a result, coming off of a strong Q4, CPC pricing continue -- CPC pricing growth continued in Q1 to record levels and has continued to rise in April.","Q1 showed the first positive year-on-year growth in revenue per hotel shopper since we began rolling out metasearch. We are very pleased that not only did our metasearch transition create a better user experience and deliver higher-quality leads to our clients, but now we've also demonstrated an improved economic model for TripAdvisor.","We're using these tailwinds to our advantage, reinvesting in such areas as SEM, where we can bid more to drive a wonderful growth cycle. We don't typically provide this type of insight into traffic channel trends, but it seems appropriate to do so on this call, given our incredibly strong start to Q2.","Hotel shopper growth remains the way we gauge audience growth at the top of the click-based revenue funnel. But as we continue to improve conversion in the middle of the funnel through metasearch and complement that with our new instant booking feature, we believe that revenue per hotel shopper, as well as other factors, will gain prominence in our click-based revenue model.","I'll note that we have emerged from the toughest monthly hotel shopper comps in March and April, which now start to lessen as we move into Q2 before they ease in Q3 and Q4.","We are now also comping over our meta rollout last year, progressing from approximately 25% of hotel traffic at the end of March 2013 to 100% of traffic by the beginning of June in 2013. Putting it all together, we're very pleased that revenue per hotel shopper has improved so much already, and we believe there is further upside as comps eased between now and October.","One bit of housekeeping. As our traffic grows and our site evolves, so too does the number of pages on which a user can engage with the TripAdvisor brand. For example, by reading hotel reviews and room tips, viewing photos, comparing prices and finding available properties, we have captured these pages in our hotel shopper count and have recast historical hotel shopper growth metrics back to Q1 2013 on our supplemental financial information file that was posted to our IR site today. You'll notice no material change to any quarter.","Mobile adoption continues to grow. 44% of our traffic visited via mobile devices, roughly 3\/4 of which was on smartphones. In March, the mobile traffic jumped to 47% of total.","During the quarter, we eclipsed 100 million app downloads, according to our log files. And mobile market data expert Distimo recently announced that TripAdvisor is now the most popular travel app in the world.","Our DaoDao brand also launched a new app on iOS and was chosen as one of the best new apps in the App Store in China.","I'll talk -- as I'll talk about in a minute, our strengthen -- our strengthening position throughout the travel planning and trip-taking funnel puts us in the driver seat to capture a large and growing mobile opportunity.","TripAdvisor has the most listings, the most traveler reviews, the most monthly users, the best mobile products and the most powerful global reach of any travel brand, and we're leveraging this leadership position, investing heavily for long-term growth.","One of the most exciting new channels we've -- we're leveraging to amplify our global brand is television advertising. Armed with both the successes and lessons from our test campaign last year, we have chosen a new creative partner and planning to launch new TV ad campaigns in a couple of weeks from now, in time for the busy travel planning season.","Our TV ads will initially run in the U.S. and 2 other significant markets, and we'll reinforce the notion that planning a trip with TripAdvisor will lead to a better vacation because of our community's rich and valuable insights. Stay tuned.","On the product side, we continue to innovate and make each phase of the travel planning cycle simpler and more engaging for every user on every device in every geography. I'll highlight personalization, metasearch and booking hotels and restaurants on TripAdvisor.","As previewed last quarter, we've started rolling out our new Just For You personalization feature on hotel pages. Over 15% of users looking at listings of hotels are seeing a more engaging, more personalized experience with the goal of hitting 100% later in Q2. And while it's still very early, we're already seeing a positive revenue uplift.","As for metasearch, we're winning on all fronts. It's clearly a better user experience, which leads to higher-value leads for partners and higher monetization for us.","On the user side, we're seeing increases in average time per session and repeat usage.","On the partner side, we're seeing a healthy bidding landscape for our high-value leads. Additionally, we're seeing greater partner engagement with our bid recommendation reports, tools that help them bid more efficiently and compete more effectively on our platform.","But we aren't a company that takes a break. Just as meta has turned revenue positive, we're excited to release our latest hotel booking feature, Instant Booking, which allows travelers to complete their reservation on their smartphones while still on TripAdvisor. Currently live to approximately 10% of our U.S.-based iOS, Android and mobile web traffic, Instant Booking offers users a \"Book on TripAdvisor\" button to move seamlessly through the booking process by selecting a room, inputting their personal information and credit card number, and completing their booking, all without leaving the TripAdvisor interface. This means less friction, less confusing handoffs and a much more enjoyable shopping experience.","Instant Booking is available on approximately 150,000 properties today, roughly 1\/3 of the commerce-enabled properties on our platform.","Similar to the early phases of our metasearch rollout last year, we're moving very quickly, and we expect to onboard many more partners as this feature matures.","We are excited about how Instant Booking will deliver a more comprehensive, seamless, end-to-end hotel shopping experience and could help close the monetization loop on smartphones.","Barring unforeseen circumstances, we expect to be live to 100% of our smartphone sessions in most of our major markets by the end of Q2. And we are already designing a new desktop and tablet experience in anticipation of the successful smartphone rollout.","We are very excited today to announce that we will be entering the international restaurant reservation category. We have entered into exclusivity to acquire LaFourchette, also known as TheFork for those who don't speak French. LaFourchette is the leading Internet and mobile restaurant reservation system in France and Spain, helping over 12,000 restaurants manage their tables and fill their restaurants with diners. LaFourchette has already achieved scale in these 2 large markets. They have shown they can operate at a profit while growing in the fast clip. And they are loved by their restaurant partners and diners alike.","LaFourchette is growing rapidly, and TripAdvisor can help fuel even faster future growth by turning some portion of our incredible amount of global restaurant traffic into seated diners. This restaurant traffic, which now accounts for over 200 million restaurant page views per month, will translate into more demand for existing restaurants, providing another compelling reason why even more restaurants should sign up for the LaFourchette offering.","From the TripAdvisor user perspective, we're offering the convenience of online restaurant reservations, something that both travelers and locals can appreciate. We expect to close this transaction by the end of the month and have already begun to develop a winning strategy for moving forward.","We've chartered the LaFourchette team with an aggressive mission to expand beyond their core markets, France and Spain, and we have plenty of investment capital at our disposal to put more sales and marketing teams on the ground across the European continent.","There are 2 reasons we chose to enter the international restaurant reservation space. First, this is something that we can make much bigger and better with our restaurant traffic and reviews as it is such a clear, natural adjacency to travel.","Second, the international opportunity for online restaurant reservations is extremely underpenetrated. Unlike the U.S., where approximately 20% of existing restaurant reservations are made online, this percentage is in the single digits, in some cases, low single digits in nearly every international market.","We see a clear opportunity to match our demand with more restaurant supply in more cities, in more countries, with a focus on international markets. We are very excited about entering into the restaurant reservation category and look forward to welcoming the entire LaFourchette team to the TripAdvisor family.","We're also excited to welcome 2 more teams to TripAdvisor, Vacation Home Rentals and Tripbod. Both are nice complements to our fast-growing vacation rental and trip planning platforms. We continue to actively look for great ideas, teams and opportunities to accelerate our product roadmap and enhance our global competitive positioning.","In summary, we are off and running in 2014. Our business fundamentals are strong and are getting stronger. We are delivering high profitable growth and are in the early stages of capturing huge additional opportunities.","I'll now turn the call over to Julie.","Julie M. B. Bradley","Thank you, Steve. We're very pleased to see users and partners engaging more and more on our platform, from content and community to metasearch to booking hotels and restaurants on Trip. We're well positioned for growth and are really excited about where the business is headed.","First quarter total revenue grew 22% to $281 million, with FX providing a little over 1% tailwind. On the bottom line, adjusted EBITDA growth accelerated to 12%.","Click-based revenue growth of 16% was driven by stronger CPC pricing from our metasearch leads. After reaching meta revenue neutrality in December, revenue per hotel shopper was fully recovered, accelerating sequentially from negative 9% in Q4 to positive 1% in Q1 and up from negative 19% in Q3, further evidence of a strong and increasing value of our hotel shopper leads.","Steve alluded to our continued strength in early Q2. And I am pleased to say that April click-based revenue growth was over 30%. Coming off a really strong fourth quarter and a stellar 2013, our display business saw continued strength in Q1, growing 28%. Sold impressions were up 30% during the year due to a larger, more productive global sales force, coupled with our Delayed Ad Call product innovation, which continues to differentiate our offering to a growing list of advertisers, all of whom want access to our audience of more than 250 million monthly visitors.","Subscription, transaction and other revenue was significantly ahead of expectations as well, growing 62% in the quarter, led by our 2 largest products in that area, Business Listings and Vacation Rentals.","In Business Listings, our sales team continued to roll out value-based pricing schedule that more closely matches a hotel's business listings subscription fee to the page views in bookings we generate for them.","In Vacation Rentals, our free-to-list model is helping us to increase inventory and transactions. We now offer travelers approximately 600,000 listings to choose from, up approximately 100% year-over-year. More than 40% of our listings are e-commerce-enabled, giving travelers and property owners a faster and more convenient transaction experience. Our focus remains on driving even more efficiencies in the transaction funnel.","Specific to geographic mix, our core U.S. and U.K. markets showed notable relative strength in traffic and revenue growth. Revenue to sites other than dot-coms increased slightly as a percent of total growth based on hotel shopper growth globally and strong performance on our display and Business Listings products overseas.","On the expense side, total expenses decreased sequentially from 75% to 57% of revenue, driven primarily by our selling and marketing line, due to the timing of our TV ad campaign. Expense increases in Q1 were driven primarily by headcount additions to pursue our product and global expansion initiative.","Also, while Q1 selling and marketing growth included investments in traffic acquisition, we have just started our investments in our new TV campaigns during the quarter and continue to expect to incur the bulk of our 2014 offline investment during the second and third quarters.","Moving on to taxes. Our Q1 GAAP effective tax rate was 28%, which remains a good proxy for our expected effective tax rate for 2014, dependent on jurisdictional revenue and expense mix among other factors.","We had 146 million diluted shares outstanding during Q1, and we estimate that our diluted share count will increase roughly 1% to 2% by the end of 2014, subject to our stock price movement, potential share buybacks and new share issuances.","Q1 CapEx was $20 million or 7% of revenue, driven by capitalized engineering salaries and leasehold improvements to support global office expansions. We continue to expect 2014 CapEx to be in line with 2013's exit rate of approximately 8% of revenue.","From a liquidity standpoint, our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term marketable securities increased by $75 million during the quarter to $745 million, driven primarily by free cash flow of $89 million. We have just over $100 million remaining under our existing share repurchase plan, outstanding borrowings of $330 million, as well as an undrawn credit facility of $200 million.","With that, let me provide our updated 2014 outlook. With all the positive trends that we have seen year-to-date, we are increasing our full year revenue growth outlook from mid-20s to high 20s to low 30s. Based on strong auction dynamics, we are raising expectations for click-based revenue growth from low 20s to high 20s. And we continue to expect sequential acceleration throughout the next couple of quarters as we lap the metasearch transition.","We continue to expect mid- to high-teens display-based revenue growth for 2014, as our worldwide traffic growth gives us a unique position in the marketplace and our differentiated CPM products allows us to maintain premium pricing. Note that we are up against some very strong 2013 comps, and this forecast does not include a repeat of 2013's Q4 growth rate.","We are also increasing our expectations for our subscription, transaction and other business lines from low-50s to high-60s growth, based on solid organic performance and the inclusion of the acquisitions discussed today.","On the expense side, we are tracking to similar investment levels as compared to 2013 as we invest in talented people, global brand amplification and traffic growth to capture the many opportunities in front of us.","As the continued improvement in revenue per hotel shopper has allowed us to bid more for traffic, our SEM expenses have grown with the increase in revenue. Therefore, we continue to expect to grow EBITDA at roughly the same percentage growth level as total revenue. Note that these expectations are based upon April data, historical patterns and other factors. While we intend to be appropriately conservative, this represents our best thoughts as of today.","As a reminder, our click-based revenue is highly sensitive to fluctuations in hotel shopper growth, as well as partner CPC pricing, which are risks.","Conversely, our forecast does not contemplate any meaningful lift in CPC prices or additional on-site conversion improvement from where we are today nor does it contemplate any revenue from our Instant Booking initiative, nor does it include any positive impact from our TV ad campaigns. So those represent potential upside from a traffic and\/or revenue standpoint.","In summary, 2014 is off to a great start, and it is nice to have so many tailwinds at our back.","We will now open the call up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wonder if you can just square, I guess, the deceleration in hotel shopper growth in the first quarter even on a 2-year basis with the shocking increase to guidance in terms of magnitude. Do you expect that shopper growth to kind of turn around and reaccelerate? Or is most of the guidance increase focused around price? It doesn't sound like there's much of the benefit you've kind of planned from TV. Can you just kind of help us understand the dynamics between that shopper growth number and the guidance increase?","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. Thanks, Lloyd. Perfectly fair question. So we did see a deceleration. We're finding that the business is much more in tuned towards that revenue per hotel shopper metric that we started talking about. So as we get -- I mean, if you look at the larger scheme of things that 260-some-odd million unique visitors a month, and half of those being hotel shoppers, approximately, you just -- we have so much traffic to our site already that with our focus on converting those shoppers into revenue to us and leads to our clients, it's that conversion metric that's turning out to play a much bigger deal for us. Last year, hey, as we started to lap meta, we were facing -- or we were benefiting from some great wins in the search engine front, SEO wins, as we called them. We're not seeing that magnitude of wins, but the hotel shopper number is still growing. As we look forward in Q2, Q3 onward, we're lapping easier wins on the hotel shopper number, but what we've seen in the conversion, in part from the metasearch implementation, it just gets better for the consumer. They're coming back more. They're engaged more. So it's turning those shoppers into real revenue for us much more. So in terms of going forward, I look -- hotel shopper is still the top of the funnel. It's still an important metric, but it's not the one that I'm actually looking at much more closely on a day-to-day basis. It's what's happening once those shoppers are already on our site. And as you can tell from our kind of a bullish tone in increased guidance, we're seeing a lot of good stuff, especially as we're lapping over the big meta headwinds in Q2 and Q3.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And so a follow-up, if I may, it sounds like this big step-up in guidance isn't even contemplating much of a benefit from TV or much of a benefit from the booking path. And so as we look forward, the shopper comp is about flat in the second quarter then eases in the back half. Your pricing comp eases in the second and third quarter, and you will have the benefit of the new booking path and the TV. So it seems like that's a lot of that isn't even incorporated in guidance. Is that right?","Stephen Kaufer","So we -- when we plan going forward, we assume that pricing is not going to go up. We assume it's not going to go down either. It's just called out as a risk factor. We're not assuming we're going to get amazing new wins in terms of conversion on our site because we hope to be able to make some improvement, but we're not planning a lot into it there. We're planning in nothing for TV. I like to -- after we see those wins, I'll tell you about them. But before we see them, I'm not going to put them into my forecast. So we don't count TV. In Instant Booking on the phone -- the phone still represents a relatively small amount. We think it will be positive. We hope so. It's not counted into the plan. If it was counted into the plan at the moment or early stages, it wouldn't be particularly material. So but you're right. We have some TV. We have some Instant Booking, and that could be much more material on the desktop, but neither of those are in our current plan going forward. But we are looking at the existing pricing holding. We are looking at the existing on-site conversion holding or doing slightly better. And we're just doing the math on a lap of meta from last year where the headwinds were -- where the effect was even more pronounced than what we had thought originally going into the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dean Prissman of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dean Prissman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So did Easter falling in Q2 negatively impact your hotel shopper growth? And if so, by how much? And then with your new TV advertising campaign, as you think about the objectives, how are you prioritizing the degree to which the focus is on driving awareness of realtime availability and pricing features of meta versus just broad-based brand awareness and reach?","Julie M. B. Bradley","Sure. This is Julie. I will take the first half. So the fact that Easter fell into Q1 versus Q2 was really less than 1% negative impact for us. And I'll let Steve take the TV question.","Stephen Kaufer","And on the TV question, I -- we really believe our long-term value proposition. What travelers love about our site is the ability to find the right hotel room, the right restaurant, the right things to do when you're there, to plan the whole trip. Getting a great price, that's part of it, but not the core value proposition that we will be touting in the TV ads. The fact that you'll be able to come to Trip, plan the perfect trip and get the best price that's out there because that's part of the functionality we have, excellent. But you won't see it as a direct sort of price comparison \"hit you over the head\" type ad.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I think you recently have mentioned that you have over 25 million restaurant reviews, so it makes sense that you're trying to find ways to increasingly monetize that content. I guess, is allowing for bookings to be done directly through the site the only way to monetize that? Or are there other things you're looking at like other advertising opportunities or, I don't know, deal offerings or other ways to monetize that content? And then secondly and separately, so just to be clear on the guidance, the assumption for Q2 and beyond, is that revenue per hotel shopper does not improve from here or did I misinterpret that comment?","Stephen Kaufer","I think we'll speak to [indiscernible] the later, and we may see some seasonal changes in revenue per hotel shopper going forward. Compared to last year, it's going to be great because of the meta lap. But half the revenue per hotel shopper is the actual price we're getting paid for the leads, and we're not counting on an increase in pricing from our clients. They happen but we're not counting on it. To the question on restaurants, wow, to say it's early chapter would be an understatement. So we bought a leader in -- or pending under exclusivity, a leader in Europe. And we are delighted to use that as a beachhead for our international expansion. We just have a lot of traffic that, frankly, TripAdvisor has not spent a lot of time thinking about, other than watch it grow as an asset. One of the best ways to leverage all the folks looking for where to eat. And to be clear, it's a bunch of locals looking for a place to eat in their hometown and travelers looking for a place to eat when they're taking their trips. And having an online reservation experience, both on the TripAdvisor app or TripAdvisor desktop, as well as the LaFourchette app when you're making a reservation for this very night in the town in which you live, we think that is clearly a part of our collective digital future, and we intend to be a very big player in that space. We get to bring the traffic that TripAdvisor already has, our reference point as a source of reviews, because our restaurant reviews are just very, very popular on the continent, frankly, globally, but particularly so in Europe. And so bringing that demand to the restaurants that are already signed up on LaFourchette, as well as others that will join to get access to that demand, we think, is a good picture. Long-winded answer doesn't rule out other couponing or other deals or other certificates or other ways to help our travelers dine or help locals find the best spot, but we think there's a very straightforward path to a meaningful amount of opportunity right in front of us.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. You mentioned international a few times. Does that suggest that you're less interested in domestic?","Stephen Kaufer","It simply points out that it's greenfield in so many parts of the world, and that's really where it happens to match to our restaurant demand, the traffic that we have on the site, the sheer liquidity of the reviews that we have. So I don't want to sound like it's easy because there's nothing easy in any of our businesses, but it's very straightforward, we think, to match our restaurant demand throughout the continent with the product that LaFourchette already has and aggressively encourage that team to add supply where we also have demand.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Purcell of Stifel.","Michael B. Purcell - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Steve, I was wondering if we could get a little update on the instant booking. I know it's just rolling out, and -- but I think you said it's available to, did I hear right, 1\/3 of the properties in the system right now?","Stephen Kaufer","Right. So it's available on approximately 150,000 properties. If you are a U.S. traveler using a lucky slice or lucky segment of our app traffic or if you're using our mobile web version and you're looking at a hotel in, roughly speaking, New England or Europe, at the moment, so with all those qualifications, which we round to about 10% of our mobile traffic, you'll see the book on TripAdvisor button. You don't have to hunt and peck for too much because in a short amount of time, we'll be rolling that out to a larger and larger segment until everyone gets to see it shortly.","Michael B. Purcell - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Well, great then. And so it will be a geographic rollout? And then I guess another question is, is it available both to suppliers to bid on and the OTAs?","Stephen Kaufer","Yes. We're in fact -- we've been fortunate enough to have Choice Hotels, one of the leading brands and certainly one of the most innovative and one of the most focused on the opportunity that mobile presents, to hop on board as a launch partner. So if you go to a Choice Hotel on our mobile web product in one of those geographies I talked about, then you'll see the book on TripAdvisor powered by Choice. And again, we're thrilled. We certainly expect, over time, as the product matures, many other suppliers, as well as all of our traditional -- or most of our traditional OTA partners, to hop on board as well.","Michael B. Purcell - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And did you give any timing when you think this will be 100% to the platform?","Stephen Kaufer","By the end of Q2.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente of Nomura.","Ron Zember","This is Ron Zember on for Anthony. I was wondering, the hotel shopper growth number, 14%, that you guys reported, does that include native app users on the mobile end, as well as those instant booking mobile users, the 10% that you mentioned? And then when we're thinking about hotel shoppers in general, how should we think of them in terms of the percentage of total visitors you're getting?","Stephen Kaufer","So the 14% number does include mobile app users, all devices, all geographies. The folks heading down the instant book path on TripAdvisor are, by definition, hotel shoppers because if you were looking at a hotel page, you're a hotel shopper no matter whether you click off to the meta world or go down an instant book path. So that's kind of separate. And then we say roughly half of our traffic is -- half of our overall unique users is hotel shopper traffic, roughly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom White of Macquarie.","Thomas Cauthorn White - Macquarie Research","When we think about other opportunities for you guys around kind of in-destination services or on-site purchases, can you talk maybe a bit more about other revenue models you guys could explore beyond restaurants? And in particular, I'm interested whether that might include your hotel partners for transactions at their physical locations.","Stephen Kaufer","So I'd say it's fair to assume that we will leverage the tremendous amount of global traffic that we have and the demand -- and the traveler demand that we represent and expand beyond hotels, vacation rentals, flights and now restaurants into additional activities. You could say our CPM activity already targets a number of other sort of folks in category. It's a bit early for us to say where else exactly we would choose to monetize. But just as we're super proud of the LaFourchette team and our ability to tap into restaurants now, you're correct in pointing out, we have some other traffic that is currently remaining undermonetized.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney of RBC.","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. Just to follow up on that last question about the monetization of non-hotel shopper traffic, can you be a little bit more specific in terms of the attractions, local attractions, traffic and your thoughts on monetization? Is that still -- is that skunk work, strong board, beta? Where is that maybe? And then this offline brand campaign that you're going to be rolling out the next couple of weeks, you, I guess, are relatively confident in that. Maybe that's behind some of the increase in the guidance for the year. To what extent have you actually been able to test it maybe in small local markets? Just can you help us think through how much risk there is if the TV campaign doesn't work or isn't as effective on how you try to think for that risk.","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. To answer the second question first, we do have a big campaign launching. We are -- personally, I think the team is quite excited about it. We have 0 revenue dollars associated with it. So in essence, there is no risk in the guidance we provided on the TV campaign working. There's all upside. And hopefully, we will see something material that we can measure. When we look back at our last TV campaign, we were able to see very specific lists when we were running the campaigns. We saw which markets perform better than others. We saw, to some degree, which types of ad buying gave us a better return to our -- on our investment. It wasn't successful enough for us to continue with those same campaigns in January, February, March. We wanted to retool and come out with, frankly, a more emotionally connecting message, a harder-hitting message that's going to drive to the site. And we expected -- we would expect to see a better return on our investment for that ad spend. And I'm cautiously optimistic on it, but I haven't put anything in the forecast for it. In terms of the first part of the question, attractions, I -- we do recognize that attractions have a lot of page views on TripAdvisor. A lot of money changes hands when travelers go in market and go to do stuff, tours, day trips, whatever the activities are, and travelers are relying on TripAdvisor for those reviews. We have several excellent partners right now where we send leads to go buy those attractions, and that works fine for us. But it's not as fulfilling to the traveler and we know it's not the full potential for what we can do. No timeline to announce at this point as to when and if we decide to tackle that area.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan of Cantor.","Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Steve, I want to go back to your comments about improving conversion rates on the site. And then I think Julie talked about increasing SEM spending. And if I want to tie the 2 together, is it that you're seeing an increase in conversion rate [indiscernible] spending money and encouraged to revive traffic and then maybe even [indiscernible] faster shopper growth. Is that the right way to understand?","Stephen Kaufer","I believe you're on the right track there. So as we improve the on-site conversion, we get more shoppers to actually click on the links we want them to click on, i.e., more shoppers are finding the right hotel that they're interested in buying. And we get increased pricing from our clients because the leads we're sending are higher priced than, net-net, that says we make more revenue per hotel shopper. As we make more revenue per hotel shopper, that allows us to buy more traffic through all channels on a -- we can pay an extra $0.01, we can pay an extra $0.05, whatever the number is, because we're making a bid more when that hotel shopper actually lands on our site. So it's not a change in our traffic acquisition strategy, it's just, hey, we can afford more because the site is monetizing better.","Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Right. Okay. And then on the instant booking, what's the response you are getting from the OTA partners so far?","Stephen Kaufer","So I'd say the OTAs are looking carefully at participating in the instant booking process. We're very careful when we're talking with them and the suppliers that we want consumers to understand that they are actually booking on -- they are booking while on TripAdvisor. They're booking a room that is supplied by the OTA partner or the supplier. We're very clear, as you go through the product, that questions or changes or anything having to do with the actual room purchased is a question for the supplier or the OTA. And so as the product continues to roll out, I know you'll be seeing more and more partners kind of in the store. Each works to their own time frame, and each has their own decision-making process. So you kind of have to ask them on each of those. But we're confident in our continued partner growth.","Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then you did mention that [indiscernible] to roughly 10% of the, I guess, the shoppers on mobile. What's the initial change in conversion rate that you are seeing there?","Stephen Kaufer","Excellent question. I asked the team the other day. They said, \"Oh, come on, Steve. Give me a moment. We just launched it a couple of days ago. We don't have enough data to answer that yet, 10% of just mobile times conversion rate.\" And I smiled and said, \"Yes, I'll ping you again next week.\" So sorry, I just don't have -- literally, it was just launched a couple of days ago so we don't have any data yet.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Monahan of Morgan Stanley.","Erhan Soyer-Osman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Erhan Soyer-Osman in for Jordan. I'm wondering if maybe you can touch a bit more on the CPC growth and how the pricing is driving that growth and especially maybe if you can elaborate on TripConnect and whether you think that some of these smaller hotels are making the platform more competitive and basically the auction place is what's driving that growth.","Stephen Kaufer","Certainly. Erhan, that's a very good question. So when we look at TripConnect, we see consistent week-over-week growth as the number of partners -- the number of independent hotels participating, their bid levels, the dollars we're charging. Having said that, even having a lot of independents in the store when the store has 500,000 or so different properties that are -- we call them commerce-enabled, that you can book online, even at that growth, it's still a pretty small percent of the overall bookable inventory. So while, yes, those TripConnect properties are helping drive the auction, we think of it more as a long-term play to pick up the long tail in both the Meta auction and then, down the road, the instant book platform, especially on the phone, where many of those properties don't have good mobile websites. What's driving more the pricing, we believe, is that the work we've done on our site to maintain, in many cases, improve the quality of the leads that we send downstream to our clients and then the tools that we've been able to provide that help our clients bid effectively on the properties that they are most able to pay the highest rates on. So you can kind of imagine in sort of perfect information a set of clients would bid high on the properties that they know they convert really well because they have great pricing, they have a good margin on so they can win. While on some properties where they're in a less competitive position, a different client, a supplier or a different OTA will take the high bid position. And everyone's kind of unhappy when that's out of balance, and everyone's happier when that's in balance. And from our perspective, happier clients means we're getting a higher amount of money because our clients are making more bookings. So our share of that increases. And frankly, from the consumer perspective, we're sending the person to the right place to book because the right place has the best price, and because of that conversion, they're often in the top slot. So it kind of works all around. We've seen sort of steady bid-ups on almost all countries from most players over essentially the course of the year that we've been out in Meta. And so to be clear, we're not projecting increased bid-ups going forward even at the level we're at today. It's just noticeably better than the beginning of the year and a heck of a lot better than sort of Q2 and Q3 when we first launched and had our big troughs.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs.","Heath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Steve, just curious, with the deceleration that we've seen in the hotel shopper growth over the last couple of quarters and clearly, obviously not having any impact on the rate of revenue growth, has there been any impact on that due to improvements in your ability to measure users across devices? So to what degree is it that we're just getting a much cleaner hotel shopper number? And then on the improvement that you've talked about seeing in conversion rates, would you say that there's been any sort of disproportionate improvement on mobile versus desktop as you've improved your user experience there?","Stephen Kaufer","So a couple of good questions. No, we really haven't solved the duping [ph] hotel shoppers across different devices. So no, I don't think that's playing into the equation. We have seen modest conversion or revenue improvement on the phone. We see -- magnitude-wise, it's just much more meaningful when we do any of that on the tablet and desktop, simply because that's where so much more of our revenue is coming from. So I'd say when you look at trying to match the lower hotel shoppers with the higher revenue growth, you first want to think about conversion on desktop tablet as -- and pricing that as it plays into it as the main driver.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan.","Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just first wanted to ask about Europe and if you could give any comments there in terms of macro environment, what you're seeing particularly in the travel space there. And then just secondly, you talked about pricing being up in April, but then you're sort of not building much in there. So as you go through the year, can you just talk about why you're not being more optimistic, given what you've seen so far here in terms of CPCs?","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. So I think some of the colder weather probably had a bit of a negative effect, if I were to guess as to some of the traffic that we saw on the site in Q1. April has been stronger than when we left March. So that's warmer and it's a positive sign for us. EU, in general, has been, I'd say, on the road up, whereas I was -- collectively, we were unhappy with our progress past year. It's on the recovery stream, if you will. And why haven't we built in pricing for the rest of the year? Because I can't articulate why it should be. I'm not certain that our leads will become a higher quality. So I don't know that the clients will be able to afford as a rev share or as a percentage of the booking much more. It might end up going up nicely because of instant book but still a big unknown there. And then it's just -- we provided the tools, they're bidding up. I guess you could just say I'm uncomfortable assuming something that I'm not in control of there. So it might happen, but that's up to our clients, not me.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Julie, in the past, you've been willing to give us some guidance on the level of investment that you were contemplating behind the marketing push, television, in particular. Just wondering if you're willing to do that again this year. And if the television campaign doesn't meet your expectations, would you look to deploy the funds in a different way? Or would you think that this could go back to the bottom line just -- and just be counted as a lesson? And then secondly, for Steve, I'm wondering if you could comment just broadly on user behavior. 44% of activity now through mobile devices, has this had any impact qualitatively or quantitatively on review submission?","Julie M. B. Bradley","So I'll take on your investment question. So the way we think about our business is that we are always looking to make as many investments as we can and that we see as valuable for our long-term growth. So last year, we embarked on TV advertising really to test and learn because we believe over the long term, this will be a vehicle to grow. We're taking those learnings and retooling our campaign and planning to invest this year. In the past, we've invested in other traffic acquisition initiatives, social initiatives. We measure our best success. If we don't find what's the ROI that we're looking at, we definitely have the discipline to let it drop to the bottom line. For TV, specifically, I think that we've seen other competitors, travel industries done quite well in the TV, using that as a marketing vehicle. We have a lot of headroom for brand amplification. So we are hopeful that we will enjoy successes there and look to increase our spend in the future.","Stephen Kaufer","This is Steve. On the mobile question, we look at our increasing mobile traffic as a great opportunity. So it was a headwind in terms of revenue, but we feel instant booking is going to address that. And as we look forward to user adoption buying more and more expensive things, more considered purchases being made comfortably on the phone, we're going to be in a great position because we have incredibly rich content. You can do the experience. You will be able to do the research on the phone or the desktop. You'll be able to finish your booking on the phone or the desktop. You'll be able to find the right hotel, compare all the prices, pick which one you want, book it. It's kind of a nice complete solution. And then we're the company with the best rationale for being with you throughout the trip. So plan the trip with TripAdvisor, you book the trip with TripAdvisor, you win in market and we help you find where you're going to eat. Someday, we'll help you do something even more than what we currently do in the attractions activity space. And it's kind of a full cycle. And of course, you had a wonderful vacation. You came home and we're asking you to tell your friends about how TripAdvisor helped you do everything.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak of SIG.","Brian Nowak - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I have 2. The first one, Steve, I guess in the past, you've given us rough ranges on the mobile impact, the international impact and then, ultimately, it looks like the Meta tailwind to click-based revenue growth this time. Just wondering if you could help us out kind of this quarter as to what the impact of mobile international and then Meta was in the quarter. And I have one follow-up.","Stephen Kaufer","No, we really haven't sort of broken it out this way, and I don't really look at the business in that direction so much anymore. I kind of look at it from how we take the hotel shoppers on any particular device and turn those into monetization events.","Julie M. B. Bradley","Yes. I would say that you have the key elements there of mobile and international. And I think they still remain parts of the equation. But with the transition to Meta and the tough year-over-year comps with the hotel shoppers, we've seen more of a divergence from that. So we're -- as Steve said, we're really focusing on what we can do in converting those hotel shoppers.","Brian Nowak - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then the follow-up I had, where are we now in kind of the percentage of hotel shoppers that click on a monetizable Meta link? And how are you thinking about that progressing over the course of the year in your guidance? So in another way, how many Meta clicks do you see now per hotel shopper?","Stephen Kaufer","It's a fair question. We don't disclose the particular number. It is one of the things that we look at, arguably the most important thing that we look at when we talk about our on-site conversion. Pricing, look, we try to deliver the right reports to our clients so they can bid most effectively, but fundamentally, that's their call. The on-site conversion, some of our folks that make a Meta click will make 2 or 3, but we know they're only going to make one actual booking. So our objective is to get that user to the right hotel as soon as possible to make one click because we're showing them the right place to book and be done. So in a weird sense, I make more money at the moment by getting someone to click on 6 different hotels as they compare along because I get to charge 6x for the click, but the downstream conversion, at the end of the day, they're only going to buy one property. So if I could -- if my clicks per shopper goes up, it's not clear that, that's a good thing. I could argue, the clicks per shopper going down is the desired result of our personalization efforts, where we're helping you find, really, the right hotels so you don't have to shop around as much. But the quality of that lead downstream is going to be much higher. Said another way with instant booking, our own purchase path funnel, we're going to convert that intent into a booking at a much higher rate because it's going to be kind of the right hotel for the person. So at the end of the day, it turns out to be the revenue per hotel shopper that's the best metric measured in bookings when all is said and done.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our Q&A session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.","Stephen Kaufer","Super. Let's just say, we're pleased with the quarter. We're thrilled with the way April is going. We have a lot of nice stuff in front of us. I want to take a moment to really thank all the folks on the TripAdvisor team that specifically delivered the instant booking ahead of schedule. So we said we would do it in 2014. We're pleased to have it out in May already. So thank you, entire team. And it may be a bit premature, but we look forward to the formal welcome of the LaFourchette to the family. Say hi to the Vacation Home Rentals, Tripbod. And we'll give you another update in another quarter. So thanks very much, everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","Now I'll turn the conference over to Will Lyons, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please begin.","Will Lyons","Thanks, Tyrone. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to TripAdvisor's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. We appreciate your joining us today. I'm Will Lyons, Senior Director of Investor Relations for TripAdvisor, and joining me on the call today are CEO Steve Kaufer; and our CFO Julie Bradley.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation contains estimates and other statements that are forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.

The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's views on July 24, 2012. TripAdvisor disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.","During this call, we'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share and free cash flow.

This press release, as well as other important content, is available in the Investor Relations section of our website, www.tripadvisor.com.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen Kaufer","Thank you, Will, and welcome, everyone to today's conference call. The second quarter completed a great first half of 2012 for TripAdvisor. We generated record quarterly revenue of $197 million and adjusted EBITDA of $97 million, continued to grow traffic and hotel shoppers while taking important steps to optimize traffic quality and continued growing and leveraging our social and mobile initiatives to drive user adoption. We're making tremendous headway on content collection, membership and traffic. At the end of Q2, we passed the 75 million reviews and opinions milestone and our travel community continues to add content at 50 contributions per minute, which translated to an accelerated pace of more than 25 million contributions for 2012. Marketable member growth, travelers whom we have permission to e-mail on a regular basis, also accelerated during the quarter, growing over 25% to more than 32 million, up over 60% year-over-year.","The top of our funnel, total traffic growth, also remained strong, as Q2 comScore data reflects an average of more than 54 million worldwide unique visitors to TripAdvisor sites, up more than 31% year-over-year. Further down the funnel, hotel shoppers, the key metric for our click-based revenue line, was up approximately 30% year-over-year and would've been higher were it not for a strategy change that I'll discuss in a minute. User engagement on the site was up as well, as we saw growth in time spent per session and page views per session, according to our internal log files. We attribute this growth in user engagement to our robust email campaigns and continued efforts to personalize the site experience.","In Social, we are finding great ways to leverage the building blocks we put in place on the Facebook platform. In April, we merged our TripAdvisor and Cities I've Visited apps into one app, better integrating Facebook's users' activity within TripAdvisor and allowing friends to find TripAdvisor more easily on Facebook. In the first half of the year, TripAdvisor published more than 300 million actions generated from member activity on our website or using our App into Facebook's Open Graph. In June alone, we had over 32 million logged-in Facebook users use the TripAdvisor app or be instantly personalized on the site. This traffic level makes TripAdvisor the second most popular Facebook app, according to AppData. These efforts have been very successful in terms of brand awareness, content and community building, and growing our friend-connected member base.","In addition to Social, our mobile initiatives continue to thrive as we continue to invest in and innovate on this fast-growing platform. During the quarter, we rolled out our new iPad app and introduced Facebook log-in functionality. We also launched 30 new free City Guides across iOS and Android, bringing our coverage to 50 cities. As of June 30, we reached over 22 million cumulative mobile app downloads of our TripAdvisor, City Guides and SeatGuru apps on smartphones and tablets, up more than 200% year-over-year. We also grew to more than 27 million monthly unique visitors of TripAdvisor on mobile devices in May. Further, tablet continues to be our fastest grower in terms of mobile page views, sessions and unique users and accounts for more than 3\/4 of our mobile revenue. We're obviously pleased with our mobile growth and we are focused on creating a more complete user experience on mobile, which will lead to an  even more loyal and engaged user community.","One of the more interesting developments this quarter was our traffic quality improvement initiative, which spanned the quarter and affected all geographies. We leveraged our massive amount of user, click and traffic conversion data to identify traffic that converted well on TripAdvisor but didn't convert as well on partner sites. In other words, these are visitors who browsed a TripAdvisor site, clicked on a paid link to visit one of our clients, but ultimately didn't make a booking. While we get paid for that click, we know we aren't ultimately helping our clients make money. Using this information, we reduced our SEM spend on lower-performing traffic as we believe this will increase the conversion rate for our clients. Rather than reinvest this cost savings in search marketing, we chose to reallocate some of it towards our traffic diversification efforts, including our marketing campaigns on Facebook. This initiative lowered our hotel shopper growth, which translated into lower top line revenue growth, but also drove our improved Q2 EBITDA performance. Absent this strategy change, we would have seen higher Q2 hotel shopper growth, perhaps even accelerated growth from Q1, and revenue could have been approximately $5 million to $10 million higher.","This traffic quality improvement strategy is another example of us doing what's right for the business, longer term, even at the expense of near-term growth. Whereas our site redesign last year helped improve user experience for our community, this initiative targets improved downstream conversion for our clients. We view this as a new steady state for our business as we strive to optimize and diversify our traffic sources but we can easily increase SEM spend if the opportunity arises. Despite this optimization, it's important to note that we continue to expect revenue growth in the high teens for 2012. However, our strong Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin performance should not be taken as a new run rate. We have captured just a fraction of the Global Travel market online and we remain firmly within an investment cycle focused on capturing worldwide market share.","In other key investment areas we're pleased with the progress that we made during the first half of the year, our rest of the world growth remains strong and, notably, our APAC sales team was pleased to add Ctrip to our growing list of partners in that region. In our Subscription businesses, our Business Listing team has progressed nicely on their sales force hiring plan and rolled out a new mobile upgrade product as a value add for hoteliers and [indiscernible]. Finally, we're also executing nicely in our vacation rental business on TripAdvisor and on Holiday Lettings and FlipKey.","In summary, we're tracking very well to our 2012 goals.","I'll now turn the call over to Julie, who will provide some color on the Q2 results and our financial outlook.","Julie M. B. Bradley","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter revenue increased 16% to $197.1 million, in line with our expectations. In constant currency, revenue was up 19% year-over-year. Click-based revenue was up 13% year-over-year to $151.1 million. The 7-percentage-point sequential deceleration in year-over-year growth rate can be explained by 3 main factors: We benefited from increased conversion, more than offset by year-over-year decline in pricing and the traffic quality improvement strategy; we saw increased hotel shopper conversion in Q2 relative to Q1, albeit on a slightly lower hotel shopper growth rate. Even with the unfavorable trend in foreign exchange rates, overall CPCs were stable in Q2 as compared to Q1.","We did see CPCs increase in the U.S. but this was offset by CPC decreases internationally. However, when looking at the year-over-year growth rates, sequentially, we had a tough pricing comp this past quarter compared to an easy pricing comp in the first quarter of this year. This accounted for 4 percentage points of the sequential year-over-year growth rate decline.","Finally, as Steve just described, we estimate that our traffic quality improvement strategy accounted for an additional 4 to 7 percentage points on the sequential year-over-year growth rate decline. Lots of moving parts, but the core fundamentals remained strong.","Display-based advertising revenue grew 14% year-over-year in Q2 to $26.6 million. The sequential deceleration was due in part to specific timing of ad purchases, including a unique customer buy during Q2 2011. Overall, our CPM prices increased slightly as compared to Q2 of last year. We continued to maintain a premium price in the CPM market and stable click-through rates, given our rich travel specific contents.","Subscription, transaction and other revenue, which includes Business Listings, vacation rentals and our transaction businesses, had a good Q2, growing 59% to $19.4 million, just slightly behind our expectations. In Business Listings, we continue to see a huge opportunity to diversify our customer base and develop a channel to distribute value-added products over the long term. Our near-term challenge is ramping sales execution on a global basis, such as connecting with a B&B in Vermont, while also building our relationship with a large independent hotel in Cancun, and concurrently determining the top domestic properties in Thailand.","To that end, we are catching up to our aggressive sales force hiring plan and have seen encouraging productivity metrics. We remain focused on capturing the huge opportunity we have from Business Listings, as well as growing our vacation rentals products in 2012 and beyond.","As it relates to geographic mix, despite macroeconomic challenges and unfavorable foreign exchange movement, non-U.S. revenue was 49% of total revenue during the second quarter compared to 48% in Q1 and 44% in the second quarter of 2011.","On the expense side, non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses were $63.3 million or 32% of revenue for the quarter, which is down sequentially in both absolute value and as a percentage of revenue. This was primarily due to lower SEM spend related to our strategy to increase traffic quality to our customers. We remain committed to making investments in our strategic growth opportunities and traffic diversification efforts.","Given our year-to-date results, however, we expect non-GAAP sales and marketing spend to remain under 40% as a percentage of revenue for full year 2012. Non-GAAP tech and content expenses were $19.1 million or 10% of revenue for the quarter, which is up 17% sequentially, driven by additional headcount cost and in line with our expectations. We expect this expense line to stay relatively constant on a dollar basis for the balance of the year.","Non-GAAP G&A expenses were $14.8 million or 8% of revenue, in line with our expectations. Investment in our public company infrastructure is essentially complete, and we expect quarterly G&A expenses to be relatively stable on a dollar basis for the balance of the year. Depreciation and amortization totaled $6.5 million or 3% of revenue, and stock-based compensation expenses were $6.8 million or 3% of revenue in the quarter. For 2012, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately 3% of revenue and stock-based compensation to be approximately 4% of revenue.","Our effective tax rate was approximately 31.5% for the quarter. For the balance of 2012, we expect our effective tax rate to remain relatively unchanged. In terms of liquidity, we ended the quarter with $478.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. In early May, the warrants we inherited from the spinoff were exercised for approximately $213 million. The warrant exercises were the primary driver of the uptick in our basic and fully diluted weighted average share counts for the period.","Cash flow from operations was $61.8 million or 31% of revenue for the quarter. We continue to expect full year 2012 cash flow from operations to track with adjusted EBITDA after providing for interest and taxes or low 30s as a percent of revenue. Q2 CapEx was 3% of revenue. Given our capital-efficient business model, we continue to expect this line item to remain in the low single digits as a percent of revenue for 2012. As a result, we generated $55.8 million of free cash flow during the quarter.","In terms of headcount, we ended Q2 with just over 1,400 employees, up from just over 1,300 employees at the end of Q1. Hiring efforts for the balance of 2012 are global in scale and are focused on engineering and sales. Also, I'd like to provide a brief comment on foreign exchange impacts given the prevailing macroeconomic challenges overseas. As we've mentioned in the past, we forecast FX neutral based on current rates and do not try to anticipate movements in foreign exchange rates. Just over 20% of our revenue was denominated in euros and less than 10% in the British pound. A significant move in FX would have the greatest impact on revenue as we have natural hedges to help mitigate bottom line exposure.","With that, let me turn to our outlook for the balance of the year. We continue to expect 2012 total revenue growth in the high teens. On the click-based revenue line, we are factoring in the Olympics and the continuation of our traffic quality improvement strategy as headwinds in Q3. We are also planning to roll out enhanced analytics for some of our large OTA partners on a test basis. Many of these customers have asked for more transparency in order to better understand the big landscape and in turn, increase their spend. We recognize the uncertainty this may present to our revenue results. While more transparency allows them to bid higher on their more profitable properties, it does come with a risk that clients will choose to optimize their spend without increasing revenue to TripAdvisor.","In addition, we saw strong pricing in the second half of 2011 prior to the rollout of lower Expedia pricing at the end of the year. However, we expect continued strength in hotel shoppers and lapping of last year's site redesign to more than offset the potential headwinds I just described. Given all these dynamics, we currently expect click-based revenue growth in the mid-to-high teens for the full year.","Display-based revenue faces a tough comp in Q4 based on an unusually strong demand in Q4 2011, which may not reoccur. Given this and our year-to-date performance, we now expect low double-digit annual revenue growth for display. We expect that full year subscription, transaction and other revenue growth will be consistent with our year-to-date results. Importantly, early indicators for all these revenue lines are healthy as we continue to leverage our leadership position in the market. We continue to expect 2012 adjusted EBITDA to be higher than 2011 in terms of absolute dollars based on the better-than-expected results during the first half of the year. Given the strength in our core CPC business and reduced spend on SEM, we seek to reinvest all excess profits into our strategic growth opportunities and our traffic diversification efforts. We are committed to driving long-term user growth and engagement in the business.","In closing, the second quarter closed out a great first half of 2012 for TripAdvisor.","We'll now open the call up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Nat Schindler of Bank of America.","Nathaniel Schindler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Whenever Google makes quality improvements similar to what you suggested you did and improves the conversion rates for its clients, they see almost near instantaneous improvement in CPCs because they have a very dynamic auction. Your auction is a little slower, usually takes a couple of weeks for things to flow through. Have you seen an impact from your quality improvement ceding [ph] CPCs with your clients now willing to spend more for higher-quality clicks yet?","Stephen Kaufer","We have seen, since we've been rolling out the quality improvements over the course of the quarter, we have seen some initial results from some of our clients saying that the effort has been working. As you point out, since we don't have a lot of ability for our clients to take quick action for the properties that it's working for, it is much delayed in terms of us seeing an increase in CPCs, which is certainly what we would expect. All of our tracking metrics, again with the clients with whom we can get all the way down to conversion improvements, have shown distinct benefits from the strategy that we've undertaken. And I presume we've seen a modest increase or less -- I mean a modest increase in the prices that they pay for their profitability metrics.","Nathaniel Schindler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just on the -- second question is related, as you cut off some of this lower quality SEM, where do you think you'll reinvest those marketing dollars going forward?","Stephen Kaufer","So as I indicated, we've disclosed that we've reinvested some of those marketing dollars into our Facebook campaigns. We may, going forward, choose to invest some of the dollars into some of the search engine marketing in our newer markets, where the total dollar impact is less but we're more intent on gaining trial. And I'd also add, it was a meaningful shift in the way we're conducting our SEM business and SEM is a meaningful source of traffic for us. So as the teams have now built in the new formulas, if you will, into their model, now we get to move forward and optimize on those. So you could well see -- we would hope to see us just getting better at finding the right traffic that wants to not only convert on Trip but convert all the way downstream. So, I don't think we'll be seeing a substantial additional cutback in the SEM versus now that we know the best spots to grow, we'll be able to reinvest some of those dollars in SEM itself.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs.","Heath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","As you move to add to transparency within the bidding market, I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how far you think ultimately you want this to go and what kind of impact you see it having on the number of participants, either the number of participants in the market or overall, potentially, the impact that it could have on pricing or even volatility of pricing. Do we ultimately see, over time, kind of a realtime bidding market model the way you have with things like Google Ad Words?","Stephen Kaufer","An excellent question. We're not sure yet if we'll evolve all the way to a realtime. Our customers aren't even necessarily asking for that level of information yet, but they do naturally want to know, at a granular level, at a property level, how the conversion rate, how the clicks on TripAdvisor share the market and in various bidding strategies that they can use to buy the traffic that works the best from their end. So we're going from a every couple of weeks, you can update a set of properties and looking to test out. And we really have to learn how to do this effectively, test out over time a model where we're providing our clients a lot more information. And I can absolutely appreciate how, from the client perspective, we're an extremely valuable channel to them and they would like to know how they can effectively spend more by buying the type of traffic that they want and that our current system is just too primitive, frankly, for them to be able to do so. We're approaching it gingerly in the sense that we don't have as many potential clients as someone like Google has, that could bid for words. It's harder still on our system. And the dynamic is on TripAdvisor, you're essentially mostly bidding for a dated search. It's not keyword matched and it involves a specific availability question that our users are asking in the Show Prices box. So, while everyone, of course, compares us to the Google auction that they have, ours is in one way more complicated because we have to have the date information and in one way simpler. We don't have to deal with broad matching or exact phrase or anything like that, because we're bidding at the property level, not the keyword level. Hope that helps.","Operator","Our next question is from Tom White of Macquarie.","Tom White - Macquarie Research","Two quick questions. One, with regards to the comments about traffic diversification, should we be reading that if in the U.S., you're sort of investing in Facebook but maybe the bulk of the reallocation is going to be sort of outside the U.S. to more search, that you guys are benefiting in terms of getting more direct navigation traffic here in the U.S. thanks to the branding efforts that you guys are doing with the other widgets and all the third-party distribution? And then secondly, on Business Listings, on the push there, should we be concerned about the reactions from your core OTA partners and your other Show Prices customers from the push here, particularly if you guys start to evolve the Business Listing product to stuff beyond kind of the base phone number and web URL to perhaps other types of advertising across TripAdvisor.com?","Stephen Kaufer","First, let me offer some perspectives on how we look at Facebook. For us, Facebook is -- it's an excellent branding effort. It brings in lots of members. It is extremely global for us. So that's really not at all a U.S. type initiative in search overseas. We think of Facebook as very global. We think of search in terms of brand-new markets or relatively low-penetration for TripAdvisor versus mature markets. So we'll tend to lump Europe, U.K., U.S., Canada and several others as more mature markets and the Thailand and the Poland and the Brazil as newer markets. So we tend to treat the ROI we expect on search at a different level, depending on if it's mature or new. For Facebook similarly, the advertising on Facebook, the pricing varies depending on the type of market that we're advertising in. But in general, we go very global on that platform. To the second question on reaction from the travel agencies to Business Listings, no, we're not detecting frankly any feedback worth mentioning from the OTAs on having Business Listings on the site, website link and e-mail, a phone number. That's something that I think they're very used to doing in their channels. They're always offering their benefits over to supplier direct. I presume all of the OTAs would not be very happy if TripAdvisor.star turned into a booking engine where we started actually taking the booking for a hotel room and that's really not the media model that we're looking after. So we view VL as fantastic additional channel, marketing services or independent or chain hoteliers around the globe and restaurants and attractions and other owners for whom we, literally, we're just offering marketing services. So that was a long answer to the simple question saying no, no negative reactions to OTAs for VL.","Operator","Our next question is from Herman Leung of Susquehanna Financial.","Herman Leung - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Two quick questions for you. I guess I know that seemed like there was -- investors are a bit surprised at the whole strategy change, but I understand that it's basically more for a long-term diversification. I guess can you kind of explain to us sort of the thought process, when the decision was made to change the allocation of spend more towards Facebook against Google and what are sort of some of the metrics that you're seeing away from SEM-type traffic against a Facebook traffic? And I have a quick follow-up.","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. So we've been talking for a while about diversifying our traffic sources. So search engines, as you know, are a significant source. Thank God, they're wonderful, we get a ton of free traffic, we buy a bunch of paid traffic, but we like to have other sources and it was viewed as -- we view it as into our long-term success to generate our own domain direct -- higher rate of domain direct traffic and other sources by which people are learning about TripAdvisor. From the SEM decision to kind of cut back, you can look at the revenue -- you can look at the extra dollars, the millions of dollars that we've delivered on the bottom line that was above our own expectations and make the simple case that says, hey, we just should've spent it at even 50% ROI, spending $1 to make $0.50 and we could have bumped the top line up by millions of dollars. And that's a perfectly reasonable strategy. It's not the one we took because, in that case, I'm actually spending a chunk of money and losing it on search. And we've decided that we would rather, in our mature markets, spend those dollars, some of those dollars, on the more branding and membership acquisition channels and Facebook is one that we're calling out because we're finding it's working for us. So the working is a little more harder to quantify. It's not a direct ROI spend but we're getting the content. We're getting the Facebook-connected members, which is really driving in our wisdom of friends strategy to build the value proposition beyond just a quick, hey, let me check, read the hotel review and move on. So I can appreciate how some of this may be a bit of a surprise but I hope everyone can appreciate the balance of we have a lot of profit to spend, we could have chosen to invest it, in my view, unwisely in search, which would've generated more hotel shoppers and would've generated more top line revenue but less of the type of revenue that we're looking for, less of the longer term we have you as a valuable customer going forward. So the proof will be in the pudding over the next couple of years as the membership base grows and we continue to knock it out of the park in the content and collection space. But you can see in the quarter where we've spent and I guess the final part of my long-winded answer would be we would have spent more in the second quarter had we had enough of the campaigns set up on channels like Facebook because we're pleased that we have found some things that, to our metrics, are working for us.","Herman Leung - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Great. And just a very quick follow-up. Is there a way -- I guess as we head into the travel seasonality of the third quarter, I guess have you seen linearity of the quarter kind of continue to progress higher and accelerate from a traffic standpoint?","Stephen Kaufer","Those early indicators in July have been stronger in most markets than where we were finishing out Q2. I'm not sharing any surprises. We absolutely see what we believe to be the macroeconomic conditions in Europe being a drag on our revenue growth and our overall conversion growth. Hotel shoppers, interestingly enough, are doing okay in U.K. and Europe, not as strong as the U.S., but still, frankly, pretty strong, but the conversion of those shoppers to folks that are clicking to our clients is weaker than the U.S. And then on our client side, we're still seeing a pretty big hit there in terms of ad [ph] traffic actually booking and presumably if they're booking, maybe it's on cheaper property. So we see it as CPCs that come back to TripAdvisor and U.K. and EU is distinctly hurting compared to prior year. We frankly, we have no reason not to believe it's macroeconomic in nature as people are taking less expensive vacations and shopping around more as  opposed to buying more.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Sorry to beat a dead horse here but you talked about a significant uptick in the usage of the app on Facebook and the increased spending there, while certainly, like you said, that improves brand awareness. Are you able to determine what it means for conversion? I guess what you're saying is the SEM spend drive is kind of instantaneous traffic flow but it may not be as high of quality. So maybe what's the lag in the traffic growth in conversions from lower quality SEM type traffic versus Facebook traffic that maybe higher quality?","Stephen Kaufer","Yes, hard for us to know the long-term answer to that question. Certainly, most of the SEM traffic that we buy in most markets interacts with the site. Depending on the type of keyword, they have a nice long session and read tons of reviews. Other times, they just do a quick price compare and depart. When they read the long reviews, we love it. We feel we've got a great brand impression and we presume that customer comes back more frequently than the one that just did a quick price compare and out the door. In most cases, we don't have a member at that point. We had a visit. And that's great from trial but less good from a long-term perspective. What we're doing on Facebook, it's almost the reverse. It really is not generating immediate revenue at all for us. It's not generating a lot of traffic to the site immediately, at least from the Facebook side of things. But it is generating a member that is interacting with our site or our app, our Cities I Visited app, who's generating content for us. We have an e-mail and we know who their friends are. So we're sharing the ratings, the reviews, the tips, the whatever across a broader set of people. So again, it's building up that Facebook-connected members that now hear from us every week, in whatever language they speak, almost. And we're able to tell them what their friends are doing. And we believe, and it will take a while to prove out, that those members upon seeing their friends interacting with TripAdvisor when they're ready to plan their next trip, come on back and do it on the site that they've been hearing about and that their friends are using, TripAdvisor.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And then from a geographic perspective, would you say you saw any weakness in any particular market, like any headwinds from the broader challenges in euro macro environment that we're hearing so much about or not really?","Stephen Kaufer","Well we distinctly hear -- see our numbers demonstrate challenges specifically in Europe and U.K. And again, we see people still being interested in travel but even on our site, they're converting less into clicks. And when they get to our client sites, in general, they are converting, we believe, at a lower rate, perhaps in some combination of buying cheaper stuff, all of which we see back as lower CPCs. So again, we're really happy with what we're doing in the U.S. and in some of our newer markets, Australia, but we do derive a fair chunk of business in Europe, U.K. and folks are suffering there.","Operator","Our next question is from Anthony DiClemente of Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A few quick questions. First one is can you give us a sense of when, timing-wise, you began some of these quality improvements in the quarter? Has it been a constant rollout or was there a discrete time when you started this?","Stephen Kaufer","Yes, I'd say pretty early on in the quarter. I'd say at this point, it's kind of getting better. It was tested early on and we found that the conversion rates we got from some of our clients was demonstrating what we have known. And so we continue to roll it out. At this point, I think of it as fully rolled out. And we didn't really know. At the end of Q2, it was a theory and as we tested it, maybe by the end of April, at that point, we had a pretty good idea that it was working.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Second one is just wondering, to what extent, and maybe this is more relevant to Julie's comments about CPC trending, but to what extent is mobile having an impact on CPC dynamics?","Stephen Kaufer","To the extent that we do believe some of our traffic is -- I can't prove it, but we believe that some of our desktop traffic is moving over to mobile and our customers are not behaving the same on mobile, mobile being phone, then no doubt we're losing some clicks. It's hard for us to know whether the amount extra that we're gaining in all of the user engagement, all of those millions of users that are picking up the phone and using TripAdvisor are then coming back to the desktop and doing their bookings there. We've just started to roll out functionality that allows you to save something on desktop and see it on mobile and vice versa, but the percentage of our audience that uses those features isn't enough to do a decent job tracking the follow through.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Last one for me, Steve, the quality initiative that you articulated in your remarks and on the call, it seems like a very well thought out intelligent strategy to me. I think one question investors might have is, at this early stage in your life cycle, I think folks have been measuring your success and evaluating your progress by looking at revenue. And so to us, it now seems like profitability is becoming incrementally of greater importance. And so when I look at your guidance and your targets, they're mostly revenue based. So I'm just wondering if should investors really should start to weigh profitability and margins a little bit greater in looking at TripAdvisor? And if so, do you expect to be giving a more granular, more detailed profitability or EBITDA targets for us with respect to guidance?","Stephen Kaufer","A fair question. I don't quite look at it that way, because I say, hey, as I look at the bottom line numbers, if we came in $5 million above what you've thought on the bottom line, you know that we could have bought an extra $5 million to $10 million on the top line. A monkey could have done that, just not that challenging because we know SEM. So you can adjust the top line, bottom line. I'm looking at it from a long term, I need to get better at SEM so that I'm spending, efficiently, buying the traffic that not only converts on TripAdvisor but really helps my clients. So we embarked on that program to a degree we had more success with the front end piece of getting the right traffic to our site than we had on the spending piece to diversify the traffic. So you should still, I'd urge you to still look at, hey what's the top line? How's the growth of the company? How are our hotel shoppers doing? What's the conversion rates factors, frankly because our margins, in our view, are already outstanding. And then when there's a lower than you might've thought on the top but higher on the bottom, hey, you can do the math and put it in reverse. And in a similar way, if we blow out the top and I'm coming in below what I might have said on the bottom, you get the right to ask, saying, hey, did you find some great investment vehicle that you're taking  a bottom line hit on in order to grow top? And if I find one of those, I'm more than happy to explain it after the fact.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Devitt of Morgan Stanley.","Scott W. Devitt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I had a follow-up on mobile. You've done a great job with the app downloads. So I was just wondering if you do have a specific monetization strategy for mobile or if you view it long-term more as an engagement mechanism as you kind of highlighted in the answer previously? And then secondly, I was wondering if you think the improvement in traffic quality and the transparency that you're providing to partners in terms of how they should bid, if that's going to require just an incremental tech platform spend and if so, if you could quantify that?","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. So doing the second one first, yes, we're putting a couple of additional, I'm not sure yet how many engineers against that particular project. But we're talking a small handful. So it's nothing that would be noticeable in any of our lines in terms of building out that bidding system. Again, most of our clients primarily just want the information in order to be able to bid in a smarter way. So it's a small resource allocation from my perspective. To your mobile question, we absolutely do look at mobile as a revenue stream down the road. We continue to stay focused first on engagement but we see the in-market opportunity as being potentially meaningful down the road as we get to offer better marketing services to the restaurants and attractions that are in market versus the hotel purchase, which is the absolute lion's share of our revenue stream now. There's some internal debate as to how much online booking TripAdvisor is going to be a part of in the very front end hotel research experience, just because on the phone, the screen is so darn small are people going to want to review the information that TripAdvisor has versus their tablet. And so to the tablet point, hey, we think tablet will mimic desktop and most of the strategies we have on desktop will be just as applicable on tablet and tablet could even become better as the user demographics of folks using tablets probably spend more than on desktop, in general. So short answer is at the moment, it's more engagement and functionality but we do believe that mobile will become, a phone will become a much more interesting revenue stream for us in the outgoing years.","Operator","The next question is from Chad Bartley of Pacific Crest.","Chad Bartley - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Looking at the year-over-year growth trends in your non-Expedia revenue, we saw a slowdown of about 10 points. I wanted to ask, is that really a function of the traffic quality initiative that we've talked a lot about and then the tough pricing comparisons? Or is there anything incremental or different going on that contributed to that slowdown?","Stephen Kaufer","I suspect it's mostly around the geographic mix. So as we already talked about, sort of Europe is a bit of a challenge and we're just very global in terms of where our revenue's coming from. So don't know a crisp answer to you but I think I'd point in that direction with some combination of the traffic quality piece, I'm sure.","Chad Bartley - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","I was partly wondering if there's any sort of update that you can provide as it relates to other advertisers, other OTAs now that we're 1 quarter further way from Trip becoming a standalone public company and potentially increasing their spend. So is there any update around that?","Stephen Kaufer","Yes, I mean -- absolutely. The update is I've met with -- personally met with many of the big clients, all our account managers have met with all of our big clients and the message is just loud and clear to us, hey, we would like to be able to spend more on your platform. Nothing to do with corporate ownership stuff. Just give us the information so that we can optimize our bid strategy, so that it can be a win-win. And we've heard some stories from our clients that talk about, hey, we tried to spend more on the test but it didn't work and we don't know why. And the answer in these sorts of environments is always well, in this part, you did make more money, but that part, you didn't, and our system isn't transparent enough to let them optimize on the plus side and revert on the negative side. And we've recognized that. We've told some of our major clients that this is coming. We're not  secret about it. We just haven't gotten to everyone necessarily. And it's in sort of we will be rolling it out in test mode because we do believe, our clients or many of our clients are adamant that if we provide them more visibility, they are absolutely ready to increase their spend. And that's why we call it in test mode as opposed to full mode because we haven't done it before. But we do think that there's more dollars there.","Operator","Our next question is from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan.","Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just wanted to ask about 2 things. First, on CPCs. Can you just talk about the overall outlook for 2012 relative to the flattish that you previously have stated? And your thinking there about the potential lift from quality changes and sort of offsetting the macro pressures that you're seeing. And then also, if you could characterize how you're thinking about the environment as it relates to algorithmic search results for you guys. Would you say that things are sort of fairly stable in terms of what's happening on the natural results of Google pages?","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. Two good questions. So the CPC outlook, I would, say we did have some tougher comps, though when you look Q1 to Q2, it was basically flat, if I'm not mistaken, even though we had the CPC declines in Europe offset by CPC growth, pricing increased in the U.S. So you look at them and say, we think what we're doing, were it not for the macroeconomic climate in Europe, would be sending CPC prices higher across the board. And again, they're strong in many regions. We think that, that does have to do with our site redesign changes from last year, the quality improvements that we made on our SEM traffic this past quarter certainly contributing and just some other pieces of the site personalization efforts that we feel are driving higher qualified traffic to our clients. So going forward, I'm not going to be able to offer any prediction on the travel climate in Europe. Generally, when we forecast, we take the position of, all right, next quarter is going to have the same mood, the same FX, the same everything as what we have today. So if you guys are betting things are going to get better, then that will help us. If it's going to get worse, that will hurt us. We believe ourselves to be reasonably sensitive to the overall economic climate. To your second question, algorithmic search results, we haven't seen much change by way of what Google's done in the past quarter. We don't think anything has affected us in a meaningful way. Certainly, we're pleased that we continue to have growth in our SEO channel, across, I've got to believe, all major markets. But we would absolutely expect that as the cycle of content creation has grown in all languages. So again, we get more content, more freshness, better results from the user. Google favors sites that offer better results. We're one of those, so we tend to rise in the rankings. I haven't seen, to give a follow-up to your question, haven't seen Google Places or Local, whatever they're calling it now, come out with any particularly interesting new features that we think are pulling traffic away from TripAdvisor. So again, stable. The integration they have with Zagat does appear more in the search results. Again, more on restaurants than hotels, so less meaningful to our business.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Mahaney of Citigroup.","Mark S. Mahaney - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just one quick follow-up question on the attempt to the goal of improving the quality of the traffic to declines with the customers that seems very straightforward, but what's driving that and to what extent have you -- has there been a decline in the conversion and a decline in the quality of those leads that you've been delivering? Is there something that clients have noticed, OTAs have noticed and have brought up to you or is it that you've just looked across your marketing channels and discovered just a better mousetrap?","Stephen Kaufer","We did see some indications from some of our clients about a decline in traffic. I mean a decline, I'm sorry, in conversion of our traffic. Where we get good data from clients on conversion, of course, we'd like to act upon it and make an intelligent conclusion. When we sliced and diced and said, hey, why is this conversion going down? In certain markets is understandable, but other markets, it wasn't. And we've seen good growth in our SEM traffic year-over-year, sort of 2011 over '10 and '12 over '11. And so one of the things that we found when we sliced and diced is that some of the traffic that we were buying on SEM, and as I've said before, sometimes we will buy on a barely profitable basis in a mature market. We can appreciate how by buying a word at $0.50 and someone comes to the site and they click around, visit pages and then we sell the qualified user to our partner for $0.49, then I've bought a profitable visitor. I'm happy to do that all day long. The profit isn't much but it got me trial and that was a successful event for us. If it turns out that, that visitor, upon going to our client, actually bought something at only 1\/2 the rate of our normal traffic, then it turns out that, that click to the client wasn't really worth $0.49 on average. It was only worth $0.25. Wait a minute. I paid -- I think I might've said that wrong but I paid. . .","Julie M. B. Bradley","$0.48.","Stephen Kaufer","Yes, if I bought the traffic at $0.49 and I sold it to my clients at $0.50, but it was really worth $0.25 because it converted at 1\/2 the rate, and I ended up buying it at $0.49, selling it at $0.25 and I actually lost money on that SEM transaction. So that was part of the dimension that we discovered. And it's not like it was a bad thing for the business in general because we got someone to give TripAdvisor a try. They had a successful experience. They read a review, presumably, they went off and clicked on a client site but they didn't convert as much. And maybe it's because of this particular keyword that we were buying or the experience that we put them through as they landed on TripAdvisor. So our Q2 efforts, and I'm sure this is way more detailed than you were looking for, but the Q2 effort was really, hey, let's not buy as much of that traffic because it's not really meeting our objective of being, for that mature market, being profitable on every click that we're buying. So we let go of some of that traffic and are choosing to reinvest it elsewhere.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. I think you told us that the comScore data was up 31% and that your hotel shoppers was tracking with that at about 30% year-on-year growth. Wondering if you could give us some regional color there and maybe compare and contrast mature markets with international growth markets and, specifically, Asia. And I have one quick follow-up.","Stephen Kaufer","Good fair questions. I'm not sure how much of those numbers I have at my fingertips. I can give you the hotel shoppers we're growing. Between U.K., Europe, U.S., U.S. kind of grew the fastest in terms of shoppers and revenue, in fact. U.K. and Europe were kind of tied in terms of hotel shopper growth but meaningfully less than what the U.S. was growing at. So from that, you can absolutely -- I haven't told you the rest of the world.  I don't have that handy here, but I can tell you that U.S. grew faster than the 31%, than the 30% that approximate number and that the U.K. and the EU was less. A bit more important than the actual hotel shopper growth is how those shoppers turned into revenue, which was a much more dramatic shift. So the U.S. was significantly above our year-on-year growth numbers compared to the average and EU and U.K. was significantly below.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Any color on China?","Stephen Kaufer","China, from a sort of overall CPC number still isn't meaningful enough to substantially color the overall averages. I look at China less from a, hey, are CPC's up or down in that part of the world than how we're doing on overall reach? How we're doing on the site engagement metrics? Are people sticking around longer? And we've cut back on some of our spend as we've done a few things to improve the product, adding Ctrip. Hey, that's a big win in that market. They're not on [indiscernible]. They don't play in too many other channels but we've got them on board and that's probably with the most, if not all of their inventory. And that helps our user experience. And it adds to our bottom line or top line but at the end of the day, it just delivers the visitor to DaoDao more choice and that's the most important piece of it for us right now.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Nowak of Nomura.","Brian Nowak - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I have 2. First one is on kind of just going back to Europe for a second. I was wondering if you can talk about kind of the European conversion and how it kind of trended toward the quarter and now, because you're heading to July and August, I mean, is it getting any materially worse or is it kind of just been a steady, this lower rate of conversion since the beginning of the year?","Stephen Kaufer","I see the conversion -- in Europe, I'd color it as mostly steady in terms of it wasn't good in Q1 and it may have fallen a bit in Q2. I'm hesitating only because I'm not sure if I'm looking at kind of all of the numbers synthesized. So I don't want to convey a misimpression for you. Sorry about that. So because of our on-site efforts with personalization, I think that Europe actually converted to clicks outbound a little bit better but probably got hit worse on the pricing side as prices kind of went down more in the second quarter.","Julie M. B. Bradley","Yes, we saw a steady decline in pricing in EMEA throughout the quarter.","Stephen Kaufer","There we go, a definitive answer.","Brian Nowak - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And the other question I wanted to ask is on the hotel shopper growth. Can you help us a little bit just kind of, in 2011, what was the 2Q '11 hotel shopper growth? And then, how did that trend through 3Q and 4Q of last year?","Stephen Kaufer","I don't have those numbers with me, so sorry. I just don't think I can answer that. I'm trying to just think back to what was happening in the second half last year and I don't think there were any surprising big growth shoots. So I don't think on the hotel shopper side, we'll be facing any tough comps in terms of the shoppers. The comps will all be around pricing, because of the Expedia [indiscernible] and the small [ph] pricing before that and then the conversion, which will help things along because we'll have lapped that in Q4.","Julie M. B. Bradley","Exactly spending [ph] redesign.","Stephen Kaufer","Redesign [ph] , sorry.","Brian Nowak - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So no changes at all as Google changed its strategy in kind of the back part of summer last year with Places?","Stephen Kaufer","Yes, I don't recall having a big places impact in the back half of the year. There's always something but I don't think -- well I can say we haven't modeled an increase, a meaningful increase in hotel shoppers in the back half of the year based upon a particular weakness in the second half from last year.","Operator","This ends the Q&A portion of today's conference.

Total revenue grew 29% to $363 million or 36% growth on a constant currency basis. On the bottom line, adjusted EBITDA grew 4% to $127 million or 15% on a constant currency basis. This quarter's business performance was slightly ahead of our expectations and keeps our full year outlook intact.","Our first quarter illustrated two important trends that position us for profitable growth for years to come. First, our core hotel business is strong, growing, and very profitable. Click-based revenue grew 20% or 27% on a constant currency basis. And second, our newer attractions, restaurants, and vacation rental businesses are growing even faster than the core. These businesses, while highly seasonal, contributed nicely to our revenue growth this quarter. These near-term financial results were strong and speak to a solid global travel backdrop.","Now let me turn to our key initiatives and start with how we are expanding our lead in content and community. Listings grew 19% to 4.9 million businesses with pages on TripAdvisor, including 16% growth in hotels, 25% growth in attractions, and 19% growth in restaurants. We're seeing record user engagement as well as evidenced by reviews and opinions growing at 45% to 225 million. And users are contributing at an accelerated rate of 139 per minute, which is 39% faster than last year.","In addition to reviews and opinions, users are also contributing ratings, helpful votes, saves, tags and a wealth of location information at a massive scale, helping us to innovate, streamline, and personalize the TripAdvisor experience across all devices. This metadata underpins our unique understanding of travelers, helping us deliver better product to our users and more targeted insights to our partners.","On the partnership side, we're pleased to be one of Google's initial launch partners for customized voice action through the Google app, where users can say, okay Google, show attractions near me on TripAdvisor and be directed to our app. Users will also be able to find our content when they are using Apple Maps. Both integrations highlight that, on any device, TripAdvisor has great answers to the most frequent and fundamental travel queries. Where do I want to go? Where should I stay? Where's a good place to eat? What should I do?","Not surprisingly, having the most valuable travel content on the web attracts the largest travel audience on the web. Traffic growth accelerated for the second straight quarter, growing 31% to 340 million average monthly unique users. Hotel shopper growth accelerated for the second straight quarter as well, up 26%.","Another area of strength and deep engagement is mobile, where our top ranked apps have been downloaded 190 million times, including 170 million downloads of our top-ranked TripAdvisor app. We believe organic downloads and user engagement on mobile apps is a powerful indicator not only of brand strength but also that consumers view TripAdvisor's mobile products as an indispensable tool. Our continued outsized traffic growth speaks to our global reach. As we reinforce our leadership position in travel media, we're in the early stages of expanding our position to help more users transact with more businesses on TripAdvisor.","In hotels, we expanded Instant Book's reach in Q1. On the user side, we were pleased to introduce the booking feature to some mobile phone users in the U.K., Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand. We're honing a more seamless booking experience on TripAdvisor and we're working hard to enable all English-speaking countries.","On the partner side, we're currently working with over 50 OTA and hotel brand clients, including 20 that are live. Q1 was also the first full quarter of our Instant Book beta for independent hotels. We're live with more than 70 connectivity partners and thousands of independent hotels currently taking bookings on our platform. Early feedback continues to be very positive. I'd be remiss if I didn't call special attention to the extended Instant Book team, which is working tirelessly to bring our Instant Book product to more users and more partners. I thank them for their continued efforts.","In attractions, the teams make great progress in improving the planning and booking experience for users and partners alike. I'm very pleased to announce that at the end of the quarter, Viator began the official rollout of the Viator Marketplace, which will enable us to rapidly expand the number of bookable listings within the 530,000 attractions on our site.","Most importantly, Marketplace will give users more choice, be it to book things like a helicopter ride over the Grand Canyon, a skip the line pass for the Louvre, or a private tour of Machu Picchu, which in turn should drive more bookings for more partners and a bigger and better business over time.","On the TripAdvisor side, our team completed a refresh of the attraction pages, giving users a cleaner and easier way to plan and book things on their trip. We're really excited about how attractions fit so well for users and our business.","In restaurants, our listings, content, and traffic are all growing nicely. From the business development side, we are executing on our organic and inorganic growth strategy, which is building value for more users and more restaurant tours. We're investing organically to expand our new restaurant platform, TheFork, and recently expanded into the online reservation market in Sweden and Turkey. We're growing through acquisition as well, adding Portugal-based BestTables to the TripAdvisor family during the quarter.","We've seen enormous opportunity to leverage our content advantage, deep mobile engagement, and 2.7 million restaurant listings around the world to match more travelers and locals with more restaurants.","Last, but certainly not least, we're building a bigger and better vacation rentals business helping more users find and book great properties on our platform. Listings growth reaccelerated to 18%, and we now offer more than 700,000 listings. For some trips, the vacation rental is a better option than a hotel and free-to-list is helping us offer as many high quality listings as possible.","During the quarter, we also finished a significant migration of our inventory onto one platform. While invisible to the user, this has enabled faster inventory onboarding, making it easier to deliver more options to choose from. We're seeing the financial benefit as transaction revenue grew 200% and accounted for more than 50% of our vacation rentals revenue in the quarter.","In sum, the year is off to a great start. We've opened an exciting new chapter for our business, building upon our leading content to enable more users to plan, compare and book their hotels, attractions, restaurants, and vacation rentals on TripAdvisor.","As I conclude, in addition to thanking our employees for all of their continued hard work, I also want to thank Julie Bradley, who announced that she's stepping down as CFO after almost four years. Julie has been instrumental in guiding the company through the spinoff, building a world-class finance organization and has played an important role in positioning the business for the long-term. She's been a great partner in building TripAdvisor and I thank her for her contributions. Thank you, Julie.","And now, here's Julie.","Julie M. B. Bradley - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to start by saying a few words about my decision to step down as CFO. My decision is a personal one based on my desire to spend more time with my two great teenagers before they head off to college. This was a hard decision for me, because of how much I love TripAdvisor and all the people I work with here. In particular, I can't thank Steve and the rest of the management team members enough for their friendship and support; it's a great team. I'm confident that TripAdvisor's best days lie ahead and I'm excited about the path they are on. It feels like a good time for this change. The business is doing well. The foundation is solid. I have complete confidence in the finance team and I plan to stay with the company through September or until we find my successor to ensure a smooth transition. I also want to thank our shareholders for their partnership and support.","Now on to the financials. TripAdvisor turned in a strong first quarter despite the U.S. dollar continuing to strengthen. First quarter total revenue was up 29%, driven by our large and growing click-based business as well as a full quarter contribution from lafourchette and Viator. In constant currency, our revenue growth would have been 36%.","Q1 click-based revenue grew 20%, or 27% on a constant currency basis, driven by 26% hotel shopper growth and very strong CPC pricing for our high-value leads. Revenue per hotel shopper growth was negative 5% for the quarter. Absent currency headwinds, revenue per hotel shopper growth would have been slightly positive, a great result as more than half of our traffic growth is coming on the phone which monetizes at a fraction of desktop and tablet search devices.","Display-based revenue grew 9% in the first quarter against the tough year-over-year compare. We continue to improve our data management platform to deliver more value to a growing global list of marketers, including both travel and non-travel sectors. Our performance in this product category continues to well outpace industry growth rates. Subscription, transaction and other revenue grew 88% for the quarter, driven by contributions from attraction and restaurant acquisitions as well as by great organic traction in vacation rentals. Q2 should remain an easy comp in this regard, and then we expect growth to normalize as we lap these acquisitions in the back half of the year.","Consolidated Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $127 million, an increase of 4% or 15% on a constant currency basis. Beyond these currency headwinds, these results reflect negative contribution from our attraction and restaurant acquisitions due in part to their revenue seasonality, which is heaviest in the summer travel months as well as our aggressive investments to drive global scale.","From a segment perspective, our core hotel business remained strong, posting 20% revenue growth or 26% in constant currency with a very solid 41% adjusted EBITDA margin. During Q1, we invested more than $10 million in television advertising to amplify our 'Plan, Compare, and Book' consumer message. We plan to step-up this investment in Q2 and again in Q3 to deliver our message into new and existing markets heading into the heavy summer travel planning season.","Other segment revenue grew 187% in Q1, primarily driven by attraction and restaurant acquisition contribution as well as vacation rentals. Other segment's adjusted EBITDA margins were negative 12% for the quarter due to ongoing organic investments and high revenue seasonality in attractions and vacation rentals. On this last point, I'll again remind everyone that these transaction-based businesses have revenue that is heavily weighted in the summer months as we recognize revenue when the ticket gets used or the stay occurs. However, their costs are more evenly distributed throughout the year.","As we outlined on our last call, we are executing on a three year to five year growth plan in these newer categories, leveraging our strong core hotel business to fund global expansion. Near-term, our priorities are simple; drive revenue growth and market share gains. We believe adjusted EBITDA margins should improve over time as these businesses achieve greater global scale.","Moving on to head count, we ended Q1 with nearly 2,900 employees, up 38%, driven primarily by our attraction and restaurant acquisitions as well as our ongoing investments to attract top tier talent. For taxes, our Q1 GAAP effective tax rate was 27% which was in line with our projected 2015 GAAP tax rate of 27% to 28%.","We ended Q1 with 146 million fully diluted shares outstanding and we estimate that our diluted share count could increase roughly 1% to 2% by the end of 2015 subject to our stock price movements, potential share buybacks, and new share issuances. We generated $99 million of cash from operations during the first quarter. CapEx for the quarter was $31 million or 9% of revenue, driven by leasehold improvements for our new headquarters, capitalized website development, and, to a lesser degree, data center expansion to support our traffic growth. This amounted to $68 million of free cash flow in Q1 or 19% of revenue.","A quick note on CapEx. This should decrease as a percentage of revenue when we take occupancy of our new corporate headquarters in late Q2 or early Q3. As such, we continue to expect 2015 capitalized expenditures to be roughly 5% of revenue. From a liquidity standpoint, our cash, cash equivalents and short- and long-term marketable securities increased by $48 million during the quarter to $642 million, driven primarily by free cash flow. We have just over $100 million remaining under our existing share repurchase plan, outstanding borrowings from our term loan of $290 million as well as an undrawn credit facility of $200 million.","As it relates to our outlook, our business has performed well year-to-date amidst worsening FX headwinds. As such, we continue to expect full year total revenue growth in the high-20%s and EBITDA growth in the low- to mid-teens. I'll remind everyone that we forecast on an FX neutral basis, so future changes to FX could impact our 2015 outlook.","On the EBITDA side, given the timing of our offline marketing investments, the high seasonality of revenue and our growing transaction businesses and a full quarter's cost structure from our attraction and restaurant acquisitions, we expect Q2 adjusted EBITDA year-over-year growth to be flattish, before a strong step-up in the back half of the year. This will include $20 million of TV advertising spend, which is roughly $10 million more than what we spent in the second quarter of last year.","In summary, we've had a solid start to the year. We're hitting our near-term objective as we continue to lay the foundation for long-term growth.","We will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, guys. First question just in terms of Instant Book. Can you kind of give us an update from a consumer standpoint, what you're seeing in terms of click-through rates, and ultimate booking conversion downstream when you're putting an Instant Book option in front of user instead of a metasearch option, and kind of how that compares on a supplier-direct versus OTA?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure, Lloyd. This is Steve. So, the click-through rate what we've always been pleased to report and can reiterate is that when we put a button up there on either the phone or desktop, tablet devices, that says book on TripAdvisor, consumers are fine with that. They click at roughly the same rate as if we are putting any other brand. So, our interpretation of that is perfectly happy to leverage the trust that they have in TripAdvisor to start down that booking funnel.","We don't disclose the actual conversion rate or we're not ready to disclose the actual conversion rate of those leads but you can imagine as it's been rolled out on the phone in so many places and being out there that it's working well for us and the rollout continues as you've seen in my remarks into other countries on the phone. On desktop, we haven't rolled it out fully but we continue to work through both the downstream conversion. We continue to work optimizing the funnel. And just to make sure that the user's experience is as good as it can be, as good as it should be whether the filament partner is a supplier direct hotel, hotel chain, or through an OTA.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then, I guess, following up on that, do you still feel like you have the necessary sales footprint to build hotel direct supply using the existing business listing sales force or do you think that it will require more people to kind of get it where you want it to be?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","I'd say we continue to grow that group but whereas a couple of \u2013 many years ago when I talked about having to build up a full sales organization to go reach all of these hotels, we don't need another one of those. We're clearly on the path of leveraging the one that we have and when we've seen signups from individual properties come straight through our website with very little by way of a touch of a sales rep. For an independent property \u2013 or I should say, for a chain property, we already have the key account infrastructure in place. For an independent property, the switch from a subscription or the addition from a subscription to a commission rate is quite well appreciated by the independent. So we expect modest growth, but nothing that \u2013 nothing involving rebuilding an entire sales force.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys. And Julie, good luck and enjoy the time with your family.","Julie M. B. Bradley - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thank you, Lloyd. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just following up there. Steve, you've talked in the past about sort of the education curve, helping partners understand Instant Booking to lead to broader adoption of it by some of the big hotel chains, some of the partners, I know you'd like to sign up. Maybe give us a little bit of color around where those conversations sit, how they are evolving and what people want to see as part of that education curve to get more comfortable with the product long-term? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure, Eric. And another excellent question. So, the education curve for the big chains, I think kind of the under \u2013 most of them understand what we've \u2013 what we're doing here. I'd say there's general buy-in and an understanding as to why we're doing it and how we can help them. There is an ongoing negotiation in terms of how and under what terms do they want to participate. So stay tuned is the message. I don't think more education is necessarily the answer as opposed to closing more on the negotiation side.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Peck with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Robert S. Peck - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah, thank you. Congratulations. I want to ask about hotel shoppers, which had a great growth rate here, about 26% or so, off of a little bit of an easier comp. Julie, I was wondering if you could talk \u2013 how should we think about that number going forward here through the rest of the year? Thank you.","Julie M. B. Bradley - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. Thank you for the question. So we don't forecast overall hotel shoppers. We see we're very excited with the growth, especially given that it is off a very large base.","Robert S. Peck - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Two things \u2013 first, just on meta pricing or just overall click-based pricing, can you talk about the increase that you saw in 1Q just on an FX neutral basis? I may have missed that, but then also, kind of how you're thinking about that going forward and perhaps the room that's left there in terms of meta pricing? And then, secondly Julie, can you just clarify on the 2015 guide very clear that you're maintaining the reported numbers. Did you provide what that would be on an FX neutral basis? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","So I'll take the first...","Julie M. B. Bradley - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Okay.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","...on the CPC and then float it to Julie. So, I guess I would suggest that the auction as it currently stands is in fact being a reasonable representation of the value of the leads, except as best that our clients can track it. So we have always maintained \u2013 continue to maintain \u2013 that we're missing a big chunk of credit for the transactions that we're driving, but as the tracking is currently implemented by basically all or almost all of our clients, the last touch attribution to get technical, we're getting the credit and our clients are paying a fair price in the auction. So, as the CPC reflects the competitive nature of the auction, we don't expect \u2013 we have no reason to expect \u2013 CPC prices in particular will meaningfully go up or necessarily go down as we don't see too many of the auction dynamics changing over the course of this year.","Julie M. B. Bradley - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. And then I would take the FX guidance related part of the question. So, early in Q1 at a conference, we stated that looking at our guidance, it's included about a 5% revenue headwind and 10% EBITDA headwind as compared to the comparable quarter throughout 2014. Since that time, we've probably seen about a 200 basis point further deterioration in rates, but we are still comfortable holding the guidance that was set out originally.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Heath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. Steve, you've talked a lot about sort of the demand from larger hotel chains for Instant Booking and what they see as being an acceptable rate or commission for that \u2013 or partnerships \u2013 where they're willing to sign-up in the current travel environment. Curious how that's evolving, if you're starting to see as Instant Book matures, any nuance to the attitude that they're taking towards adding Instant Book as an option and whether that's different in Europe versus the U.S. and large chains versus smaller?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. Good perspective to add. I'd say there's general sort of a faster reception amongst the smaller chains, in part they \u2013 it's a bit of an easier decision for them or another distribution channel. The bigger chains, I would characterize it as good and material progress, forward progress, in the discussions with most of the big chains and I remain optimistic that, that one to several will continue to \u2013 will sign-up and we'll be able to publicly announce those.","Heath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom White with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Tom White - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. On Instant Booking, I was hoping maybe you could provide some details about how you guys are sort of internally modeling or forecasting the monetization of Instant Booking this year, sort of what kind of impact from that product is kind of contemplated in the full-year revenue outlook. And then just secondly, there's been a lot of M&A in the space recently, maybe just some high-level thoughts on what that means for you guys, I guess there's sort of a trade-off between maybe more revenue concentration, but maybe to these newly acquired brands kind of are they going to perform better under their new owners and if they convert better, maybe have more margin to spend in marketing? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. So, with Instant Booking, it certainly is a challenge for us to forecast that. In terms of monetization, we play the long games, so it's not just a questioning of getting to revenue neutral or slightly above or slightly below. We're taking our best guess over the course of the rest of the year as to when we think we will roll out and how much, but as you know some of it's not in our control in terms of \u2013 not entirely in our control, in terms of the timing of some of the chains coming onboard. So the short answer is when we look at it going forward, we're not projecting a major financial hit by an Instant Book rollout, that's something that at least at this point we're not choosing to do.","In terms of the OTA and the M&A landscape and the impact on TripAdvisor, the Expedia, Orbitz deal is not closed. If one assumes that it will, then we \u2013 and if I were to guess or hypothesize on what Expedia may do, so I want to be clear that not sharing their potential plans with us, one might guess that they would take a bunch of their inventory that they have excellent margin on and put it onto the Orbitz platform and Orbitz would continue to bid it on TripAdvisor, that's at least the history of what they did with Travelocity. As they did that with Travelocity, that was kind of a net positive, I believe, for TripAdvisor, probably a net positive for Expedia as they had another well-known brand that could bid on our leads and given that in general I think with Expedia's having slightly better margins than Orbitz, they would then be able to bid higher if they chose to.","So all of that's, obviously, completely outside of our control. But when we looked at that acquisition, we think it would be a neutral to perhaps a modest positive to the auction dynamics on our site. Most of the auction dynamics is in the first two slots of the meta landscape and the first two slots tend to be the biggest brands and that tends not to be in Orbitz or Travelocity. So it's \u2013 that's why I'm reasonably sure it won't be a meaningful change, at best it would be a modest one.","Tom White - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks for the color.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Manish Hemrajani with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Manish Hemrajani - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking my call. Really solid traffic growth this quarter. As higher traffic visits the platform, how well is that incremental visit are converting? Is it similar to what you've seen before or is it converting at a lower rate than your existing traffic? And then, hotel shopper growth was up 26% and traffic growth was up 31%. Are you starting to see more traffic growth on a non-hotel side? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes. In general, we do see more growth on the non-hotel side, just there is a lot more restaurants, there is a lot more languages that we're expanding on. And I would project that to continue in the future as we're big in restaurants and restaurants is often a very local use case on the phone. We would expect that to continue to grow and, for obvious reasons, much faster than hotels, that's kind of why we do breakout the hotel shopper number versus the total traffic. So if I were to look and forecast on a total revenue per unique user, yes, we expect that to continue to going down, that's kind of our modeling, our planning. And it's not a bad thing to have the constant or the incremental traffic growth even in the segments that we don't monetize particularly well, restaurants in Japan for instance today. But you can see as we move our booking capabilities into restaurants and attractions and expand them globally and expand them in multiple languages, that's a way for us to tap into that traffic growth that's not in the hotel segment. So we're by no means ignoring that growth, but it will always \u2013 for the foreseeable future be a lower monetizing consumer than someone who's shopping for a hotel.","So, better or worse than historical, I think because of the shift to the phone and a bunch of our hotel shopper growth is coming on the phone, and the user experience is delightful, excellent, all nice engagement metrics, but the likelihood that that consumer is going to finish their booking on the phone is dramatically less than the desktop. Therefore, the revenue per hotel shopper on the phone much less than on desktop, which brings down the average of revenue per hotel shopper over time if you just look at it through a device lens. Obviously, we're making up some of that on a combination of pricing and conversion, and getting higher quality traffic into the hotel shopper funnel on desktop to make up for the downward pressure on the phone.","Manish Hemrajani - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Sena with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Kenneth Sena - Evercore ISI","Hi. Thank you. Just a comment, Julie, you made about revenue per hotel shopper and the fact that on an organic basis you're actually seeing a slight increase there. Can we infer from that \u2013 I'm sorry \u2013 can you hear me okay?","Julie M. B. Bradley - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes, yes.","Kenneth Sena - Evercore ISI","Can we infer from that maybe that the mobile headwind is starting to subside a bit, as we look forward, thinking about modeling that ratio?","Julie M. B. Bradley - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. So, Ken, my actual statement was that revenue per hotel shopper was down in this past quarter but if you look at it on a constant currency basis, not...","Kenneth Sena - Evercore ISI","Okay, not organic. I'm sorry.","Julie M. B. Bradley - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah. So, if we just take that, then it was actually slightly up, which we were pleased about it.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","The mobile headwind will continue and because there's still such a gap there, it's really up to us, the company, the team to be able to make up for some of that headwind, frankly, as we did this past quarter through other means on the desktop plus some improved monetization on the phone but it's still a headwind for what we've seen for quite some time.","Kenneth Sena - Evercore ISI","And can maybe you give us some sense of what the change would have been on an organic basis?","Julie M. B. Bradley - TripAdvisor, Inc.","So, revenue per hotel shopper should be all organic because the acquisitions that we've been making are in the restaurant and attraction space. And the way we defined hotel shopper, if someone who's coming to look at a hotel page, either a hotel listing page or a hotel detail page, as compared to our restaurant and attraction customers who are coming to look at those specific pages.","Kenneth Sena - Evercore ISI","So the increase then would be the same whether it's you're talking about ex-currency or you're talking about organic, correct?","Julie M. B. Bradley - TripAdvisor, Inc.","So, there is no difference between organic and total when it comes to revenue per hotel shopper because we do not make any acquisitions that were in the hotel segment.","Kenneth Sena - Evercore ISI","Okay. And so, as we think about the improvement \u2013 I know that Steve mentioned that you still have that gap that you have to close, but clearly you improved this quarter. So as we look forward how can we think about that ratio trending? Does it get better from here do you think or is there still some erosion to expect?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah, I'd say it remains a challenge for us each quarter and we can make progress on the rev per hotel shopper both by better monetization on the phone through things like Instant Book and the successors to that, the continued rollout, as well as the users are getting, we believe, travelers getting more accustomed to booking on the phone. So we're not in control of that but it's a trend that we see and we expect which will improve conversion rates just through time. And then, the additional ongoing conversion improvements that we've gotten good at that we need more of on the desktop, all of which to compensate for the headwind of the general shift over to mobile.","Operator","Our next question...","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Hard for us to model, harder for you to model.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen & Co. Your line is open.","Kevin C. Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. Could you comment at all on the rate parity investigations of OTAs that we're seeing in Europe? How do you expect to see that situation developed and is there any impact on TripAdvisor's business? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. So we do follow it. It's kind of not really of top concern for us. People do come to TripAdvisor; they look at one of the values that we provide. All of our customers has the ability to use us to shop around for the best rates. So, to the degree, to which rates do become more diverse over more segments or more different channels, that makes the price comparison engine more valuable. To the Instant Book side, it makes us work harder to make sure we're getting the best rates on our site so that our own Instant Book option isn't being beat by some other channel. So, in general, we're fine with it, we don't currently model in any business benefit by that change and honestly if it happens I'm not sure we'll ever really know that that \u2013 if we see a benefit, it will be relatively impossible for us to tie it back to that ruling or those changes that will follow.","Kevin C. Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Steve.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure thing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nat Schindler with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. If your line is on mute, can you please un-mute it?","Jason S. Mitchell - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Sorry about that. Hi, this is Jason here for Nat. I was kind of just wondering if you could kind of talk us through how you think Instant Book might affect meta rates more in the long-term picture? You talked about the top two slots being the important ones and if meta is the first button, do you expect that to pressure rates? And then, on mobile, you're rolled out more with Instant Book on mobile than you're on desktop. Are you seeing an early signs of breakage being cured by that? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Hi, Jason. Two good questions. So, I don't see \u2013 personally, I don't see the Instant Booking pressuring the meta rates. Our clients in general bid for kind of the most they can pay or the most they choose to pay for the traffic. Instant Booking simply means there is less traffic available to the other players, but we don't \u2013 it would be very hard for us to be able to measure that there was an impact \u2013 and logically it's a little hard for me to see that there would be an impact.","In terms of \u2013 on the phone \u2013 is the breakage being cured. Look, we do see a repeat rate on the phone. Is it because people are getting more used to using the phone and if they flow through booking, it's better they come back? Yes. Is it because IB offers a really nice convenient experience, so they come back to use IB? Yes. What's the breakout between the two? Really hard for us to say.","As evidenced by the full rollout in the U.S. and the more aggressive rollout in other countries on the phone, we like the experience, we're committed to it, we're rolling it out. We're not in a must roll it out next week, but it's a train that there's no stopping, so we will continue that over the course of this year.","Jason S. Mitchell - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks for that. And then, just going back to the hotel shopper growth, you had like a 1,200 basis point easier comp and you accelerated 300 basis points this quarter year-over-year. Can you just \u2013 was there anything in Q1 of 2014 that we should be aware of for that comparison?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","It's a good question. I don't put a ton of stock in the quarter-to-quarter hotel shopper, so yes, it was lower a year ago. When we look at 26% this quarter and 20% something last quarter, those are great numbers of hotel shoppers coming to the site over and over and over again. So again, if next quarter it's a slightly lower number or a slightly higher number, it's just a factor that goes into the revenue. We're working off such a large base, and as I said before, what's going to get lost in some of those numbers are the number of hotel shoppers that come back within the same week or within the same month, which aren't counted in these growth rates.","So, again, growth rates slowing a bit \u2013 I mean, acceleration is always a great thing \u2013 but slowing a bit is not, in my mind, a sign of an issue. It's really what we can do with those shoppers and we've had some nice progress in that area, even in a situation where it's been in a growing quarter.","Jason S. Mitchell - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Julie, a question long term about the potential margins for the non-hotel business, could you give us a sense of where those could shake out as those different segments scale?","Julie M. B. Bradley - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. So, we are definitely investing for the long-term. We see huge market opportunity. Just looking at the restaurant space, for example, there's a lot of greenfield opportunity throughout the globe. There's public comps that are out there that are very profitable. And as we understand what that business could look like at scale, but because of the large opportunity in front of us, we have the luxury of using our very stable, growing profitable hotel business to expand into these adjacent areas. So as we continue to do that, we most definitely will see profitability over the long-term and it's just a matter of timing and when we get a complete penetration and mature business model.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And it's not a specific number I can offer, but we do point to the fact that in restaurants, it is a very local product and there tends to be a winner take all or a close to it in a given city. Because if you get enough restaurants and you have enough user demand and enough app installs, that's very habit-forming; you go back to the app. And in almost all of these businesses, it's a cost of customer acquisition that drives the margin, and when you can get that cost of customer acquisition down to be zero because it's a repeat user, the rest of the business just turns out margin.","When you look at attractions, it's less a winner take all because it's a more episodic purchase as with travel in general. But, we already have the website that's the closest out there in terms of where people would go research what they want to do when they're in market, when they're planning a trip. And we have far and away, to our thinking, the largest number of installed apps with great attraction content with 170 million TripAdvisor apps out there growing at a wonderful rate.","So, you take all of that, then you think of Viator as the OTA for attractions, selling a product online that's not shipping a good but ticketless just like a hotel or package list; it's just an electronic ticket. That needs a bunch of information to sell it. We have that information. That needs the connectivity to be able to deliver the inventory, the tour or the ticket not unlike a hotel reservation, and we're in a very good position, we believe, to be a able to satisfy the demand that we know is out there.","I mean, focus already quantified that at the $60 billion, $70 billion, I forget the total number, but it's a really big number that already exists. You don't have to imagine anything else happening, it's just scattered over huge number of vendors including a ton of kind of walk up or last minute purchase. And so if our destiny \u2013 if we can hope for our destiny to be that online travel agency for attractions then TripAdvisor brings the demand, Viator brings the supply, and it's a pretty nice match on a product that sold online with high margins, gosh, looks very similar to the hotel space and we all know a couple of OTAs in the hotel space that are very big and very profitable. So, we like those \u2013 we like those proof points.","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you, Steve.","Julie M. B. Bradley - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And, Mark, I just want to jump, I know you asked for the long-term, but I just want to get in there a little bit about reemphasize the short-term, especially when it gets to \u2013 comes to Viator and that it's a highly seasonal revenue stream just based on the way that we recognize revenue. And just to give you a sense of how significant that is, about 10% of 2015 Viator's total revenue was recognized in Q1. And we expect Q3 will recognize about 40% of the total. So pretty significant swings throughout the year and often you should when looking at overall EBITDA margins and remember that their cost structure is evenly distributed.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, guys. Maybe some additional color on mobile, Steve, you mentioned the improving mobile monetization rates. What are the trends there in terms of narrowing that monetization gap, what's kind of driving that? You mentioned some improvements were driving that. And then any unique insights from the Samsung pre-installed relationship? Is that extended to the newer models also? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","So, I don't think I can comment on the Samsung stuff at this point. The mobile modernization, I'm not sure I can point to anything specific. Obviously, we believe the Instant Booking is a positive factor, just more general usage is a positive factor. And the team has done a nice job just making the app easier and easier to use. And it's kind of hard to point to a single thing but it's getting better and better, and therefore monetization getting the traffic that comes in to the right hotel, and therefore generating some revenues from us \u2013 or for us either through Instant Book or meta.","Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Naved A. Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Yeah, hi, thanks. On the business listing side, what portion of the business listing customers have you migrated to property-based pricing versus the flat-fee structure that you used to have?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","So, quite a while ago we had a pricing, I mean the business listing pricing has gone through a number of evolutions. There used to be pricing that was more geographic and focused with different tiers and then over a year ago, it went to sort of property-specific pricing. So, at this point, I would say almost everybody \u2013 a bit of a guess but I would have to guess almost everyone is on property-specific pricing now. So there wouldn't be any other changes \u2013 a number of properties have seen the price go up, as we've kind of right-sized it for the value that we've been delivering in terms of clicks and page views and overall visibility.","Naved A. Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Understood. And then, on the \u2013 in the restaurant business \u2013 do you see more M&A opportunity on the transactional side such as lafourchette or do you think there are equally compelling opportunities to acquire review sites to increasing your \u2013 the depth and breadth of your content.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Review \u2013 restaurant review sites?","Naved A. Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Yeah. So M&A opportunity between transactional businesses such as lafourchette or acquiring review sites.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","I mean I'd say we are an acquisitive company, so we look at a wide range in restaurants and, obviously, outside of restaurants. I think if you looked at the acquisitions we've done, they've been more focused on the transactional side, but you won't hear me ruling out anything else.","Naved A. Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Two quick ones. Steve, you mentioned the additional countries that are now seeing some availability of Instant Book. Is it possible to size the percent of queries that are now seeing Instant Book or the percent of hotel shoppers who are encountering that option? And then, secondly, wondering if you could provide any color on your efforts in China? Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure, so I can't really size the percent of hotel shopping queries that see Instant Book, I'm not up to speed myself on the exact rollout of what we're currently seeing in different markets and it does fluctuate. U.S. is a big market and Instant Book is available on lots of properties there. So, it's certainly easy to find if you're looking for it. In China, it is a huge market. It remains a fast growing market. It is super-ultra-competitive and when we look at our efforts to-date, we have to acknowledge ton of hard work by the team, good product, good efforts, but and I have to say sort of status quo is not what we're aiming for here.","We're not winning in the way that we wish to and so from \u2013 the team has \u2013 in China has come back and said, hey, here's a set of things that we need to do differently to succeed in a particular space within the China travel landscape. Outbound travel, you can see on the site is a particular highlight of ours and it does in fact resonate with Chinese travelers, because we have a phenomenal amount of international content. And while we have every hotel you could want to stay in, in China, the strength of us versus the competition for the Chinese traveler we feel it plays to our strengths focusing on the outbound. So, you can see a bunch of that on the site today and I can simply hint that more change to come over the course of the year.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Is \u2013 can I quickly follow up, is content creation going okay over there?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah, I'd say I view that both through the lens of, look, do we have the restaurants and attractions and hotels that we need so people can review them and are they placed accurately on a map, that sort of thing. Do we have photos for them? And the general answer is, yeah, I think we're doing pretty well there. And then do we have local language reviews for things that the Chinese traveler wish to see domestically and internationally? And that's a build for us. We're pretty strong there. So we don't view our \u2013 we don't view the situation as only if we had another X amount of reviews we'd be fine, we're looking at a more \u2013 kind of a bigger shift to target the specific audience for whom we have a clearly winning content and commerce play compared to the competition.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, Steve.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today\u2019s program is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s program, Will Lyons, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Will Lyons","Thank you, Jonathan. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to TripAdvisor\u2019s second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. I\u2019m Will Lyons, Senior Director of Investor Relations for TripAdvisor, and joining me on the call today are our CEO, Steve Kaufer; and our CFO, Julie Bradley.","As is typical we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at ir.tripadvisor.com. In today\u2019s release you\u2019ll find reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures discussed on this call.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that the estimates and other forward-looking statements included in this call represent the Company\u2019s views as of today, July 23, 2014.

I am going to first touch upon some highlights and recent developments and then, I\u2019ll hand the call to Julie, who will provide more color on respond Q2 financials and our 2014 outlook.","Total revenue growth accelerated to 31% driven by our strengthening click-based revenue business. On the bottom line, EBITDA growth accelerated to 14% inline with our expectations. During the strong first half of the year, we continued growing content and community as well as innovating of products and platforms to make TripAdvisor even more valuable for consumers and advertisers alike.","We continue to grow our leaders world\u2019s largest travel brand for travel content as we toped a 170 million reviews and opinions on 1.5 million listings of places to stay, 2.3 million places to eat and 450,000 things to do. New user generated contributions continue to grow more than 100 per minute making TripAdvisor a better research and planning tool every minute for every user.","Monthly unique users grew 25% to 280 million during Q2 and more than 1.25 billion unique users visited TripAdvisor sites and apps during the first half of the year. More than two-thirds of our traffic originates internationally and then the second quarter we launched five localized version to work with TripAdvisor website in Austria, Israel, Finland, Hungary and Vietnam. With the addition of the Czech Republic launched earlier this week. We now have 43 points of sale with localized content in 26 different languages.","As we reinforce our strength at the top of the research and planning funnel we are leveraging the significant assets for community to match more consumers with more businesses driving higher conversion and more profitable bookings for our advertising partners. This is most evident in our strengthening click-based revenue business, which we accelerated to 28% growth driven by continued healthy pricing in our metasearch option. Revenue-per-hotel shopper growth accelerated for the third straight quarter to 11%. Hotel shopper growth during the quarter, we accelerated to 17%.","As we stated on our last call, hotel shopper growth remains the where we deal to audience growth at the top the click-based revenue funnel, but as we continue to improve conversion in the middle of the funnel through metasearch and complement that with our new Instant Booking feature, we believe that revenue-per-hotel shopper, as well as other factors will continue to gain prominence. One of that positive revenue-per-hotel shopper growth is an important trend, since it allows us to bit more favorably in pay traffic acquisition channel into drive further traffic growth.","We are contemplating \u2013 we are complementing our historical strength in online advertising, but in television app released in May in the U.S., Australia and France. Our key message is that TripAdvisor helps make every experience, every destination better as in don\u2019t just go to Paris, go to TripAdvisor Paris.","We\u2019re very pleased with the early results from this campaign as we think Google Trends data shows a meaningful uplift in these three markets for branded search. Equipped with the new-media strategy we are excited to address our large opportunity to increase unaided brand awareness. Based upon our results to date, we will continue investing aggressively in TV through October of this year and expect to expand this channel next year.","On the product side, we\u2019re leveraging our unique understanding of the traveler to continue to innovate and make each phase of the travel planning cycle simpler and more engaging for every user on every device and every geography. Specifically we\u2019re very pleased with the early results from our Instant Booking initiative.","On the user side, 100% of U.S. smartphone users now see a Book on TripAdvisor button that allows them to seamlessly complete their hotel reservation within the TripAdvisor experience. We expect to introduce a similar book on TripAdvisor option to U.S. users on desktop and tablet later this quarter. The product is driving value for Instant Booking purpose today as our early data indicates that hotel shoppers are converting at a higher rate through the Instant Booking funnel as compared to metasearch.","Our focus remains on growing property and geographical coverage by onboarding more OTAs and suppliers. We recently added Best Western to our partner list. We expect them to be live later this quarter, and we have several more client integrations currently in development.","Additionally, we have commitments from over 50 Internet booking engines that want to become Instant Booking partners and help the clients, the independent hoteliers leverage our open-booking platform. We\u2019re very excited about Instant Booking and believe this user enhancement will significant long-term benefits for our business.","Instant Booking is just one of the many exciting recent mobile developments. We continue to innovate by reducing friction and increasing engagement touch points throughout the trip planning and trip taking experience. User adoption of our mobile products and smartphone and tablet remains strong with more than 128 million cumulative TripAdvisor app downloads and nearly 50% of our traffic visiting via mobile devices during Q2.","On the phone we\u2019ve also made it possible for users to download cities directly from the TripAdvisor native app for off-line use, allowing travelers to access user reviews, photos and maps without incurring roaming charges. We have over 300 cities live today with the most popular destinations being Barcelona, Paris and London. In the future we\u2019re planning to make this feature available for every country, province, state and city in the world.","We\u2019re also making good progress in personalizing the TripAdvisor research experience for users. We recently introduced a new tab-based user interface to 100% of traffic in all major markets, we\u2019ve already seen higher levels of engagement. For now we will focus primarily on personalizing the hotel shopping experience due to our growing percentage of non-hotel traffic. We also have a unique opportunity in the future to enhance the in-destination research experiences for restaurants and attractions.","Switching to our Vacation Rentals business, we continue to focus on improving supply quality and increasing demand which leads to better conversion. Offering owners the free-to-list option is transform our business and allowed us to focus on improving the quality of the overall vacation rental booking experience. The new model continues to drive strong inventory growth, as we now have nearly 640,000 properties, up nearly 40% from last year, providing consumers with greater choice. At the same time, we have actually been actively removing lower quality inventory in order to help the traveler find the best rentals.","As for improving demand, we are investing in resource just to amplify our search engine presence, as well as improving our CRM touch points. As we are improving consumers booking experience in hotels and vacation rentals on the accommodation side, we are doing the same in restaurants.","Integration of our lafourchette acquisition has gone very smoothly. In addition to amplifying lafourchette\u2019s business momentum with the TripAdvisor brands and Internet marketing expertise, the team has focused on integrating restaurant reservations deeper into the TripAdvisor experience. TripAdvisor users that are looking to make a dining reservation in France or Spain, we are able to search by date and availability. You can also see special offers on desktop and mobile web with special offers coming soon to mobile apps. As a result we are seeing a significant increase in restaurant bookings via TripAdvisor.","As we continue to optimize conversion, the team is working \u2013 the team is increasingly working on widening the top of the funnel leveraging TripAdvisor\u2019s core online marketing expertise and making incremental investments to stand internationally.","With over 2.3 million restaurant listings and over 200 plus million monthly restaurant page views, TripAdvisor\u2019s scale and breadth of content is unmatched in the restaurant space and adding restaurant reservations makes the perfect fit or our core use of proposition.","Overall, we delivered strong results across business units and I want to thank all TripAdvisor employees for their continued hard work and dedication. We are proud of the progress we have made and we are looking forward to an exciting rest of the year.","I will now turn the call over to Julie.","Julie M.B. Bradley","Thank you, Steve. We\u2019re excited by the strong acceleration in our core business. And by the great progress we are making to help lot more consumers with more businesses on our platform. Second quarter total revenue growth accelerated to 31%, up from 22% growth in Q1, coming in at $323 billion. As that provided a 2% tail wind.","On the bottom line, adjusted EBITDA growth accelerated to 14%, up from 12% in Q1. Click-based revenue growth accelerated to 28%, up from 16% in Q1. This Q2 performance was driven by stronger CPC pricing for our metasearch leads and an easing year-over-year cost treated by last year\u2019s metasearch transition.","Revenue per hotel shopper accelerated to the third straight quarter, reaching 11% compared to positive 1% in Q1 and negative 13% in the year-ago quarter. CPC prices were consistent with what we saw in Q1, speaking to the ongoing competition for a high-value lead.","As a reminder, Instant Booking revenue is included in the Click-based revenue line. While Instant Booking revenue was relatively de minimis to our Q2 results. We expected to grow as we onboard more partners and expand global coverage of this feature.","I will remind everyone that as we move throughout the back half of the year and into next year, our hotel shopper growth comps eased. Additionally, Q3 will be the first full quarter that we have a clean comp from the metasearch transition. As such, we expect strong revenue acceleration again in Q3. And believe, there is a potential for further upside to our revenue-per-hotel shopper metric, between now and October.","Display-based revenue growth was solid as 19%. We\u2019re seeing rising aggregate spend in destination marketing organization sector worldwide. And we\u2019re seeing a trend emerge in hotelier\u2019s shifting their marketing strategies from campaign investment to an always on spend strategy. With nearly 280 million monthly visitors across 43 localized point of sale, TripAdvisor is well positioned as an increasingly attractive channel for these travel industry marketers.","Subscription, transaction and other revenue also showed solid growth at 55%, especially in light of a 21 point proper compare. This was driven in part due to contribution from our lafourchette and vacation home rentals acquisition, to roughly one half of the quarter. We are pleased with the smooth integration of all of these acquired businesses and are actively looking for more great products and teams to add to the TripAdvisor family.","On the expense side, as planned, total expenses de-levered three points sequentially, driven primarily by our selling and marketing line, which is directly related to the timing of our TV ad campaign. We aggressively launched our new TV ad campaign in May, investing approximately $10 million during the quarter and expect to continue to run our new ads in the U.S., France and Australia through October. Given this strong early indicator we may look to modestly expand the campaign into another market or two and are forecasting total TV advertising investment inline with 2013 levels of approximately $30 million. However, as compared to 2013 most of the investments will be concentrated in Q3 as opposed to Q4 of last year.","Moving on to taxes. Our Q2 GAAP effective tax rate of 31% increased sequentially primarily due to certain discrete items as well as some changes in full year forecasted geographical mix. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate for the full year to be inline with our 2013 rate of approximately 28%.","We had 146 million diluted shares outstanding during Q2 and we estimate that our diluted share count will increase roughly 1% to 2% by the end of 2014 subject to stock prices movement, potential share buyback and new share issuances.","Q2 CapEx was $22 million or 7% of revenue driven by capitalized engineering salaries and leasehold improvements to support global office expansion. We continue to expect 2014 CapEx to be inline with 2013 exit rate of approximately 8% of revenue.","From a liquidity standpoint our cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities decreased by $24 million during the quarter to $721 million, driven primarily by positive free cash flow of $136 million offset by an aggregate $152 million, we use to complete our three acquisitions during the quarter.","We have just over $100 million remaining under our existing share repurchase plan outstanding borrowings of $320 million as well as an undrawn credit facility of $200 million.","As it relates to guidance, we are reiterating full-year total revenue growth in the high 20s to low 30s. This includes click-based revenue growth in the high 20s, display-based revenue growth in the mid to high teens and subscription transaction and other revenue growth in the high 60s.","On the expense side, we are making incremental investments for our core hotel business as well as our newly acquired restaurant business. We expect these investments to accelerate building TripAdvisor\u2019s brand driving traffic growth and expanding our restaurant business in new countries.","Rolling it up we expect adjusted EBITDA growth in the high 20s consistent with the low end of our previous guidance range. Often those that these expectations are based upon months and dates data, historical patterns, estimates and other factors while we tend to be appropriately conservative this represents our best spots as of today. As a reminder, our click-based revenue is highly sensitive to fluctuations in hotel shopper growth conversion as well as partner CPC pricing, which are risks.","Conversely our forecast does not contemplate any meaningful risk in CPC prices or additional on-site conversion improvements from where we are today, nor does it perpetually contemplate any meaningful additional revenue from our Instant Booking initiative or any additional positive impacts from our TV ad campaign. So those represent potential upside from a traffic and revenue standpoint.","In summary, our core business is strengthening and we\u2019re very excited about our additional monetization opportunities in front of us.","We will now open the call up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.","Lloyd Walmsley \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Wondering if you can just talk about how the click-based ad revenue was growing towards the end of the quarter. I think you said over 30% April, continue to be strong in May and then Julie, in the script you commented that revenues per hotel shopper could strengthen further over the course of the year. The total quarter was a little bit below April. So wondering if you can just comment on how growth actually the quarter, how it looks now? And then as a follow-up, if you can just elaborate on the sharp acceleration in EMEA, what\u2019s driving that versus the U.S. growth more or less in line with last quarter?","Julie M.B. Bradley","","Sure. This is Julie, I\u2019ll start-off with your first question. So last quarter we did note that April was off to a strong start for click-based revenue growth of 30%. And what I was referring to in that comment was our core TripAdvisor business whereas for the full quarter consistent with April was 30% growth. What you see in our aggregate results includes our [A&G] (ph) family and they were slightly below that 30%. So in the aggregate it rose to 28%.","I appreciate your question on asking for the exit rate on Q2. But I think you\u2019ll find that that was probably a one-time comment for us in Q1 and we\u2019re not in the habit of providing inter-quarter guidance?","Lloyd Walmsley \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","","Okay.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dean Prissman from Credit Suisse. Your question please.","","Dean J. Prissman \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","I\u2019ll ask two questions, Steve. First, anecdotally the adoption rate of TripConnect appears to be picked up nicely. Is there anything you can share on the impact you\u2019re seeing on pricing on pages where there is a TripConnect participant? And then I have a follow-up.","Stephen Kaufer","","Sure. This is Steve. So, yes, there are more and more independent hoteliers getting further traffic with the TripConnect CPC-based bidding. You\u2019ll see TripConnect continues to go through an evolution of not only having CPC partners becoming later this year having CPA or specific booking partners. ","While it\u2019s clearly growing, it\u2019s hard for us to measure the impact in the CPC auction. I can tell you in general the folks that are savvy enough to want to be able buy clicks on TripAdvisor are savvy enough to want pay market rates to get them. So you\u2019ll likely see them in premier positions, not necessarily the top, but premier positions. So we\u2019re getting a pretty good CPC from those folks.","We think in general there is a level of expertise that the hotelier has to have or the marketing partner has to have in order to buy traffic on that CPC basis. They have to be able to measure or believe in the return on investment from the clicks, how many bookings that\u2019s driving. And so moving forward with TripConnect and sort of the next generation of the TripConnect connectivity for Instant Booking we\u2019ll be able to go to many of these same hoteliers and a whole lot more to say, sign up on TripConnect and it\u2019s a commission basis like you\u2019re are used to paying for the bookings that we provide in our Instant Booking flow.","And we\u2019re hopeful that that adoption will be much easier because it\u2019s truly only a pay-for-booking when I get it. Don\u2019t pay for anything when it doesn\u2019t materialize. And you had a second part of the question.","Dean J. Prissman \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","So commentary from many other players within the online travel ecosystem suggests that same day reservations are a meaningful driver of smartphone bookings. Based on the metasearch queries, you observed to what end is this consistent with user behavior on TripAdvisor and how meaningful of an opportunity is, say, are same day bookings for you?","Stephen Kaufer","I would say, yes, we absolutely see the booking window skew much more closer in on the phone with Instant Booking order, metasearch on the phone. I \u2013 but overall, it\u2019s not a particularly meaningful part of our total mix. You can appreciate or these our thesis behind it is TripAdvisor is wonderful, awesome for planning that a trip it might be the full weekend get away, it might be the full two week in Paris or the Caribbean or anywhere you like to go. The benefit reading the reviews, selecting the photos, looking at the Popularity Index, personalizing the experience, we believe directly correlates to hey, how long am I going to be on vacation.","The same day booking is much more about location only, is the hotel near where I need to be near the airport, near my business meeting and as such there as many other sites that also serve that functionality. And TripAdvisor, we believe obviously has a better set of recommendations, but we don\u2019t expect to earn in outsized portion of those last day bookings as our competitors.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your question please.","Douglas T. Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","","Great, thanks for taking my question. One for Julie, if you could just talk one on 3Q, and just following up on Lloyd\u2019s question. Just curious what gives you sort of a confidence and around the drivers of potential upside here in revenue-per-hotel shopper over the next couple of months in 3Q. And then, Steve, perhaps on Instant Booking, give us some color on how the discussions with major hotel chains are going currently, thanks.","Julie M. B. Bradley","Hi, Doug. And so, the confidence around 3Q is directly related to the fact that this is the first full kind of clean comp and for our metasearch on transition, but so we are seeing great results from the transition. And in Q3 of last year, and that was our most negative impact, as there was a full rollout. And that was really the trough of the transition. So, where we are setting yourself up with an easy comp.","Stephen Kaufer","","And this is Steve with the hotel chain discussions. I\u2019d say there is strong interest on the part of every caveat almost every hotel chain that we spoken to there is a bit of a the recent \u2013 we feel a stronger sense of urgency than many of the big hotel chains simply because we love to get them all signed up enrolling before desktop launches than where we have the better the offering, whereas so current mobile offering isn\u2019t perhaps driving enough bookings to make them come over to the new platforms soon enough. ","So when I look forward I generally think it\u2019s absolutely aligned with hoteliers interest. That\u2019s why they participate in the metasearch and we believe that\u2019s why many if not all, will be participating in the Instant Booking platform. It\u2019s a question of sometime on their part, because it is new development work and a question of resources to get it up off the ground, tested live, and since we do drive a fair number of queries and a fair number of bookings it has to be a petty scalable solution on their end.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nat Schindler from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.","Nathaniel Schindler \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, hi. Thank you. Two questions for Julie. One, can you explain to us the accounting changes or the balance sheet changes that are going on, that are causing a real acceleration in the free cash flow growth. I know it\u2019s in the deferred merchant payables numbers up a lot, as well as changes in receivables. Secondly, and I was wondering if some of that might relate to Instant Booking and how it\u2019s accounted for and if you can go into a little bit on how the accounting for that would work and where the revenue would come in.","Secondly, on the second question, you mentioned that your guidance does not include any new information from the advertising campaign or the rest of the advertising campaign is thus upside to the potential guidance. The same language last quarter, but the difference is you probably spent half of your $30 million to date. Are you including what has occurred in your learnings from the $15 million or so that has probably been spent in the first several months of your ad campaign into your guidance, or is it still that is anything from the brand campaign is upside? Thank you.","Julie M.B. Bradley","So I will take your first question on the balance sheet. The deferred merchant payable is definitely a large driver of the increase in cash flow also seasonality in the quarter. For the deferred merchant payable and I think about that as like a deposit. So these are transaction businesses where we collect the money from the travelers in advance and when they stay we pass it on to either the hotel or the property owners if it happens to be a vacation rental. So as those businesses continue to grow you should see the benefit that we will derive from the cash flow.","On the TV ad campaign, I just want to correct a couple of numbers. So our total spend is estimated around $30 million for the year. We spend $10 million in the second quarter as we had started going on air and in May and so, we definitely clearly has seen a uptick in some traffic from the geographies that we were in. And our plan is to continue to aggressively funds in the third quarter.","Stephen Kaufer","And two point we, this is Steve. We\u2019ve continued to spend in July. So, you can essentially think of it as the consistent run rate from now or from May through October. And we tend to where we always forecast going forward based upon the run rates we\u2019ve seen, so the degree to which our current run rate has been influenced by TV that part is already baked into our expectations or guidance going forward. To the degree that a more long lasting campaign running for several more months builds on that as opposed to stays level and that would be upside to our numbers.","And we have seen the campaign build over time, but we are cautious on predicting anything that we haven\u2019t seen. So we are not projecting at this point. We are not forecasting a build greater than what we\u2019ve seen so far.","Nathaniel Schindler \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Great, thank you.","","Julie M.B. Bradley","","And nearly thinking about to one of the questions that Lloyd had asked early on and I missed in answering and that was with regard to EMEA growth versus U.S. growth. And so I take couple of factors and that the international revenue continue to grow with the percentage of total revenue for about 53% this past quarter and we did benefit from 2% tailwind on overall revenue. And then, the second more operational wins relates into to our last year our meta roll out schedule. And so, as we finish our transition in last act that we should do start to see and some of the top trends.","","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahene from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.","Mark Mahaney \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hey Julie, could you please just clarify the kind of the trimming down of the EBITDA growth guidance and probably just a little bit more detail different sound like you change mid total amount of commitment to TV that campaign, so what else is in there, you misses that you kind of be opportunistic with new investments growth, investments or some of the investments coming a little more expensive when you would first term, thank you.","Julie M. B. Bradley","Hi sure, thank for the question. And to ask that we just look at our overall opportunity and to continue to and amplify that the TripAdvisor brand and to also expand internationally with our newly acquired restaurant business. And we have put together a set of specific investments that we plan to roll out over the next as a second half of the year that aimed to increase international expansion, getting lafourchette into new countries and really take advantage of all of the TripAdvisor restaurants page views, and that we have on our site.","Mark Mahaney \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thanks gentlemen.","Julie M.B. Bradley","","You\u2019re Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Ou next question comes from the line of Mike Olsen from Piper Jaffray. Your question please.","Michael Olson \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co.","","Hey, good afternoon. Just two questions, here you talked earlier about hotel groups being interested in books. Is it fair to say that you are expecting Instant Book will be skewed more towards hotel groups initially, but ultimately if more hotel groups get on board that can push OTAs to get more involved to avoid the trend of booking recently going direct from TripAdvisor to the hotel website.","And secondly, both price manger itself got more address that outside of the core channel market with vacation rentals restaurants, talk a lot about that on the call. What other categories do you look at further monetize your existing kind of review content and visitors for example events and attractions bookings or other categories. Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer","","This is Steve. So the changes in the OTAs and I kind of put the independence as third category. We are absolutely pursuing all three categories simultaneously and we think very aggressively and the conversations are on going with most and all of the major OTAs, with most not all of the chain groups and we haven\u2019t started the conversations directly with the independent hoteliers since we have to get the connectivity working through the Internet booking engines.","So, kind of we have all free in the works, my sincere hope is that all three eventually or three categories eventually come into the store, I don\u2019t really think there is much of a \u2013 I don\u2019t have any doubt that the independent hoteliers will pop onboard just a matter of time in terms of reaching for them all, because it\u2019s another booking channel for them. ","So many have expressed interest and it\u2019s a matter of contract negotiations and development works. So, that will common OTAs have expressed varying degrees of interest and we would hope and expect to have a robust marketplace. With all of our types of clients in the store.","Again make the point that Instant Booking is additive to the meta environment, so if we don\u2019t have a particular client or a set of clients participating in Instant Book that\u2019s okay. The consumer still sees adverse nothing different than what they see today and if we have Instant Booking covers, then they also have an Instant Book link. So it\u2019s still a net ad to the consumer. We believe any which way and over no matter what time period it takes to get all the various clients onboard.","To the second question on additional monetization, response pretty big move for us in that while we had page views and it always holds CPM and perhaps sponsorships against it. We think the opportunity in the restaurant space is phenomenal. We just can\u2019t see any, it\u2019s hard for us to see a path whereby huge numbers of travelers, huge number of locals won\u2019t be making their, for not seen the path where we once can be making their restaurant reservations on their smartphone and increasing numbers globally. And so we found a fantastic partner, a fantastic team in lafourchette, pulled them into the family and are targeting them with expanding.","For us that\u2019s a fantastic use of the capital that we built up in our core business, because we know they are current model works, we have other players in the space that have a model that works and has been very profitable in scales. And so when we look and say what an excellent use were growth capital for us. And yes, it comes at the expense of some of our EBITDA today, but it is tough, it\u2019s not even in the bad category, it\u2019s in the clear investment we see a perfect opportunity and we\u2019re going to leverage it, because we\u2019ve always said we\u2019re building the business for the long term and we see a great opportunity.","Yes, we see other opportunities to help travelers, because we have travelers coming to TripAdvisor doing things other than just hotels and restaurants and certainly attractions of tours, or guides, or other travel related things are on the side. But there\u2019s only so much folks can do it at one time and we have some great partners in that space, and our focus at the moment is restaurants and how we can monetize, in general, are non-hotel traffic. So it\u2019s a great question and we get starting in hotels, and then flights, and then vacation rentals, and then restaurants, and it\u2019s safe to say, that we will be going beyond where we are now. But that\u2019s all we can say for now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Diclemente from Nomura. Your question please.","Ron Zember \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi, there. This is Ron Zember on for Anthony. Just a quick question about Instant Booking. There\u2019s been a pretty impressive rollout this past quarter going from 10% coverage to 100% coverage of devices and I wanted to talk a little bit about rollout into desktop and tablet. I was wondering if decrements that you have with your partners are device-specific or if we can assume that if there is a partner that dwell on the smartphone it eventually will also be available on desktop tablets?","Stephen Kaufer","","Hi, Ron. To answer your question, we couldn\u2019t comment on sort of contract specific items, but it\u2019s a little hard to think of who the client would be that would only want a direct booking or reservation on the phone and not on all of our platforms. So I can\u2019t say it\u2019d never happen, but it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re hearing from our clients as an option that they would even want. They want the most bookings that they can get and by definition it\u2019s a profitable booking that they\u2019re only paying when it\u2019s booking. So we don\u2019t envision that to be a challenge or frankly even much of a question with our clients.","Ron Zember \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Got you. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom White from Macquarie. Your question please.","Thomas White \u2013 Macquarie Research","Great. Thanks for taking my question. It\u2019s on Instant Book for mobile. I know it\u2019s relatively early since the rollup, but maybe I was hoping you could talk a little bit about any signs that that monetization kind of smartphone versus desktop that you guys have talked about in the past, any sense that it\u2019s closing and maybe giving us an update on kind of what that percentage is today. And then also just in terms of how consumers are actually using your smartphone app now that Instant Book is there. Any sense of kind of how many \u2013 what percentage of consumers are actually clicking on the Instant Book button when it\u2019s available alongside kind of the other traditional metasearch links? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer","","Sure. It\u2019s still little early for us to talk about the numbers and the percentages about the Instant Book piece. I give you the caveat that when we look at a rollout we look at the global rollout, all languages. And so on the phone it\u2019s still just U.S. travelers going globally, but still just a subset of even our overall phone traffic. It\u2019s also probably little early to tell how much of an impact it\u2019s having on repeat traffic, we do measure as the repeat booking behavior, and we certainly do see that folks who are abandoning or shopping cart if you will, they start down the instant book flow. We do see a good percentage of them coming back to finish the transaction, which is certainly what we would hope.","It\u2019s hard for us to analyze how many of those folks would have come back to us any ways and clicked on the meta-click, so there is still a lot of ifs and ands, and then until we have more of a full roll out, more full coverage, and until we have the data from the desktop, it can be hard to compare what the net effect is.","Thomas White \u2013 Macquarie Research","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Naved Kahn from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question please.","Naved Kahn \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","","Yes, thanks for taking the question. Just on the EBITDA guidance sort of being treated towards the low end, and I think Julie, can you explain about the investments going into the building out the lafourchette sort of opportunity across different geographies. Should we think about there is an investment on this particular sort of initiative and the relative investment that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to be a long-term in nature. Or is it something that you think you can get mostly done in 2014, and then 2015 and beyond, sort of more of a monetization cycle?","Stephen Kaufer","","So, we do look at the restaurant business in terms of our core markets where we are the leaders and the expansion markets the newer international markets where you might have a small footprint and need to grow it. Put lender some things or a country where we have no presence in whatsoever. And there isn\u2019t already an established leader or maybe there are some players that we need to continue with.","We are confidence that the core markets continue to grow at a good pace and that\u2019s generally we consider a profitable growth, so we expect continue to reinvest those profits into our newer markets, then depending on the speed at which we want to enter new markets that\u2019s going to take us negative in the restaurant business because it is such a good opportunity.","Unknown that we can\u2019t forecast, we haven\u2019t done our 2015 yet is how much can the overall TripAdvisor brand and traffic bring in those new markets to know how quickly those new markets can turn it profitable for the restaurant.","To my earlier point, we have no hesitation in stating that it\u2019s the great segment to be in. we feel we deserve to play because the traffic and the content and the brand we have, at least in the markets that we\u2019re choosing to compete in. And so it\u2019s a question of feet on the ground, signing up restaurants, getting the inventory, putting the widgets on our site, on the restaurant site and that\u2019s something that the great team at La Fourchette know how to do very well. And so, part of the acquisition was being able to provide the growth capital.","I wouldn\u2019t want to leave you with impression that it is just a 2014 investment, because we haven\u2019t made a decision yet for 2015. But when I talk about investing for a longer term horizon, which I talk about frequently that would lead one to think, hey, I\u2019m thinking about building the restaurant business to be very meaningful for TripAdvisor over a three to five plus year timeframe and that\u2019s going to take more than a quarter or two of investment dollars.","Naved Kahn \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","","That\u2019s helpful. And then, I have a quick follow-up. Can you break out the contribution from La Fourchette, the net acquisitions in the second quarter? And what you might be modeling on for the full fiscal 2014 forecast?","Julie M. B. Bradley","","No, we are not breaking out the contributions from the acquired companies in the second quarter.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Heath P. Terry \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Great, thanks. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense of the difference in hotel shopper profitability in Instant Book when using our hotel partner like Choice versus going through Tingo or Getaroom? And how much of the improvement in profitability that you\u2019re expecting over time is going to come from signing up additional hotel partners versus just the natural profitability of the channel?","Stephen Kaufer","So I couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t make a public comment about which client has higher conversions or who is better. You can appreciate how we are trying in the Instant Book path to show the partner that we think will do the best in terms of driving overall dollar volume commission value to TripAdvisor. So one might argue that suppliers have a leg up in many markets simply by using a name like Choice that gives comfort to the consumer, a well known brand in Expedia or booking or in Orbitz would deliver comfort that the booking is a safe one.","So that\u2019s going to help drive the conversion from when I press Instant Book to when I complete the transaction. You take that conversion rate. You factor in the commission rates that TripAdvisor has paid. You factor in the overall rates of the room and the availability to help figure out and it\u2019s part of conversion, but it will sort of work its way back to an effective CPC that that Instant Booking button is taking and we compare that effective CPC with what our meta auction shows and we say, hey, is this a more effective place for the traveler to go.","We have to look at it over time because when someone goes down the Instant Book path, we believe they\u2019ll often come back to finish the booking even if they don\u2019t finish it the first time around. But that\u2019s the kind of level of sophistication that we\u2019re starting to develop, be able to evaluate which is the better channel, which is the best provider to power that Instant Booking option.","When you look at the site today, you can kind of take a look at, hey, based upon what we know now, whose winning the ability to power the Instant Book button and you can see Choice, for example, is frequently winning that opportunity. And so somewhere in that whole equation we\u2019ve decided that that\u2019s best for consumers and our bottom line.","Heath P. Terry \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks, Steve.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman from Cowen and Company. Your question please.","Kevin Kopelman \u2013 Cowen and Company","Hi, thanks. Can you give us an update on the Vacation Rentals business, what you saw in the quarter, how growth looked versus last quarter? And also, what percentage of that business has transitioned over into the commission-based model? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer","","Sure. So Vacation Rentals certainly has grown. We don\u2019t break it out separately from the subscription and other line, but absolutely both of them biggest components of that line. Vacation Rentals and Business Listings continue to post very strong above the average growth rates or above the TripAdvisor overall growth rate. And, yes, more and more business is moving over to the commission-based model as opposed to subscription.","Sorry I don\u2019t have the exact percentage in front of me. I\u2019m not sure I will be able to talk about it anyways, but I know that that trend continues. And, again, while we\u2019re not discontinuing the subscription line we\u2019re certainly putting most of our attention on driving the commission-based payment model going forward.","So there shouldn\u2019t be any surprise that will continue to grow in overall percentage of Vacation Rentals. That was correct.","Kevin Kopelman \u2013 Cowen and Company","Okay thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Susquehanna. Your question please.","Michael Costantini \u2013 Susquehanna International Group, LLP","Hi, this is Michael Costantini on for Brian. I just had a few questions on the Click-based revenue growth. Just wondering roughly what percentage of hotel shoppers are clicking on monetize meta links? And that\u2019s to your first question potential upside as more shoppers get used to products by clicking? And if so what type of assumption are you making in the guidance around monetize per click for hotel shopper? And then just on the Click-based revenue guidance for 2014, last quarter you said, a high 20s, the low 30s this quarter you just said high 20s, I just want to confirm that was the case just high 20s now? Thanks.","Julie M.B. Bradley","Sure I\u2019ll take the second one first. I said we are reiterating our Click-based revenue guidance at high 20s to low 30s.","Michael Costantini \u2013 Susquehanna International Group, LLP","All right thanks.","Stephen Kaufer","Hi so this is Steve. On the topic of the meta-search we continue to expect growth in the overall meta channel even as we add Instant Booking, because our overall hotel shoppers continue to grow. And we don\u2019t see anything wrong conceptually with the visitor that clicks on a couple of meta bookings, clicks into Instant Book i.e. nothing go down one path versus the other, you\u2019re welcome to choose both.","In fact we view the price comparison aspect as we\u2019ve seen all the meta prices and letting user go and check that they are real to be perfectly valid user experience all the way to the point where, hey for meta or for Instant Book partner has a room for $200 \u2013 has a hotel for $208 and a meta partner has it room for \u2013 hotel for $175. Great as smart consumer may well click on that meta link and book with one of our clients, the rate is cheaper, amen to that, we still made money on the meta auction even though we are Instant Book wasn\u2019t the eventual booking source.","We\u2019re perfectly good with that. We expect it to happen a time going forward. Instant Booking is not a replacement for meta. So yes, we expect to see meta auction we\u2019re paying very close attention to the meta auction even as we roll out Instant Book.","Julie M.B. Bradley","Yes, and I just want to correct what I said, we did reiterate on our overall guidance. Total revenue guidance in high-20s to low-30s and our Click-based revenue guidance in the high-20s and that\u2019s exactly what we said in the previous quarter.","Michael Costantini \u2013 Susquehanna International Group, LLP","","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald from Jefferies. Your question please.","Stephen Kaufer","Hello.","Julie M.B. Bradley","Hello.","Stephen Kaufer","Yes.","Brian Patrick Fitzgerald \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Sorry I got crossed there. Just really quickly you\u2019ve been investing in personalization. Wanted to know if you could give us any color in terms of the positive impacts there you\u2019re seeing either in terms of higher user engagement or conversions? And then, really quickly any discernible impacts or changes from [Panda] (ph) updates. Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer","","Sure. So on personalization, we have sort of two flavors of it. The first is we\u2019ve learned a lot about what makes a hotel right for one person versus the other. I refer to those as tags and we\u2019ve rolled out in all of our major cities is kind of tag based interface, I should say on desktop tablet interfaces, not yet on phone. That\u2019s allowing folks to say I am looking for a boutique four star with free breakfast and get the right list. That\u2019s truly just perfect for them. So they\u2019ve actively selected those.","Still on just a subsection of our overall traffic we have that experience plus the personalized experience that\u2019s based upon your browsing history and a bit of what we might know about you from the things you\u2019ve contributed on the site. So for members that have been back or visitors that have this previously for members that have been back all of a sudden we will in fact make a better recommendation for you than the vanilla user for whom we don\u2019t know anything.","In both of those cases last I checked that converged, in both those cases the engagement was up clearly, more time on site, more page views. In both those cases the conversion seem to be up a bit, but it wasn\u2019t something that was \u2013 moved the needle enough for me to be sort of talking or bragging about. It\u2019s still early days. We haven\u2019t rolled out the personalization based upon the browser history for a full audience yet.","We still have some tweaks that we think we can make that will in fact lock in some of those conversion improvement as well as just offer a better recommendation more off. The needle will never be perfect, but given the one-time it fits-all that so many travel sites offer, we think this is a real game changer in terms of long-term stickiness for folks coming back to TripAdvisor because TripAdvisor knows you. We\u2019ve learned about you and watched your history. It\u2019s a work in progress.

This resulted in full year total revenue growth of 24% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 7%.","We are very pleased with our financial results but are even more excited by our continued strong traffic and content growth given our global scale as well as successfully transitioning the core business to meta, a transformational part of improvement we made to dramatically enhance the hotel shopping experience on TripAdvisor.","Top of the funnel metrics remains strong as total traffic to TripAdvisor sites grew 50% during the quarter and 55% for the year with more than 2 billion unique annual visitors in 2013 according to Google Analytics, a testament to our global brand building efforts and powerful network effects. Hotel shoppers grew 25% in the quarter and 36% for the year with notable strength in our core U.S. and UK markets. Internationally, we rolled out four new points of sale in 2013 and we're pending to roll out eight more in 2014, delivering a more localized experience to international users.","Our members are more engaged than ever contributing nearly 50 million reviews and opinions in 2013, increasingly coming from international users in foreign languages and via mobile devices. We recently launched new member profile pages on our website more prominently showcasing members' contributions in iconic bubble rating, a theme that also shines through in our full site brand refresh and our TV ads.","This year, we are integrating photos from our recent Oyster acquisition into TripAdvisor. We're working on a more engaging member experience on mobile, and we have plans to make TripAdvisor membership further come to life for users. I wouldn't be surprised if a lucky member or two makes a cameo in one of our new TV spots which are due out this spring in advance of a busy summer travel planning season.","Strong traffic, content growth, and member engagement are at the core of our unique understanding of travelers. In 2014, we plan to leverage this knowledge further to develop a more customized and personalized experience for every user on this site. We started data testing our Just For You personalization initiative in Q4 and believe we are just scratching the surface in terms of providing a more targeted travel planning experience as we seek to delight our users with a personal guide when they are on their trip.","While the TripAdvisor travel community did its part in making the product better in 2013, our product and engineering teams have done the same in spades. I'll highlight three of these product initiatives; meta, mobile, and TripConnect, which illustrate how we're expanding TripAdvisor's reach within the travel planning funnel and enhancing TripAdvisor's value to users and partners alike.","The first, meta, which has been the most transformative usability improvement in our company's history. While the estimated financial impact proves to be choppier than we had originally expected, the bidding landscape matured during the fourth quarter driving nice sequential upticks in CPC pricing, and correspondingly revenue per hotel shopper. I'm pleased to report that the bidding landscape remains healthy year-to-date and that consumers love the new hotel shopping experience.","Secondly, on mobile, tablet and phone traffic as a percent of total traffic nearly doubled in 2013 to 40%, and app downloads grew nearly 150% to 82 million. On tablet, we made further improvements to the new native app and we are in the midst of rolling out more immersive user experience on tablet web. On phone, in 2013 we delivered a more engaging user experience by adding hotel pricing availability and integrating friend content on both mobile website and the native app. As previewed on our last call, we are working on an assisted booking path to optimize the smartphone hotel shopping funnel and to deliver hotel shoppers a simpler, more elegant hotel booking experience on TripAdvisor.","We are working with our OTA and hotelier partners and believe that the assisted booking path could result in more bookings and improved downstream conversion for partners. In turn, we believe this will benefit smartphone monetization and nice potential win-win-win for users, partners, and TripAdvisor.","Meta was the key product focus in 2013, and assisted book on mobile is our key product focus in 2014, and TripConnect is the product enhancement aimed at 2015 and beyond. That platform which launched last quarter to connect independent hotels to the TripAdvisor CPC option remains in the early stage of the adoption curve. While still very early, we believe TripConnect will allow us to build a deeper relationship with a broader set of partners as we match more hotel shoppers with independent hotels on TripAdvisor.","The theme of reducing friction for users and partners in order to enhance our long-term opportunities isn't just limited to our core CPC business. In display, sold impressions were up 34% during the year due to a larger, more productive global sales force, coupled with our Delayed Ad Call product innovation which has gotten a great traction with the growing list of hotel chains, airlines, financial brands, and travel brands.","In business listings, we ended the year with 69,000 subscriptions, up 38% due to better client facing tools such as an improved property dashboard, sales force productivity gains, and new value-based pricing model that more closely ties the hotel subscription fee to the bookings we generate through our platform. In vacation rentals, shifting the business through transaction-based model in early 2013 better aligned user, owner, and TripAdvisor interest. We've seen positive results in terms of accelerated inventory acquisition, more traveler inquiries, more bookings, and greater revenue growth.","Including our recently integrated new inventory, we now offer travelers approximately 550,000 listings to choose from, up more than 80% year-over-year. Increased choice for travelers has generated more inquiries than bookings on the site, which in turn has allowed us to drive more product improvements and better owner engagement. In 2014, we plan to further optimize the free-to-list platform by adding more high quality listings allowing us to drive additional improvements to the research and transaction funnel.","In China, Daodao and Kuxun remain among China's leading online travel brands. China has recently become the country with the most outbound travel expenditures, and we are focused on winning that traveler. During the year, we broadened our suite of travel products tailor-made for Chinese travelers and have seen strong demand for international content from our repeat users. We saw accelerated annual growth in 2013, and we remain squarely in investment mode in this market in light of the huge long-term opportunity that it represents.","Before I conclude, I just want to again highlight our philosophy on traffic growth. While we may already be the most popular travel site in terms of monthly unique users, we believe there remains a huge opportunity to introduce our brand and community to the billions of travelers who are not TripAdvisor users. And just as important, we want to stay top of mind with those travelers who have tried our services once or twice, but do not rely upon our site for every trip they take. To capture this audience, we will grow current channels, try new ad platforms, optimize traditional brand building strategies, and invest additional dollars in areas that we believe are yielding results.","As it relates to our efforts in search engine marketing, social, and TV, to name three big ones for us over the past few years, we are willing to invest up to 0 incremental profit margin in order to expand our reach and increase what we call trial of our site. In the case where we cannot measure a decent return on our investment, we'll work on improving, optimizing, and changing whatever it takes to figure out a successful path forward. Due to our long-term growth wins, we will always reinvest profit whenever we can officially grow our community and our top line.","Similarly, I'll remind everyone that we do not manage the business to a specific margin target. Therefore, should an investment opportunity emerge during 2014 to enhance our long-term growth prospects, we will likely take that option even if it comes with a short-term impact to our bottom line. As we've always said, we are in it for the long term."," ","In summary, 2013 was a great year but we are even more excited about how we position the business for strong long-term growth. Finally, I want to thank all TripAdvisor employees around the globe. It's your hard work that delivered these great results and this continued dedication will deliver an even better 2014.","I'll now turn the call over to Julie.","Julie M. B. Bradley","Thank you, Steve. Hello, everyone. Fourth quarter total revenue growth of 26% was broad based and well ahead of our internal expectations. Currency also provided a 1.5% tailwind to total revenue this quarter. On the bottom line, as expected, adjusted EBITDA growth slowed to negative 19% versus positive 17% in the year-ago quarter due to the high concentration of TV ad spend this past quarter.","Click-based revenue growth accelerated to 17% in the quarter, driven by hotel shopper growth of 25% and stronger pricing from our high value meta leads. This was offset by continued headwinds from smartphone and international traffic growth with smartphone impact intensifying on a relative basis, given continued strong hotel shopper growth on that device.","As for meta's impact, we're winning on all fronts. We've seen more bidders per property on average, more properties with at least one bidder and increasing CPCs as a function of greater competition in the option and that the meta option has had enough time in the marketplace that the value to partners can be realized. Add in some onsite conversion and we are pleased to say that we believe the meta transition achieved revenue neutrality in December.","While this is obviously a great way to end the year, it drives on two facts that I had mentioned on previous calls. First, our motto is highly sensitive to pricing. And second, CPCs can fluctuate widely in a short span of time. Nonetheless, we are pleased to see the positive trends continue thus far into 2014.","On the unit growth side, 25% retail shopper growth is a solid outcome up against strong growth rates in the year-ago quarter and 50% total traffic growth for Q4 signals' continued strength at the top end of the funnel. For full year 2013, 36% retail shopper growth drove 18% CPC revenue growth with a nice reacceleration in December and into 2014.","Display-based revenue growth finished on a very high note accelerating for the fourth straight quarter to 46% due to better sell-through rates in APAC and EMEA as well as compared to a seasonally weak Q4 2012. Full year 2013 display revenue grew 26% well above our 2013 expectations fueled by global sales coverage and productivity gains and bolstered by our Delayed Ad Call innovation.","Subscription, transaction and other revenue grew 53% for the quarter and 60% for the year, ahead of our full year expectation. The primary drivers were sales productivity and pricing improvements in business listings and increased brand awareness inventory and transactions in vacation rentals.","Specific to geographic mix, our core U.S. and UK markets showed notable strength in traffic and revenue growth. International revenue, revenue to sites other than dot-com increased slightly as a percentage of total growth based on hotel shopper growth globally and strong performance of our display and business listing products overseas. On the expense side in line with our expectations, Q4 expenses increased sequentially to 75% of revenue, driven primarily by the timing of our TV ad campaigns.","Moving on to taxes, our full year 2013 GAAP effective tax rate was 28% which was in line with our expectations and is a good proxy for our effective tax rate in 2014 dependent on international revenue and expense mix among other factors. We ended 2013 with 145.3 million diluted shares outstanding and we estimate that our diluted share count will increase roughly 1% to 2% by the end of 2014, subject to our stock price movement, potential share buyback and new share issuances.","CapEx for the quarter was $16 million or 8% of revenue. Full year CapEx was $55 million or 6% of revenue. Capitalized engineering salaries represented roughly half of our full year CapEx while the remainder was driven by data center expansion to support our traffic growth and leasehold improvements. We expect 2014 CapEx as a percent of revenue to remain in line with 2013's exit rate given the number of new and existing office expansions fully and to support our headcount growth.","From a liquidity standpoint, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable and long-term marketable securities increased $85 million during the year to $671 million, driven primarily by free cash flow of $294 million. We also allocated $145 million to repurchase common stock throughout the year and paid an aggregate of $35 million to acquire fixed company.","We entered 2014 with just over $100 million remaining on our existing share repurchase plan, outstanding borrowings of $340 million as well as an undrawn credit facility of $200 million.","With that, let me provide our thoughts for 2014. We exited 2013 with great momentum and are looking forward to build on that throughout 2014, which we believe will be another exciting year of growth and innovation. Based on the positive trends that emerge throughout Q4, we expect click-based revenue growth to accelerate throughout the year as we lap the meta transition in Q2, resulting in full year revenue growth in the low 20s.","As a reminder, our click-based revenue is highly sensitive to fluctuations in hotel shopper growth and increasingly from hotel shopper growth on the smartphone as well as partnered CPC pricing, all of which are risks. Conversely, this forecast does not contemplate any meaningful risk from our assisted booking initiative on mobile nor does it include any material traffic or repeat visitor risks from our TV ad campaigns. So those represent potential upside from the traffic and revenue standpoint.","We expect mid to high teens display-based revenue growth for the full year as our worldwide traffic growth gives us a unique position in the marketplace and our differentiated CPM products allow us to maintain premium pricing. Note that we are up against a very strong 2013 comp and this forecast does not include a repeat of 2013's Q4 growth rate.","We expect low 50s growth from our subscription, transaction and other business lines with subscriber growth pricing and sales efficiency gains driving business listings strength and continue mix shift to our fast growing free-to-list vacation rental product. These expectations imply that full year total revenue growth will be in the mid 20s.","On the expense side, we anticipate a similar level of investment as 2013 as we invest in talented people, global brand identification and traffic growth. Steve alluded to our traffic acquisition philosophy and I'd add that while we could operate the business to drive higher incremental margins, we believe that maintaining this level and other investments is appropriate given our strategic growth objective and the opportunities in front of us.","Rolling it up we expect strong full year 2014 EBITDA acceleration growing roughly in line with total revenue. Note that these expectations are based upon January data, historical patterns and other factors. While we attempt to be appropriately conservative, this represents our best thought as of today.","In summary, 2013 was a great year for the business. We entered 2014 with notable strengths in our core products and are leveraging our expanding position in the travel planning funnel to capture unique opportunities in new markets, new products and monetization.","We will now open the call up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank AG","Thanks, guys. I'm wondering if you can just help us understand the hotel shopper growth number in the quarter and kind of with your outlook. It looks like it decelerated a bit more than we would have expected particularly with the ramp in direct marketing spend and yet the click-based revenue line and the revenue guide was much stronger even if you kind of zero out the meta drag, so with a lot of the deceleration in markets that were not really monetized really well and thus have a lower impact on the click-based revenue, if you could help us understand that? And then on the booking path side, just wondering if you could give us an update on the timing of facilitated booking in smartphones?","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. Thanks, Lloyd. Certainly, two good questions. The hotel shopper growth \u2013 the first thing as we call that really was a tough comp in the prior year, and we will be facing a similar tough comp in the first half of 2014. So, we were really thrilled that we had seen such strong growth previously with this overall scale in which we're operating. So when we look at \u2013 at the current growth rates, we think they're more down to, hey, this is what reality looks like for a business of our size. The fact that we were able to continue to deliver some nice click-based revenue growth on that hotel shopper is not only the dissipation of those meta headwinds, but also the onsite conversion work that we had been doing, and the other kind of normal operating parts of the business. So we see that as trending nicely not only at the end of 2013, but also through January 2014. So on the booking path part of the question, we don't have a specific timeframe that we're ready to release yet. We're happy with the progress that we've made. We're a company that sort of prides ourselves on growing quickly. I'll make the note specifically because we've been talking about the meta headwinds and are overcoming those to just make sure folks understand that while meta was truly transformational for the company, a phenomenal win for our travelers, and after our choppy waters, a great win for us now as we look forward to being positive on the meta transition. It was difficult for us and our partners to do that full conversion from the old click style to the new meta model. We didn't give anyone really the choice to not participate. If you wanted to buy lease from TripAdvisor, you had to move over to the meta model. Assisted book is much more of an optimization of what we're able to do on the phone releasing the friction on all the rest of the reasons we've described, but to be clear we don't require anyone to do it. The product will still work just as well as it does today if assisted book is there or isn't there. Obviously, we expect it to be positive, but it's much less of a dramatic change for our partners and frankly much less for TripAdvisor ourselves. And so the timeframe for us to get assisted book to be successful and a positive driver for our travelers in 2014 is just a lot less urgency than what we were facing in 2013 with the meta transition.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank AG","Just as a follow-up, when you say the onsite conversion is better, is that just getting users who land on the metasearch pages to interact more with the monetizable clicks through to the OTAs?","Stephen Kaufer","Yes, and it is whether they are landing on the metasearch pages or frankly anywhere on the site, we made some nice progress in getting travelers to move down the funnel to both check more prices on properties as well as follow through and actually click through to our clients, and one of the things that we theorize on the backs of increased CPC from our clients is that the lead that we're sending folks as of now is better. They are more valuable that we might have been sending them six months ago based upon the work that the team has done on the site, so a more qualified visitor leaves TripAdvisor further down the buying cycle in their mind, and so when they land on a partner's site, they're more likely to finish the transaction. We also just have a lot more or many more clients who are active in the auction on many of our different forms of sale, so that extra competition I'm sure has played a part in the price increases that we've seen recently.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets","I'm sorry, can you hear me?","Stephen Kaufer","Yes.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets","Sorry about that. Can you just give any color on your hiring of the creative ad campaigns, your thoughts on how the TV ad brand campaigns have been going so far? And then there was a real quick reference in the press release to maybe one-time items or seasonal items in the display advertising number in the December quarter. Could you just put a little more color on what those were, what those may have been? Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. Thanks, Mark. The TV ad campaign, we were pleased to be able to see in all four markets results in terms of the main direct traffic and awareness surveys that we had conducted. So this was our first foray into TV at any magnitude, and we were pleased that what we had put together delivered to the market, delivered results on the site. As with anything we do, we look to iterate , expand, drive more efficiencies, and in the case of our campaign, we're looking for perhaps a harder hitting campaign, something that's going to be a bit more memorable than some of our commercials. I think what we delivered was an excellent beginning and now we look to the team and say, great, we've got our feet wet. We clearly \u2013 we can measure our success there, so now let's go in for some more. And if you recall when we first talked about TV, there was the, hey, we'll try it and if we can see signs that it's working, we'll continue. Well, great, we saw signs that it was working and now we're looking to continue and optimize. In terms of the fourth quarter display items, we were getting supplies on our own forecasting ability that a couple of larger orders dropped into the quarter that hadn't been part of our normal forecast. For whatever reason, Q4 tends to be tough for us to get an accurate read on. In Q4 2012 it was tough. In Q4 2011 it was good, so we've been seesawing a little bit. And so anyway we're pleased to have it. When we look at our 2014 forecast, we're not baking in another big quarter due to big items coming in, in the fourth though when we look at the whole year, we feel that display had a pretty good year. There's certainly the notion of kind of year-end budgets being flushed, for lack of a better word, on CPM and other display campaigns. We probably got a piece of that but in prior years that either hasn't happened or we missed a piece, so it's a big tough for us to forecast accurately.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies","Hi. Good afternoon. As far as the assisted book on the mobile initiative, how are hotel and OTA partners reacting to that? Do the partners have any I guess concern about not having those shoppers coming into their environment or do they not really care as long as they get the booking?","Stephen Kaufer","Good question. So it's tough to generalize all partners. If I were to characterize in general, the supplier community in general says, great, we're happy to take the booking. We're going to service the customer and the fact that it happens on \u2013 in your app, no issue from their perspective or relatively \u2013 that's more of a technical connectivity, how do we get it all done than a philosophical question. A number of the OTAs, online travel agencies, people are excited to have their inventory as part of the store. Don't really care whether it's on their site or our site. Again, they get the customer, they get the market of the customer, they get to email and otherwise own the customer for lifetime, so again happy with that side of OTAs. There's a handful of other online travel agencies that might prefer us not to change the model because they're perfectly happy getting the clicks themselves and preferring to drive more app downloads or other activities that they wouldn't necessarily get as much of a chance to do if we're taking a transaction. So, I think many are saying, well, we understand why you're doing this TripAdvisor. It is in the name of providing a better customer experience, so we'll give it a try. And clearly that's what we're looking for. We feel that a customer experience especially on the phone is something that we have to address. From our perspective there isn't really much of a choice in the matter and I think all of our clients are quite sympathetic to that line of reasoning.","Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Bo Nam - JP Morgan Chase & Co.","Hi. This is Bo Nam on for Doug. Thanks for taking our questions. A follow-up to the TV ad spend in 2014, do you see a strong correlation between the TV ad spend and hotel shopper growth and do you think that can help the growth once you pass your tougher comps in the first half of the year? And then kind of related to the traffic, when you think about the other parts of your traffic that are non-hotel, do you have any plans to further monetize that or be able to generate some growth from that? Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer","Certainly. To the question of TV driving hotel shopper growth, yes, we would expect meaningful campaigns to start to drive growth in hotel shoppers. There is just a lot of big numbers out there at the size of which we operate, it's a bit tough for TV to be able to drive a meaningful enough amount of domain direct traffic. Our challenge and the challenge of anyone viewing TV is being able to measure the overall lift. We're savvy enough or we believe we're savvy enough to want to look at TV spend and the overall branding spend on the much longer term basis. So when we made the decision to continue TV in 2014, we're looking at establishing more of a presence on TV as opposed to a big concentrated buy which in Q4 was October and November kind of specifically. And the reason we did that heavy concentration is because at a certain point of time, we would be able to best measure against our very large denominator of traffic how well that TV worked. Concentrating the buy in such a short period of time was not the smartest by way of driving the overall efficiencies but it did make it easier for us to measure which is why we did that. So going forward, now that we're able to measure, we're able to see a bunch of the lift that we were looking for. And while it's still a bit murky as to how TV has helped all the rest of our channels, we're believers to the point that we've allocated spend in 2014 going forward. It's always going to be little hard at predict for us to answer definitely, hey, how much was your TV spend \u2013 what portion of your hotel shopper growth is driven by your TV spend? We will certainly be learning more as we do and we'll be continuing to experiment in presumably some big markets and small markets to learn more and become more experts at the type of TV advertising that drives business in the travel channel. So the second question monetizing non-hotel traffic, certainly we have a lot of it, it is growing, it is extremely worldwide. We do have an eye on that category. We see it as kind of nothing but upside with very little in our plan currently in terms of being able to drive more revenue. We don't currently have internal metrics that revenue per non-hotel shopper sort of thing. You can tell we'll be much more (indiscernible) when I start to talk about metrics like that. But in the meantime, suffice it to say it is in our thinking. We recognize that there's a lot of traffic there but our hands are full. We have business listings coming out of meta, further optimizing the hotel shopper simply because it's a larger growth opportunity for us right now.","Bo Nam - JP Morgan Chase & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nat Schindler of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Nathaniel Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Hi. Thank you for taking my question. When you mentioned the revenue neutrality in December for meta, that was right in line with your original predictions, but much better than your predictions from last quarter. It sounds like that change occurred mostly on the pricing side. Have you done much to address the problem of breakage, which you mentioned as a headwind for you, as of last quarter?","Stephen Kaufer","When we were last on our call summarizing Q3, we were looking at an option that hadn't quite developed the way we had expected and it was a bit of a mystery to us as to whether pricing would recover to the level that we thought it should. After all we only have partial visibility and we had built our year plan around a much stronger recovery. By the time November rolled around, October-November \u2013 November specifically we had started to see some pricing increases and December saw a pretty nice lift using \u2013 again most price but some conversion using that revenue neutrality and stuff has continued to head in the right direction in January. The breakage \u2013 we didn't do anything specific to address the breakage. I think assisted book really takes care of the issue. We can theorize that the meta experience has pulled more people back to TripAdvisor for that second purchase and so we're benefiting a bit more from that. You can theorize that because we're showing all sorts of different pricing on the page and people are getting used to that, that people are sticking around and clicking three more, but we have to be honest with ourselves. We just don't know that part. We're thrilled that the leads as pricing would indicate are now at least as valuable if not more valuable than they were before as our metric of revenue per hotel shopper is up year-on-year at this point.","Nathaniel Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer","Certainly.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom White of Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Thomas White - Macquarie Research","Great. Thanks for taking my question. A couple on TripConnect. Maybe you could comment on how we should think about increased participation from some of the smaller hotels affecting CPC pricing in the auction, and I believe hotel needs to be a business listing subscriber to participate. So should we expect it to maybe impact that subscription revenue line before the CPC revenue line? And then just a clarification. If 2015, your main product focus is TripConnect, does that mean that there will be no sort of assisted booking path product on desktop next year? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. So I'll try to answer from my notes and then if I miss one, please pop back on. Small hotels do require business listing, independent hotels do require business listing in order to participate in TripConnect. That certainly does limit the opportunity at TripConnect for this point of time. We have over 65,000 properties that we've connected via Internet booking engines. So as an independent hotelier you are one of those 65,000, you can now go buy business listing if you don't already have one and start buying traffic on a CPC basis. We think for 2013 we probably had more of a lift from driving additional business listing sales than the actual CPC generated by the clients that had started CPC bidding in fourth quarter. We'll see what the net answer to that would be next year or 2014. And it's clearly our long-term goal to grow that number and establish those relationships with the independent hoteliers on a per click basis. So the 2015 is kind of TripConnect, the big product plan I'd say it is a piece of the long-term strategy to be able to establish ourselves as a major traffic in a booking driving channel for these independent hotels. I certainly wouldn't call it the only part of the product strategy for 2014 or '15 we have with a personalization initiative, we have many other things in the hopper. Assisted book we are fully committed to it for the phone in 2014 and we're saying, hey, we'll wait and see how it goes before we make any comments or commitments to ourselves as to launching that on other platforms. We're building it in such a way that if we wish to launch it on other platforms, we will be able to with a smaller amount of effort than the initial implementation on the phone. But it's really aiming at the phone that has been what's been driving the initiative. Monetization rate on the smartphone just isn't where it should be given the growth of traffic and the assisted book helps \u2013 we believe will help us get to more our fair share of those mobile transactions.","Thomas White - Macquarie Research","Good. Thanks for the call.","Stephen Kaufer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Diclemente of Nomura. Your line is now open.","Anthony Diclemente - Nomura Securities","Thanks a lot. Sorry, I guess, if I should know this but can you just remind me, does the hotel shopper metric include users to TripAdvisor's native applications?","Stephen Kaufer","Great question. As we look at that it does include shoppers on the TripAdvisor mobile website but due to essentially some challenges around the moving from \u2013 how to explain it \u2013 we had over the course of the year a native app that was partially what's called a web view. So it uses some web pages as part of the app and so those were counted naturally I believe as part of the hotel shopper metric. When we launched the full native app, for those that downloaded the full native app, those would not be included in the hotel shopper metric. It's not that they shouldn't be but because technically we're not able to do that at this moment in time. Hotel shoppers also don't include our hotel shoppers on Daodao, our China website. They don't include to the best of my recollection or need of shopper on Android as well as iPhone\u2026","Anthony Diclemente - Nomura Securities","I guess what I'm getting at is \u2013 for people you mentioned the tough comp but for people who are asking about the deceleration in hotel shoppers, isn't it safe to say that there is some mobile app-only users of TripAdvisor that are not being captured in the year-over-year growth rate? And that's what could be an explanation for modest deceleration in the hotel shopper metric?","Stephen Kaufer","That's certainly a fair point and that would certainly account for a bit. Again, the factors in there are the amount of our mobile usage app versus web and the timing over which people move from the partial native app to the full native app and we didn't go back and look at that. When we report in \u2013 over Q1 as we will have had a full quarter of fully native, I think we will have a bunch of that tracked at that point and a great question to revisit. But the short answer is I think you're right. I'm missing some hotel shoppers from that number there.","Anthony Diclemente - Nomura Securities","Great. Thanks. One more quick follow-up, if I may. Steve, can you just update us on how investors should be thinking about Liberty's decision to spin its stake? If you can just maybe update us on the timing and talk about the outcome there. Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer","I don't really sort of pay much attention to it. They're a wonderful controlling shareholder for us. There's an entity changed there and it's kind of nothing on the part of TripAdvisor. So we'll see what happens. I'm not sure what the latest rumors are for when the time \u2013 the final meeting's at. Ask Liberty directly.","Anthony Diclemente - Nomura Securities","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Stephen Kaufer","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Naved Kahn of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Naved Kahn - Cantor Fitzgerald","Yes, thanks. Just on the marketing and selling expense, if we X out the \u2013 if we normalize for the TV spending, how does the marketing efficiency look like? And then I had a follow-up.","Julie M. B. Bradley","So are you talking about for clarifying the question, 2013 or 2014?","Naved Kahn - Cantor Fitzgerald","Specifically Q4 of 2013, if we normalize for the TV ad spending, if you did, how does the marketing efficiency look like?","Julie M. B. Bradley","If you were to, as we had said, a significant amount of our TV advertising was spent in the fourth quarter as we were very focused on testing and trail. So we weren't looking for a meaningful uplift in revenue during that testing period. If we were to exclude that I think that would have got to straight to the bottom line and you'd see either our margins closer to previous quarters.","Naved Kahn - Cantor Fitzgerald","And then I was looking for some color on the \u2013 in terms of your return on your advertising if you would not have spent on TV, but more on maybe like China.","Stephen Kaufer","So I think if we had not spent on TV mostly that money would have dropped to the bottom line. We already spent in our other channels at a pretty aggressive rate, so certainly we could have used the dollars to spend at a loss in other channels but that would be contrary to the direction that we always had.","Naved Kahn - Cantor Fitzgerald","Understood. And then second question on the recent settlement in Europe between Google and the antitrust regulators, any commentary around that and the impact on your business?","Stephen Kaufer","I'm not particularly happy with the current proposed settlement and we hope that \u2013 since there is nothing formal yet, we still have hopes that something more reasonable will be reached.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks for taking the question. A quick one, Steve, can you offer us some color on regional trends? Thanks very much.","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. We generally don't go into too much detail on the regions. We have commented that the U.S. and UK were looking stronger. I guess that's against our forecast. And where you see in general around the world sort of macroeconomic challenges, we absolutely see those in both traffic and CPC levels. So, people still love to shop for travel but where there's a high unemployment or a deteriorating economy, the shoppers even though they may click to our partners, it's such a lower CPC to us and so those markets are just harder. And so I'm not sure I'm explaining anything particularly helpful there, but that's all the color that we provide.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities","No worries. Quick follow-up, if I could. Should we assume that consistent with prior commentary that large global events like World Cup would not provide any sort of meaningful contribution?","Stephen Kaufer","No, we tend to look at those large scale events as more likely to be a negative than a positive. So the Summer Olympics, people stay home and watch the games more so than the people who are travelling to the games. I know this is little counterintuitive but that's what we've experienced over the Summer Olympics. I don't think the World Cup will have nearly the effect, it's just not as big an event. Similarly the Winter Olympics would be a much smaller thing. So net-net, those outside of the Summer Olympics, specific holidays, festivals, World Cup tend to be too small for us to bother forecasting again.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities","Great, helpful. Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company","Hi. Thanks. Just a question on business listings. Can you tell us how you think about that opportunity? When you look at the 775,000 hotels on your platform, what percentage do you think are appropriate for that product? And then can you give us a little more color on the value-based pricing that you rolled out? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. So we have out of the 775,000 plus hotels and again separate from all the vacation rentals we have, these are just hotels in these. Last I checked over 300,000 of those were registered owners, so we got a lot of them already in our data base registered interacting with us and kind of that 69,000 subscribers as of the beginning of the year. So we feel we'll never get to all 775,000 of them but as the site grows, as more and more owners want to read the reviews of the property on their site, we have that as the touch point. That touch point yields an engaged owner. If the properties are really terribly rated, we don't call them up and ask for a subscription. And most properties on TripAdvisor are in the good to very good to great range and that makes for an exciting prospect for our sales reps to call. So as we continue to grow traffic, as we continue to grow brand, as our stickers continue to be placed in windows and plaques and hotels all around the globe, all of that drives more and more interest in business listing. So our sales force is now very much worldwide, very much multilingual. We see continued growth there, so we don't feel we're tapping out in any way, shape or form on the opportunity of business listing. And as you can appreciate it, it's a subscription business so revenue keeps recurring. The value-based prices was just \u2013 we improved the mechanism by which we price the properties from more based upon whether the city was a popular one to the particular value that we're delivering for a particular property. And the value for the property is a combination of look, what is their ADR, what's their average daily rate for the property, how many rooms do they have, how important is TripAdvisor as a part of their business. Do we drive a lot of page views in their property or very small because it's much lower in length that's on our site. And so when we changed to our value-based pricing which we put in place last October, we saw a price \u2013 an overall price increase which reflected not only the increased value because more visitors are coming to TripAdvisor every month looking at all these properties but it also just \u2013 it was a fairer way to price the product because the hotels that could afford it, there were seeing clear value, getting a lot of traffic, ended up paying more and the price went down on some properties and the new pricing prospects was more value based was lower where it needed to be where TripAdvisor wasn't driving enough page views. We think we have a pretty good place right now, so there will also be some tweaking, there's some clients in the last year that would have based much higher price increases but we chose to cap the increase in order to preserve the hotelier relationship. So will continue to tweak but we think we're in a pretty good state right now.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Brian Nowak of Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","Brian Nowak - Susquehanna Financial Group","Thanks. I have two; one for Steve and one for Julie. The first one, Steve, just to go back to Anthony's question, roughly how big is that hotel shopper number now? Just so we can kind of better understand the long runway ahead and how small it is and how much growth potential there is in there going forward? How big are you on an absolute basis just roughly now? And then secondly, Julie, in the past you've given very helpful ranges on the size of mobile and international and meta headwinds. Something in mobile got a little bit worse and meta clearly got better. How big were those headwinds and tailwinds in 4Q? And how should we think about 2014 and kind of what's embedded in the guidance? Thanks so much.","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. So I'll start. We generally consider the traffic for a site to be about half and half. Half to hotel shoppers, half looking to either plan the rest of the trip or looking around at what to do or where to eat locally. So I think about half and half and we already shared kind of the 2 billion unique visitor number that Google Analytics reports.","Julie M. B. Bradley","On the bridge side, we didn't give the exact specifics of those ranges but I would say they are consistent with what we have been discussing all year with the international and mobile continuing to be a drag on hotel shopper growth in the 5% to 10% range. We did call out that the mobile drag has intensified and just because of the overall strength in mobile growth we're still monetizing it at a variable rate. This past quarter we had some favorable tailwind with some FX that's about a 1.5 point. And on the meta side when we last spoke in October we were clearly seeing that it was continuing to be a drag on hotel shopper growth as compared to text link [ph] revenue. But we did hit a neutrality in December and that's really calculated when we look at revenue per hotel shopper that's a trough in Q3 and then recovered nicely at the end of the year following into \u2013 we're still continuing to see it today. And then the other aspect of it I'd add was some onsite conversion. So I think that sums it up for Q4. Looking at 2014, we still expect to see headwinds from international and mobile we hope with assisted book on mobile rolling out in 2014 that will help improve monetization rates and decreasing the amount of the drag. And meta moving forward especially as we lap the rollout should be a positive.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Steve Kaufer for any closing comments.","Stephen Kaufer","All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. It was a great year for the business and we're headed down on making the product even better in 2014. We look forward to updating everyone on our progress in the next few months. Thanks much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to TripAdvisor's Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Will Lyons. Please go ahead.","Will Lyons - Vice President of Investor Relations & Revenue Analytics","Thanks, Esther. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Steve Kaufer, our CEO; and Ernst Teunissen, our CFO.","Last night after market close, we distributed and filed our Q2 earnings release as well as made available our prepared remarks on our Investor Relations website located at ir.tripadvisor.com. In the release, you will find reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures discussed on this call. Also, our IR website contains a supplemental financial information document which includes certain non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call as well as other performance metrics.","Instead of reading our prepared remarks on this call, Steve will provide a couple of thoughts and Ernst will follow-up as well, and we'll talk about our recent progress and then we'll jump right into Q&A.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that this call may contain estimates and other forward-looking statements that represent the company's view as of today, August 4, 2016.

Thank you for joining the call. Hopefully you've had a chance to read our prepared remarks that we published last night after market close. I'll summarize by saying that we continue to grow content and community, especially on mobile devices. We are operating the business with a long-term forward-looking view, and we continue to leverage these competitive strengths as we create a stickier end-to-end user experience throughout all phases of travel planning, booking and trip taking.","We're pleased with the progress that we made in the second quarter along our key initiatives. Instant booking is now live across the globe, and we continue to improve our booking capabilities not only in hotels, but in attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals.","Ernst?","Ernst J. Teunissen - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Steve, and hello, everyone. I'll just add that these initiatives come with visible near-term revenue and profit headwinds as anticipated and also as communicated at the outset of the year.","We continue to navigate a dynamic travel landscape and we believe we're on the best path to drive long-term shareholder value.","With that, we'll open it up for our questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, guys. I had a couple of questions. First one is around mobile. You talk about better book rates coming out of mobile and you highlight versus other devices. When you say other devices, is that both desktop and tablets? So, just a little clarification there. And then wondering if there's any dynamics to call out with the Samsung relationship and how that's progressing?","Ernst J. Teunissen - Chief Financial Officer","I'll take the first question. Yes, against other devices, that includes the desktop and tablet. Mobile is really our best performer in that case.","Stephen Kaufer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And thanks, Brian, for the question. The Samsung relationship generated a number of pre-installs many years ago, but I wouldn't characterize that as a critical partnership even back then, and certainly not going forward. We appreciate all the installs. We have hundreds of millions of them, but that's a small piece of our mobile puzzle.","Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Two, if I can: one on desktop shoppers and one on mobile. First, it looks like desktop hotel shopper growth was negative, so wondering if you saw that across markets or maybe if certain markets like North America where revenue accelerated, was desktop shopper growth holding up okay? Any color you can provide on that or whether this is kind of structural or temporary would be helpful. And then secondly on mobile, you guys called out app hotel shoppers and revenue both growing at a strong 50%, but it seems like that would imply mobile monetization, which has been improving a lot that didn't grow much this quarter in terms of revenue per shopper in app. So wondering if we're interpreting that correctly, and can you kind of walk us through what may have slowed the progress there; how do you think it can reverse out? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, thank you, Lloyd. In terms of number of shoppers and the geo split in that, we've seen weakness across the world in all markets, and especially we called out into the back half of the quarter, we've not seen the usual holiday spike or summer spike that we would have seen and that was across geographies. Having said that, especially earlier on the quarter, outside of the United States, in all of those markets where we rolled out instant booking, we perhaps saw a larger impact that is in part driven by the fact that we can spend less as we saw the impact of instant booking. But hotel shopping is not completely isolated to outside the U.S.","Your second question on mobile monetization, we did see year-on-year improvement of revenue per shopper in mobile. Mobile revenue grew at about 30%. Our shopper count was up a little over 23% in mobile, so that implies an improved monetization for the mobile.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is now open.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you so much. Maybe two questions around the sales and marketing efforts of the company. Just wanted to understand a little bit better on ROI and what you might be seeing or how you can help us understand some of the discounting or incentives you put in place in the letter commentary you sort of laid out that the shift away from TV advertising that's sort of moved into those incentives on property to get people to book the first time. Maybe we can understand a little bit how that's progressing, what kind of returns you're getting and what it might mean for how you spend on the sales and market line in the back part of the year. Thanks so much.","Stephen Kaufer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Thanks for the question. This is Steve. We certainly have been trying a number of different promotions; anything from sweepstakes to an Amazon Gift Card to discount on an attraction once you booked a hotel. They're all just different ways that we're both driving home, TripAdvisor is a place that you can now book the hotel, not just read the reviews.","So to be clear, part of that kind of promotional goal is really building the brand around, this is a place you can book. And part of it certainly serves to drive that first time booker or second time booker into the flow because we have our evidence that says once we get someone to book once, they're more likely to come back and book again. And if we can get them to book once or book twice on the app, for instance, it becomes an even stronger habit. And that's what we're looking to build over time, figure out the set of users, a large set of users that already trust us for our reviews and push them into trusting us for that booking experience. And we have great scores of when we measure how people feel about the booking experience once they've gone through it.","So, the promotions are taking some of the dollars that we had spent in TV. We feel, as I've said before, that leveraging the vast amount of traffic we have globally that's already on our site is simply a more efficient way for us to get our message out there than some of the other off-line activities. It doesn't really tell you much on \u2013 I'm not really able to tell you much on the relative spend for those type of programs in the back half of the year, other than to point out what I think is fairly straightforward. Those aren't anywhere near the materiality of the TV spend even in the lightweight ways we were doing it last year.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Perry Gold with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.","Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Can you provide an update on where we are in terms of conversion rates for instant booking versus metasearch, maybe by either geography or device and how we should be thinking about that pace of improvement? Is that 20% uplift on desktop in the U.S. for IB likely to be representative in terms of the pace of growth for IB conversion on mobile or maybe in other regions? Thanks so much.","Ernst J. Teunissen - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. We've said before and this is still the case that conversion rates in the U.S. have been converging and are similar to the conversion rates in meta. We've seen very good results there. We see continued evidence of the monetization gap narrowing. Outside of the U.S. in all those markets that we launched in the second quarter, we've seen, as expected, what we saw early on in the United States as well, that the conversion rates are lower as there is much larger gap compared to the U.S. And we believe there's a lot of low-hanging fruit that we have to improve those conversion rates over time and like in the U.S., hopefully, ultimately see conversion rates that are more similar.","Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The standard sort of test and learn that we're doing, we know will drive improved conversion rates over time in each of our markets. We also get the benefit of the repeat bookers coming back. And those folks obviously have been around the longest in the U.S., so they have a higher conversion rate and haven't been around as much in some of our newer markets. So, we'll see the overall conversion rate for IB climb in our newer markets over time anyways because we're simply pulling back people that have already tried it, already liked it.","On the app is where we continue to be most excited because that's the best spot to build a habit. And when we look at building a habit for someone that travels once, maybe twice a year, it's just less interesting to us than the more frequent traveler who can now, with the stored credit card on the app, open up the app and make a booking, go and it's really simple. It's really easy. We have tremendous coverage in most markets, and that kind of habit enables that device and enables that value proposition to continue to grow for us. And so we'd expect to see continued, on average, conversion improvements because frankly, we're attracting our repeat visitors more and more often. But that does take quarters and years to build.","Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC","Great. Thanks, Steve.","Stephen Kaufer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Hey. Good morning. You had a significant uptick in number of bookable products on Viator. And at this point, how would you describe the impact on monetization from that uptick in bookability versus just being a resource for information on tours and attractions with limited ability to monetize? And then I guess what's the reaction from tour and attraction partners to instant book? I'd think it would be positive, given they may be less concerned than hotels about retaining brand awareness, et cetera. Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. That's a great question. Mike, thank you very much. The Viator's been doing this for quite a while, so we've picked up a lot of the popular tours and activities over the years, but there's hundreds of thousands more that want to be online, may have their own website but haven't yet connected to any platform like ours. And TripAdvisor has over 600,000 things to do and locations. Many of those places sell tickets and would love the ability to have the booking from our end. So that's the whole story around the attractions.","To the second part of your question, I've just haven't ever heard of an attraction owner saying, no, I don't like the notion of instant booking because it takes away from that branded experience. Because as you point out, the attraction is much less likely to be a repeat visit than the hotel, so the attraction is much less interested in building that direct loyalty. They want to make sure their attraction is highly rated, highly visible on Trip, easily bookable, best inventory, most available inventory. And our biggest challenge, frankly, is just getting the pipes, all that connectivity working for as many attractions as we can and then back to the consumer side on TripAdvisor, teaching folks that not only can they figure out the things that they want to do; they can book it. They can book it on desktop. And more importantly, in our long-term view, they can book it on their phone when they are in market. And that's that whole instant booking attraction picture.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Peck with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Robert S. Peck - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yes. Thank you so much. Two quick questions, please. One, when we look at the click-based revenue, it decelerated slightly to I think down about 15%. In the last quarter, you were helpful breaking out some of the headwinds that you saw, whether it be seasonality, macro or the insta-book transition. I was wondering if you could maybe go through that and help break out what you saw there in those various components.","And then, Ernst, as we think about 2017 and what could be more of a normalized growth rate on the top line or stabilized margins, that would be helpful as well. Thanks so much.","Ernst J. Teunissen - Chief Financial Officer","So if you look at revenue per shopper, the story is somewhat similar as in the previous quarters. So the largest impact on the year-on-year decrease of revenue per shopper is the instant booking dilution. We have obviously now been in market outside of the U.S., U.K., where we were before in for a complete three months in the second quarter, and that has made a significant impact. That's both, as a reminder, a booked revenue issue as well as a rev rec issue in instant booking. So that's a large one.","The second in revenue per shopper is the shift to mobile. We've seen a faster shift in mobile than we anticipated in the second quarter. And this continues to be a drag on the aggregated revenue per shopper number. As we said before, revenue per shopper of mobile is increasing, but is substantially lower than on desktop, and therefore with the mix shift, a reduction of the overall.","We have also in the second quarter had tougher meta comps compared to a year ago. We called that out earlier. That's a front half issue. That will abate, that will ease in the second part of the quarter. We've also called out that we did see some softness particularly in June and into July, which we think might be impacted by the macro environment, by the various events that we've seen around the world, be it terror-related or economic events like Brexit, and we believe that has made an impact on us as well, on the volume side, on the number of shoppers side, and perhaps also on the revenue per shopper side.","Your second part of the question about 2017, in February we made some statements painting a picture for the shape of 2016, but also into 2017. We have no reason to update that today, but I also don't want to put a finer point to that. The teams here internally will start to shift over the next month, a more detailed planning for 2017, and when the time is right, we'll provide you some appropriate comments about 2017.","Robert S. Peck - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Yeah, hi. Thank you. Just a couple of questions. Steve, maybe you can give us some more color on the shopper growth and how it might be affected by the spend on the variable advertising channels. It looks like you're spending more on promotions related to instant book. Is that taking away from the spending on traffic acquisition and maybe even hurting the metasearch?","Stephen Kaufer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Naved. I'll try and answer. So, the basic variable marketing channels that we've traditionally used, the standard ones, continue apace, no fundamental change in how we approach them. With the rev per shopper decline that impacts based upon our ROI neutral approach to those channels, it impacts how much we're able to bid in those channels. So you've seen we believe a partial decline in the hotel shopper growth because of a lower ability to spend in those channels. I wouldn't call out the promotions as \u2013 well, I'm telling you the promotions are not coming at the expense of the variable marketing channels. They are marketing dollars that we are choosing to spend to build up the brand of TripAdvisor as a trusted place to book, but I would caution against thinking of it, as I mentioned before, in the same magnitude as TV, because it's not.","Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Understood. And then just to follow up, can you just talk about the dynamic for the meta-auction in the second quarter? Was there any impact from Expedia under-indexing in the channel? They talked about that on their earnings call.","Stephen Kaufer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. We had heard that, and from our seat, we're kind of used to various partners, big ones and small ones, having small to medium changes in how they act quarter on quarter on quarter. So Expedia may have been talking about a little bit different approach or different stuff this quarter. We see it but other partners also change their large bids from time to time. I wouldn't view it as the most relevant thing in our overall model. Pricing overall impacts our CPC auction. We continue to make revenue optimization headwinds. And we look at the macro issues impacting online travel as another aspect that can both affect revenue per shopper as well as total shoppers coming in the store.","Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. In your prepared remarks, you, I think, Ernst, you said that you're now live in \"substantively all your major markets.\" Wondering if you could help us understand when from a timing perspective you might be experiencing maximum IB transition headwinds and when that curve might start improving. Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - Chief Financial Officer","So in terms of rollout, as we said, this second quarter was really the quarter that we had the full three-month impact of the IB rollout globally. As we've said over time, we've made improvements in the United States, but this is really the initial rollout outside of the U.S. and the UK and the full impact of that. We believe that as we go forward, as we enter in this Phase three and Phase four that we were describing in our prepared remarks, we hopefully should be able to make improvements to our offering and improve our conversion rates over time.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. And if I could, one more, do you think IB conversion rates could ever exceed meta? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","This is Steve. I certainly do believe that IB rates can and sometimes do exceed meta. It very much depends on the property, the type of traveler. I'll give you a very simple case in point. If a user is looking for a relatively straightforward stay, low research intent vacation, staying three nights in a Best Western, the conversion rates are really quite high and near as we can tell higher than the downstream meta. It kind of makes sense. It's a simple transaction. TripAdvisor is giving you plenty of information and there's not a big reason to shop around. But the week's stay in Cancun where you're looking for a lot more information and sometimes, information that frankly, TripAdvisor doesn't quite have in the form that you're looking for, then instant booking is not converting as well as meta.","So, I certainly understand your question. And when we think over time, yes, we do believe instant booking can and should always be able to be better if our pricing is good than a meta click. And when we look on average, we see in the U.S. app, we're already there. But again, the on-average already better than meta is a great statement. I still drill it down to different segments of properties and different segments of trips because we want to make sure it's not on-average great; it's great in every different situation that we come across.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the questions. First, I just wanted to go back to North America and the revenue growth there accelerated a little bit in 2Q. Just wanted to understand the acceleration better and I guess just in particular, how much is the lapping some of the instant book impact versus some of the conversion improvements in areas where you're doing better? And then secondly, could you just talk a little bit about your strategy for determining when you're showing instant book and kind of when you're moving it up and down the page kind of through the booking process? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - Chief Financial Officer","I'll take the first part of that question. So, the geo split that you see is the first thing to point out is a mix across our entire business. So, it includes TripAdvisor auction revenue, but it also includes, obviously, other hotel brands as well as attractions, vacation rentals, etc. But having said that, across the board, and also in our TripAdvisor core, our revenue performance in the U.S. has been better than outside of the U.S. for a number of reasons; most importantly, that we are frankly much further along in driving improvements in our instant booking offering. We've seen lapping of things that we did last year and we've seen significant improvements we've made in conversion in the United States. So we're very pleased with that, and we see very good performance there.","If you compare that to EMEA in our breakout and APAC and LATAM, you can see that the trends are different there. That is a function of the rollout that we have just done. And you also see in addition that particularly in LATAM and APAC we've seen weakness. So if you were to ask us where in the portfolio have you seen strong performance and less strong performance in the second quarter on a year-on-year basis, clearly, U.S. stronger performer, mobile a strong performer, and outside the U.S., Europe weaker and especially outside of Europe, LATAM and APAC weaker.","Stephen Kaufer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And this is Steve. You are wise to point out that change in the IB, instant book presentation on the website, as internally we call it flexing the user interface, to show instant book where we think it's truly the best offering for the consumer and not fully deprecating but lowering its visibility when we don't think that's going to make for a successful experience. We were perhaps a little too ambitious when we rolled it out originally, putting IB top, front and center no matter what the price was in IB and no matter how appropriate IB was for what the user was looking for, looking back to that example of a Best Western purchase versus a week in Cancun.","Now when you look at our site, again, depending on the market, you'll see instant book positioned as a terrific option if it's the right property and the right price, and you'll actually see it float in a different spot depending possibly on whether you've booked on TripAdvisor before. So the team did a terrific job helping to figure out when instant book is likely to be successful and when meta is actually a better offering or a better choice for that traveler at that point in time. The traveler, as they go through their journey, in fact, sometimes is more interested in a meta click-off for looking at more information, sometimes more interested in just finishing the booking right there because the price is the same and the purchase path is simple.","So, again, I would suggest if you care to continue to look at the site because we expect to continue to look and optimize where and when you see instant booking, again, per our mission, helping that traveler plan and book the perfect trip, what are the right times when we're going to see it. The really nice thing, and then I'll end my point, is that as we have flexed the user interface to show meta or IB at the right time, we've increased our revenue and we have not had a meaningful drop in our instant bookings, because fundamentally we're lowering its visibility in cases where we weren't converting anyone anyways. So in this case, the team, again, nice job because we're getting our revenue back, which helps our traffic acquisition and our overall top line, and we're not losing on the instant book trial piece, which furthers our building a habit using instant book strategy.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. That's helpful color. Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Merwin with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right, great. Thanks. I just had a couple questions. So first, I think the commentary is still that we're working kind of an upward shape in the revenue curve for the back half of the year. Is that going to be mainly driven by revenue per hotel shopper or also a pickup in hotel shoppers as well?","And then just a second question, I think, still we sometimes see a difference in price between instant book and meta, and if you wouldn't mind just reminding us I guess how that works and to what extent, like, a lower price on instant book is helping conversion? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, and as you all know, we don't provide a formal guidance, but we have made the comments that \u2013 a few comments. One is we see our comps easing in the second half. This is the comps from the IB rollout but also from the meta comps that we have highlighted before. We're also commenting though that there are recent softer trends that we have highlighted, and they make us more cautious as we look at the rest of the year.","Stephen Kaufer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi. And then to answer the pricing question, the instant book price is, generally speaking, the best price that we get from all of our instant booking partners, which is frequently the hotel itself, chain or independent, and then likely one or more of the Priceline companies and then perhaps another or a different OTA.","But many times, that instant book price is not actually the best price in our meta auction, and so since travelers the world over care most or care hugely about price, when our instant book price is not the best price, we're generally not featuring it at the top of the page, because we know it's not what users are going to want the most.","Our goal is to continue to sign up independent hotels, chains, online travel agencies, resellers, every possible partner who is able to take the booking for a hotel, so that when you come to TripAdvisor and use the instant book product, you will see TripAdvisor having as good a price as any of our meta partners, and frankly, as anyone across the web has.","And so we measure \u2013 getting technical here, we measure the meet, beat, lose ratio of how our instant book price compares to our own meta auction to know how many times a smart traveler should be picking the instant book option because it is equal to the best price in the meta auction.","Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom White with Macquarie Capital. Your line is now open.","Tom White - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Steve, you just touched on ramping hotel supply, both via independents and chains as well as OTAs. Can you maybe give us a sense of how many direct hotel relationships or contracts you guys have and maybe how quickly that's growing?","And then just secondly, on conversion rate, there's some discussion of conversion rates for IB versus meta. I'm curious to know whether there's a meaningful difference in conversion rate for IB when the connectivity or the booking is processed by an independent versus one of the large OTAs like met booking (33:28). Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Tom. Two good questions. We're not at the point to release total supply and direct supply numbers. I think we've talked about having the vast majority of the chains on board and we have quite a few independent properties.","One of the nice points of that independent property piece is that so many of them are hearing about us through their channel partner or aware of us because they're responding to reviews, and so they're actually going through our self-service module to sign up. And if that independent hotel uses an Internet booking engine that we support, and we support well over a hundred now, it's pretty easy for that property to come on in, put in their credit card, hit a few buttons and away they go. And then they're able to take direct bookings via TripAdvisor.","And, again, they like it, feedback is good. We've had the desire, the strongest desire, to be as broad as we can with instant booking, so our natural focus has been the big chains, because they can bring on thousands of properties at once, and of course the big OTAs. And, we're in super-partnership with the Priceline brands and so you've seen both not only Booking.com but also Priceline and Agoda appear in our auctions not only in the U.S. but in many more markets as well. And as we expand all of that inventory through that OTA relationship, we're delivering instant book to more customers in more languages.","So the question of the instant book conversion via supplier direct versus an OTA, it's a little hard for us to measure simply because it's an apples to oranges. The big chain supply we have tends to be the big names, the high confidence and, in general, those tend to convert quite well, oftentimes better than a good OTA partner, because there is some, near as we can tell, some brand preference for the supplier direct. It's a little more nuanced when it comes to the individual properties signing up, whether the consumer preference is an OTA versus the independent.","I'd leave you with the generalized statement that if the independent or the supplier direct has excellent content in our system, so good room descriptions, good photos and absolutely have equal pricing, then the supplier is likely to get a higher share of the bookings. When we ask ourselves what matters the most? I want to be very clear, it's price. And so hoteliers who are very good at making sure their own website has the best pricing and that's what's shown on our site, reap the benefits of that. Where pricing is variable across different partners, then the hotel itself will lose some of the bookings, because consumers prefer the cheapest price, simply put.","Tom White - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital. Your line is now open.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. You talked a couple of times about the mobile monetization gap and I just wanted to get back to it and ask a couple of basic questions. How big is the gap between mobile and desktop and tablet monetization? What's the trend like? What do you think are the basic factors causing that gap? And do you think that that's just inevitable that long-term that that closes or gets eliminated? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. The monetization gap that we currently have, so mobile monetizes roughly at about 30% of...","Stephen Kaufer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Phone.","Ernst J. Teunissen - Chief Financial Officer","Sorry?","Stephen Kaufer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Phone.","Ernst J. Teunissen - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, phone not mobile, not the tablets. The phone monetizes roughly at 30%, a third of desktop. And we've seen that improve over time. It's better today than it was a year ago. And we continue to believe that we're well positioned to continue to make improvements and really lead with our mobile product. So as we think into the future, we do anticipate that we see further conversions of the monetization of the phone and desktop. Where that will exactly land is a little difficult to predict at this point.","Stephen Kaufer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I'd caution folks that sometimes when you hear us and others talk about mobile, it includes tablet. We try to be clear when we talk about our phone monetization being a third because tablet for us looks pretty close to desktop.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","But, qualitatively, could you talk to the factors that are going to cause that gap to narrow over time?","Stephen Kaufer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. I think \u2013 this is Steve \u2013 absolutely the biggest factor is the consumer building habit and the expectations of being able to book with us on the app. So there's the macro, and I think almost every travel company at least will talk about how the phone bookings monetize less per booking than desktop because the phone is still used, at least in my opinion, for the lower decision support purchases. It's the easier hotel. It's the one night. It's you know what you want. There's less research involved. And the heavier, more expensive purchases are happening; the less commoditized purchases still are happening more on the desktop. As users' comfort grow on the phone, as phone apps become even better, that will lessen and the average price of what is booked on the phone will come closer to desktop. Average price is a good proxy for average amount that any of us make on those bookings.","For us, the habit of booking and rebooking and rebooking on the phone, on the app specifically is going to be what we believe drives our future monetization model. We are in \u2013 we kind of have the best of many worlds because we have this awesome meta price comparison engine on any device that allows the traveler to make sure they're getting the best deal. And we've moved into the transaction business so that they don't have to go anywhere else to get that best deal. They can book on TripAdvisor.","If you believe, as we do that it's going to be an app world, to many it's already an app world. The Facebook it's already an app world, but in that sort of travel purchase, it's moving in that direction, our app being able to help people find what they're looking for, make sure they're getting the best price, click off in a meta model if they're not getting the best price. Use their store credit card to easily book when we do have the best price, so that they made the travel research, they made the travel purchase. Now they're taking TripAdvisor on the road with them in that single app to deliver that next experience of, what am I going to do when I'm going to get there? How am I going to \u2013 where am I going to eat? How can I make all those reservations? And that app world means my overall revenue per shopper, a) gets amortized over all the different stuff we sell, not just hotels; but b) building that habit because we've earned the spot on your phone, makes that monetization because of the repeat usage that much better over time.","And it's true that on TripAdvisor desktop, we've been phenomenally blessed with so much traffic, so much trust, and so much awareness around the globe, but the desktop website isn't as sticky. It's been our challenge to get people who do the price comparison on Trip, who read the reviews on Trip to not immediately pop over and book somewhere else such that we've completely lost the credit. And that's not a complaint against any of our partners that we deserve all that credit. We're trying as hard as they are to correctly attribute the credit to us.","On the app with instant booking, we don't have that challenge anymore because we've built the habit, people come back and finish their booking right on Trip.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Ernst.","Stephen Kaufer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nat Schindler with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Nat H. Schindler - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Yes. Hi. If you look at your, revenue per hotel shopper was down, seen mostly from instant book. But wouldn't it be down considerably just from mix shift as desktop shrank from mobile? And how much of that difference would there be?","Ernst J. Teunissen - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. You're correct. So if you look at the drivers in sort of order of importance, the number one driver was the instant booking impact in the second quarter, consisting both of the booked revenue impact from the lower monetization IB, as well as from the revenue recognition. The number two driver indeed was the shift from desktop to the phone. And we're not sizing the individual impacts of all those drivers, but it was a significant impact.","Nat H. Schindler - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","And just a quick follow-up to that. How much is \u2013 just on IB, what is the difference in monetization between desktop and mobile?","Ernst J. Teunissen - Chief Financial Officer","We're not breaking out that in specifics. We've said overall the monetization on the phone is 30%, one-third of meta. We're not breaking that down between IB on the phone or IB on the desktop.","Nat H. Schindler - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","What we like about that phone aspect is we continue to see our best repeat rates on the app. We continue to see the strength of the habit; kind of more people booking four and five times on the phone than on mobile web or desktop. And if you look at the app experience versus mobile web or desktop, you see that we're pushing harder on instant book as the best and easiest option.","When you look at the folks who are logged in, already members on the app, huge, huge percentage of people that are clearly identifying themselves as TripAdvisor members and happy to book. Combine that with the constant increase in credit card storage, the constant repeat bookings, and it takes time, but we're pretty happy with how that picture is shaping up on the app.","We're going to face, to be clear, a continued headwind of the shift over to mobile because even though our mobile monetization rate is growing and the app usage is looking really strong, it's still coming from such a smaller rev per shopper base than desktop. But that's one of the reasons why we launched IB or the whole concept of instant book in the first place was to kind of solve this problem so that we'd be in a phenomenally strong position in the app world in a few years.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman with Cowen & Co. Your line is now open.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask about the softness in June and July. Can you give us any sense of the relative size of the softness this year when compared to the slowdown in meta auction pricing that you saw in June and July last year? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. I don't want to put a finer point on it than we've already done. We did see, as we called out, a softness really into June more than in April and May in the particular quarter, and we've seen that softness continue into July. And as I said before, usually we see a very significant spike in June and July that is seasonal. We've seen that much to a lesser extent this year.","We've talked about what we believe are some of the headwinds that we're looking at. It's difficult to size the total impact of macro. We've seen obviously impacts, localized impacts in the particular markets that were impacted, and we can size those to some extent, but we believe there's something larger going on in the travel environment that is harder to quantify.","So we've seen that in June and July. When we say when we look at the rest of the year that we're more cautious, it is really because it is difficult for us to forecast how much of that June, July weakness is going to persist throughout the end of the year, and that's the reason for our cautiousness.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, Ernst.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks. So Steve, 0.5 million bookable hotel properties now. Any way to characterize the number of rooms? And when you are pretty much done getting full adoption of IB, what do you think the bookable property count and the room count will look like? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Steve. So because of the Priceline Group relationship and the fact that we have all of their inventory, I'd say the bookable properties number is huge. It covers just about everything we want, because you think of how strong the Priceline Group companies are, covering basically most interesting bookable hotels.","We've always looked at our meta auction by, hey, as a percentage of page views, how many of the properties that we have do we have a commerce link for? And that number has been quite steady for several years, and I think the number now that we have is 0.5 million bookable properties is going to be pretty steady.","Priceline generally has most, if not all of the rooms at a property, so we don't generally go down to the kind of room level count. But if you think of our inventory as the super set of the Priceline brands plus the Expedia affiliate network brands via Tingo plus Getaroom plus the other suppliers that we've signed up, in total bookable properties, I can kind of say \u2013 at least in English, I can kind of say checkmark, got all that matter.","I can't say checkmark yet on, do we have the best price on all those properties? Because Priceline is strong as they are on pricing, doesn't always have the best price, and that's why people generally shop around on the net. They're very, very good at it, but TripAdvisor has the opportunity to be even better because when Priceline has a great price for property, we can take from them. When the hotel itself has a better price, we can take the price from them and they can both be instant book partners.","So I wouldn't look at or I don't care much about at this point the trajectory of bookable properties. I care more about how we're doing by way of content and pricing for those properties and then the expansion into as many languages as we can support.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse","Thank you.","Operator","At this time I'm showing no further questions, I would like to turn the call back over to Steve Kaufer for any closing remarks.","Stephen Kaufer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining the call. I want to thank all of our employees around the globe for their continued hard work. Everyone's doing a great job for us. We appreciate that.

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to TripAdvisor's Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Will Lyons. Please go ahead.","Will Lyons - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thanks, Steven. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our call. Joining me today are Steve Kaufer, our CEO; and Ernst Teunissen, our CFO. Last night, after market closed, we distributed and filed our Q2 2018 earnings release and we made available our prepared remarks on our Investor Relations website located at ir.tripadvisor.com.","In the release, you'll find reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures discussed on this call.

We're proud of how the business is doing. The Hotel meta business has turned around and we've got new media products that are gaining traction. On the Non-Hotel side, restaurants and attractions continue to grow and we're on track to hit our targets for the year. We're now forecasting adjusted EBITDA growth in both segments while still investing in our long-term core growth initiatives.","And with that, let's open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from Deepak Mathivanan of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Deepak Mathivanan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Two questions. First on Non-Hotel, margins came in lighter this quarter a little bit. You called out lapping of operating efficiency gains from last year. But maybe can you provide some additional color on areas that you're incrementally investing there? Is there any change in your view on the long-term margin profile of various business in this category?","And then second on Hotel, nice to see the healthy gains in mobile monetization continue, but it seems like desktop monetization also improved nicely in 2Q. Can you talk a bit about the drivers of desktop monetization? Is that sustainable? Or were there any sort of onetime gains this quarter? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Hey, Deepak. Good morning. This is Ernst. That's a lot of questions in one question, but we'll take them one at a time. So, first of all, Non-Hotel and I'll talk about the top-line as well as the bottom-line and I'll ask Steve to talk a little bit about our investment initiatives as well.","So, if you look at the Non-Hotel top-line we saw a deceleration from Q1 to Q2. There are always from quarter-to-quarter some lumpiness in year-over-year comparisons. If you look at the stack's two years growth for instance Q1 and Q2 were pretty much the same. We had a tough comp of growth in Q2. There's also always some timing of booking windows differences that cause the recognized revenues to fluctuate a little bit.","If you look at underlying bookings for instance in Non-Hotel, the deceleration between Q1 and Q2 was much less pronounced. So, we look at our Non-Hotel revenue path right now, it's pretty much where we expected it to be for the year and it feels pretty good internally. And we look at the rest of the year and are set to hit the growth targets that we have set out for that business, which is similar to last year.","So, we feel very good about the trajectory there and the headline print of deceleration of Q1 to Q2 is definitely not how it feels like underlying in the business. So that's on the top line. That flows somewhat through to the bottom line as well obviously. We look at margin, we saw a big margin expansion last year. We saw some efficiencies that we took last year, particularly on the marketing side less so this year. First-half margin up from last year's margin in Non-Hotel. There is potential for full-year margin to be higher, but we're also investing quite significantly in this business for long-term growth, which is not directly translated into quarter-to-quarter revenue acceleration but is really setting us up nicely for the long-term view. Steve, you want to talk a little bit about the investments we're making?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes. Thanks, Ernst. We have actually quite a few different tracks of investment in our Experiences business. Kind of say that this is going to be a great driver for us in the future, which in turn drives short-term investment, some of which you see pretty immediately in terms of things like 24-hour cancellation for most of the things that we sell, which is on the site live now, great for the consumer. Other things you see rollout over time better user experience, a lot of research being done there on both the TripAdvisor and the Viator points of sale.","You see some behind-the-scenes kind of channel growth as we get new partners and those benefits are seen a bit more over time. And then more than a handful of very much under the cover investments, mostly on the tech side that involve getting more supply, more accurate supply, more globalized supply, more internationalized, better language support, where in some cases we're bringing on supply in anticipation of demand. But it's always a bit of a chicken-and-egg thing there.","And then, we finally have our internationalization of our platform, moving the Viator tech base to be able to better support multiple languages, multiple points of sale. And so, the whole global expansion playbook that TripAdvisor executed very well on over the past decade plus a lot of that is still in front of us in terms of opportunity for Viator. You take that plus the Bokun acquisition, getting into the SaaS base, helping more and more suppliers get online. You see great growth or we think it's great growth in terms of online bookable supply. And we're still overall at the tip of the iceberg.","So, when we look at how this Attraction business, this Experiences business can compare to the trajectory of bringing hotel booking online 20 years ago we still see remarkable parallels similar margin structure. And it starts with collecting demand and supply, bringing it together and that's exactly what we're doing.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And so, shifting to the Hotel side with your second set of questions. So, we feel good about this trajectory of our Hotel business right now. And it's performing well in Q1 and Q2 and ahead of all of the expectations we had earlier in the year. And if you unpack that a little bit one of the important initiatives has been rationalizing our marketing portfolio and particularly weeding out some marketing spend that we felt was not as efficient as we thought before.","And that has resulted in some shopper headwind and we saw negative 3% shopper growth in the quarter, which is actually pretty good considering the magnitude of what we cut back to the benefit of EBITDA. There is a one-off impact this year and sets us up nicely for next year. So that's \u2013 we thought looked at the shopper growth and in light of the marketing efficiency that we took was actually a pretty good result and setting us up well for the future.","And then on the revenue per shopper side, yeah, we saw improvement there. So, the lower drag on revenue per shopper year-over-year than we saw in Q1 and in Q4. That was a good result for us. And if you unpack that a little bit it was between desktop \u2013 desktop was more or less flat year-over-year on revenue per shopper; mobile up.","And so, the fact that the aggregate was down is continued mix shift, but both actually performed strong in light of the fact that we still haven't lapped the partner bid downs of last year. And so, the fact that, for instance, desktop was flat, it shows you that the underlying performance of the shoppers is improving.","The quality of the shoppers is improving. Our monetization of those shoppers in terms of bookings generated for our partners is improving and that statistic is very encouraging to us and bodes well for the back half of the year where we see some easing of the year-over-year comparison on partner bidding levels.","Deepak Mathivanan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Ernst. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Wanted to kind of follow-up on some of the stuff, Ernst, you were talking about, getting more efficiency in direct marketing out of the Hotel segment. It doesn't seem like it's having much of an impact on revenues.","So, wondering if you can just give us a sense for maybe where you're finding those efficiencies? Are there areas you're still growing marketing spend where there are more efficiencies?","And then, kind of related to that how much of the direct spend is related to Non-Hotel with an eye towards understanding kind of how much room is left to keep cutting.","And then a second one just the deferred merchant payables growth slowed a bit. So, can you give us some color on how much of that is kind of Hotel Instant Book versus Vacation Rental versus Attractions and how that may show up in revenue in the second half, and where it may show up? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. Good morning, Lloyd. Yeah, we don't break down our direct marketing spend between segments. But to give you some color one of the statistics that you could read in the prepared remarks is that our total consolidated TAMG direct selling and marketing spend was negative 10% year-over-year.","And if you unpack that we're growing our TV expenditure in Hotel which is there. We're also growing our expenditure in our Non-Hotel business. So, the negative is all in-spite of those growth areas is driven by further rationalization in our online paid marketing in Hotel. That's the driver of this. And so logically that percentage year-over-year was down more than 10%.","And we've talked about this before. The source of this is an incremental over the last sort of 12 to 18 months incremental insight into our downstream booking behavior of the traffic that we buy and particularly honing our internal evaluation models and buying models of external traffic to be consistent with the downstream conversion.","And so that's opened up much better insight into what investments we were making in the past were profitable and which were less profitable. And it's that reorientation and it's that realignment that is driving the profitability.","We have \u2013 in our internal models for the year we assumed a certain shopper loss associated with that and revenue loss associated with that. We're finding that the team is able to adjust their marketing campaigns in a way that doesn't make us lose as much revenue as we initially thought given the size of the expenditure reduction. So that feels very good to us.","There is \u2013 we've done quite a bit of it \u2013 the team is still identifying further opportunities. So, in terms of which inning are you in in finding these efficiencies, we're well into the seventh inning I would say. Of course, that benefits us every quarter in a year-over-year basis, but there is some more efficiency that we think we can find. But that's the eighth and ninth inning rather than as large as what we had done before.","On deferred merchant payables and the workings there, as I was saying also on the revenue side, there are sort of shifts in booking windows and then you see an aggregate of impacts from Rentals as well as from our Experiences business. The trends are pretty much as we would expect them to be given our bookings growth and there are some timing differences from quarter-to-quarter. But you see like this quarter like you have seen in other years, significant cash inflow on deferred merchant payables, which is going to flow out again in the back half of the year. And those trends are pretty much in line where we expect them to be.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey, good morning. Couple of questions, if I could. Within Non-Hotel, would you be able to provide a broad strokes breakdown between Experiences and Restaurants? I'm guessing you don't want to give precise percentages, but any high-level mix you can share on that?","And then second, what are you seeing from a competitive standpoint in Tours and Attractions? It seems like this should be fairly unique inventory, but are you seeing any others coming in that are kind of building up much of that disaggregated Experiences inventory? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thanks, Mike. I'll take the first part of this and Steve will take the second part. We don't \u2013 on a quarterly basis \u2013 we don't break out our revenue between the different lines in Non-Hotel, but we did say at the end of last year that for 2017 the breakdown was roughly 50% of revenue in Experiences and then equally 25% in Restaurants and in Rentals. Obviously, that is shifting this year. The growth rate in Restaurants and Attractions is significantly ahead of Rentals. So that's going to be different for this year and we'll provide you with an updated view on the mix at some point in the future.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And to your question on inventory \u2013 Tours and Attractions inventory, there's certainly several other players that have \u2013 and in some cases, they're still trying to gather the industry footprint, no one particularly close to us at this point. But to be clear, the inventory we have is not exclusive and we don't see that that would be a key trend or an expectation going forward. There's so much that is already out there. Getting more of it to be bookable on our sites is the clearer opportunity versus having to fight for market share from any of the other players.","TripAdvisor sits in a pretty darn unique position in the industry by having such an impressive demand footprint of people looking for things to do. A lot of our brand is built around having that great vacation \u2013 people already coming to TripAdvisor for that \u2013 and we have the in-destination footprint. So when you wake up in your hotel room and you're looking for what you're going to that day or the next, we're still the natural site to go to.","So while of course, we do pay attention to the competitive players that are there in the space, we're much more focused on growing the pie and helping the consumers who are on TripAdvisor and Viator and the ones that we can attract with the best inventory, the best customer experience, the best customer service to make their stays delightful. And if we keep our eye on that ball, I think we're in great shape for a long time.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Patterson from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. I'll go back to the marketing theme. As you've learned more about downstream booking behavior and go into the seventh inning of these marketing efficiencies, what are the factors you're looking at as you think about reinvesting in TV or performance marketing? It seems like some of the benefits you've seen so far this year beyond just channel efficiencies, but also competitors moderating some of their spend.","But longer term, I'd argue that you need to start seeing site traffic growing again to really drive sustainable growth in both the Hotel and the Non-Hotel business. So, any color you can provide on what you're thinking about for factor-wise to reinvest in marketing would be helpful? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. Well, you've certainly seen \u2013 let me, thanks Justin, it's an excellent question \u2013 you've certainly seen our shift over time from some of the performance-based channels to the more branded channels like television. And it's great to see those working for us. We already have such a global brand \u2013 that to our chagrin was slightly misunderstood in some cases in terms of not being understood as a place that you could go to compare prices.","Our TV campaign is successively moving that perception over to more of what we want, which is the reviews, the great experience and the ability to compare the price and find the best deal. And that's what's driving some of our revenue per shopper improvements. That's what's driving some of our overall value from the traffic we already have.","Of course, we would love to see more hotel shopper growth. But I urge you to remember, we already have a phenomenal amount of hotel shoppers. And so, having these folks do a bit more what we would like them to do in terms of being closer to the transaction, come back a few more times during their trip and you could paint \u2013 and we do internally paint a wonderful picture \u2013 that doesn't require us to buy a lot more new traffic through these other channels.","TripAdvisor's a great site to be a member of. TripAdvisor's going to help you plan your whole trip. If we can tap into those touch points a few more times for each visit we get that just drops straight to the bottom line for either Hotels or Experiences or Restaurants for us because we offer so many services across the trip.","And of course, a lot of it starts with the hotel shopper. But there isn't \u2013 we don't feel a need to get to double-digit growth in hotel shopper in order to drive business forward. We're fortunate to play in such a big category that there is that opportunity for double-digit. But again, we don't need to feel it because our opportunity to improve the overall revenue per shopper for all those shoppers that we have is still there.","Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you, Steve.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Certainly.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. I think I'll just stick with that hotel shopper line of questions. And just to put it all in context, I just wanted to go back and check. This is the first quarter in which hotel shoppers have declined for you year-over-year and I get the point that that's in part due to marketing efficiency measures on your part, but do you want to set some expectations as to what you think what you'd like to have that hotel shopper growth be like in the future even if it's not double digits? Can you return it to growth?","And just address the issue of is it purely the decelerating or declining year-over-year because of your marketing efficiencies? Or could there be something else going on? Could there be a shift towards other hotel shopping channels just throughout Google? Or anything else? I would think long-term you wouldn't want year-over-year decline in hotel shoppers even you if you get an improvement in revenue per shopper. So just spend a little bit more time talking about how we should expect that metric to look in the future and why you wouldn't want it to grow reasonably strongly going forwards.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify. We don't want it to decline. We think we have all the reasons in the world to have it continue to grow, doesn't need to get back up to double-digit growth for us to be successful. No, it really doesn't, and we're just dealing with lots of very large numbers here.","When we look at the decline in this particular quarter, and perhaps for the next quarter, so as we lap year-on-year, we do point very specifically to our paid marketing channels as having \u2013 since we're cutting back on those that's having an effect on our hotel shopper growth.","I'll note that we're obviously \u2013 and you can see it in the numbers, cutting back we think in a pretty smart way as in we're cutting back on the least profitable of these hotel shoppers for us. So yes, the overall number may have declined, but it's the ones that we're doing the least on our side.","We have a bunch of other things both in development and just as part of our overall TV strategy that counteracts the decline in hotel shoppers. And we expect it to continue to grow and I just don't want to set the expectation that we need the double-digit growth that we saw in years past in order to successfully grow in the Hotel category and grow overall.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Please go ahead.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Maybe two-part question with respect to the Non-Hotel business. Is there any color you can give us on how much traffic or how much interaction there is between TripAdvisor in terms of feeding traffic into the Non-Hotel properties, just so we can get a better sense of how synergies might be able to be achieved between the various brands under the TripAdvisor corporate sort of umbrella?","And then second, talk a little bit about marketing on the Non-Hotel side, where do you find that you're getting efficiency in terms of driving traffic, new users, brand awareness, just so we get a little bit better sense on how that margin structure might evolve over time. Thanks so much.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. We might tag team this a bit. This is Steve. On the Non-Hotel side, in general the traffic \u2013 if I understand the question correctly, the traffic that's coming to the TripAdvisor's point-of-sale and interacting in the restaurant and hotel, I mean restaurant and attraction category, in general are staying on the restaurant and hotel \u2013 restaurant and attraction pages on Trip. You can book almost all if not all of the attractions while staying on Trip. You don't need to be sent over to the Viator point-of-sale. And on restaurants, again, you can make most of the reservations throughout for \u2013 while staying on TripAdvisor and our entire Restaurant Media business is entirely on TripAdvisor.","So that TripAdvisor as the channel to sell and promote attractions is the fastest growing. It's been that way for quite some time and it's our lead horse from a global perspective. It's not the only point-of-sale obviously, but the one we're putting most of the muscle behind.","To the kind of marketing on the Non-Hotel side, obviously we try to employ many if not all of the same paid performance channels. And as I was talking about TV earlier, right now the message has been focused on educating folks. They can do price comparison, hotel shopping on TripAdvisor not just reviews, but it's likely going forward that we're going to step into the fact that our entire value proposition is all around everything you can do to have a fantastic trip. Hotel is part of it. Restaurant is part of it. Experience is part of it and so I'd say it's likely our advertising campaign or TV campaign also expands to cover not just hotel price comparison but more.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May from Citi. Please go ahead. Mr. May, your line is open.","Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes, thank you. Sorry about that. I apologize if this has been covered already, but could you comment on the click-based RPS improvement and how much of that sequentially is due to maybe just a pick-up, auction dynamics and a pickup in demand from advertisers from somewhat depressed levels in the second half of last year versus the result of maybe improvement in conversion rate? Thank you.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Hey Mark, this is Ernst. The overall sort of bidding environment has been pretty stable in Q1 and Q2 from those levels of Q4. Obviously, down year-over-year from levels we saw before those bid downs happened last year. But pretty stable environment. So, the improvement \u2013 the relative improvement, we believe is more a function of improvements we're making to with the quality of the traffic and the experience on the site.","Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And sorry if this has been covered already, but in terms of Non-Hotel revenue growth and the slowdown in the growth rate itself year-on-year how much of that is driven just by long large numbers? Or are there \u2013 one of your contributors to that line that you saw a slowdown that's kind of masking other dynamics in that segment?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah. I did talk about that earlier on the call. What I would say is it is the quarterly inconsistencies of how revenue comes in. And so, if you look at that two-year stack basis Q1 and Q2 was very similar in growth. We had a difficult comp in Q2 last year.","If you look at underlying bookings growth quarter-to-quarter much less pronounced difference Q1 to Q2.","And so, some of this is the timing window of the revenue recognition as well. So, we're looking at Q1 and Q2 and we see pretty consistent performance of our Non-Hotel business and we look at the rest of the year and our expectations are intact.","Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Ernst.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Brooks from Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Matthew Brooks - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning, guys. I want to get into that sort of Non-Hotel segment again. Maybe can you talk a little bit about the maturity profile when you add new listings to Viator? You basically doubled the listings in the last year. But does it take quarters? Or does it take years of those bookings per listing to start to mature?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","This is Steve, great question, thank you, Matthew. It's all \u2013 some of that is a bit new to us for the types of inventory that we're growing. And again, inventory is just one metric. It's a necessity if you're looking to grow globally.","But as we bring on smaller tours and attractions and less travel parts of the world as that's what happens in marketplace they're not going to be performing to the speed, to the scope of your big top-tier attractions in major tourist destinations, which for the most part we already have.","So, as we go forward we thought it was helpful to show that we were investing a lot in supply acquisition on a very global basis which we are. And a lot of those attractions will become the tour performers for us over time.","Some of it is just make sure it's working properly on the system. Other parts is us actually building more of the demand footprint in that particular part of the world as well.","So again, it'll take time I would say, I had a few more specifics for you to your question, but we're comfortable that we're certainly on the right path there.","Matthew Brooks - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. And I guess, as a follow-up on the sponsored ads, is there any sort of dial you can point to, to highlight the attraction you're seeing there in either restaurants or hotels?","And are you looking at this product as something you want to use in experiences as well?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah. So, we think it's kind of a great product that matches the fact that a lot of our hotel shoppers are high in the funnel and it's an opportunity for hoteliers to get themselves in the consideration set, right?","You can only have 10 or 20 properties in the first page on a New York or Paris. But you have a lot of other terrific properties that really are great for consumers that are on page three or four in that shortlist and here's the opportunity for them to be considered so wide appeal amongst hoteliers.","Similarly, in restaurants we have four plus million restaurants on the site and if you're already kind of number one in your city it may not be the right product for you. But that leaves 3.9 plus million for whom this is a good opportunity for exposure to our couple hundred million monthly eyeballs for restaurants for instance.","So, would we roll it out to experiences? Sure. Under consideration, again, experiences is much more of a transaction model for us. So, it's not as timely if you will. But to back it up the offering the sponsor placements for restaurants and hotels as a great media product we see a ton of headroom going forward. And it's off to a very nice start.","Matthew Brooks - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. First, just wanted to ask you about mobile revenue per mobile hotel shopper. Obviously, you saw some strength there. Just probably if you could just quantify a little bit of what you're seeing in terms of the gap relative to desktop?","And then just secondly, just given the time that you've spent in travel landscapes, Steve and obviously, how well you know the other players, how are you thinking about the sustainability of these kind of stable auction dynamics going forward given that we've seen kind of different periods in time over the years different behavior? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","This is Ernst. I'll start with the first part on the RPS and let, Steve, talk after. In terms of mobile RPS, yes, we're seeing continued improvement of mobile RPS and it was up again double digit this quarter year-over-year. And so, we're very pleased with that. We're showing growth even while we're lapping some of the impressive improvements that we made last year. And so that is good.","The monetization gap quarter-to-quarter didn't move very much. We're still at this approximately 40% monetization on mobile versus desktop. We also saw nice improvements on desktop. So, at the end of the day the overall improvement is what really matters, but we're pleased with that mobile RPS and we see more headroom there of improvements.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And this is Steve. On the stable auction dynamics, as Ernst mentioned, we've seen stability. We feel we have very strong relationships with all of our big clients, all of our small clients as well. And we have a robust auction. There is the caveat that our partners at any point could make changes to what their bidding strategies are. But the scale at which we operate and the position in the funnel of which most of our, or many of our customers are at, makes us a pretty unique traffic source for the major OTAs and the hotel brands, simply because we're at the, I'm not sure where I want to go yet, I'm not sure where I want to stay and that's a very up-funnel demand that is often ahead of where the big OTAs are.","As such, it's traffic that's up for grabs. It's traffic that enable our clients can try to make loyal to their booking engine and we're comfortable with that because of our up-funnel position, because of the fact that so many are loyal to TripAdvisor as the place to start their travel planning experience and our overall value proposition is really quite different than, obviously, a hotel brand or a straight OTA.","As everyone is looking to have travelers pick their site as \u2013 or their app as the place to start \u2013 we're comfortable with where we are in the ecosystem because of our hotel, and restaurants, and attractions, and flights, and guides, and experiences and community as a way to differentiate from the other choices that travelers have. And our continued 10%, I believe it was 10% this past quarter, year-over-year growth, shows that yeah, even at the large numbers we have we're still attracting more and more travelers each quarter.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And just to follow-up there. If you saw the environment heat up again at some point in time, I mean there would obviously be some benefits to you, but at the same time I imagine you'd have to respond in terms of how you're spending your marketing dollars ultimately. Is that something that you're kind of prepared to do if things were to change?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","I mean, we look at our different revenue streams and say, we're investing in our media businesses because there is a ton that we feel we can offer to hoteliers and restaurateurs and eventually attraction suppliers all around the globe that isn't dependent upon auction, but is dependent on the fact that we have 400-plus million new views a month. It's just the eyeballs that are on our site that don't go away, don't change depending on whether the auction is paying top dollar or lower dollar. So again, if we get paid more, then yes, by our return on investment marketing philosophy we can spend more. And if we get paid less, we choose to spend less as well. But again, we've been used to those dynamics for quite some time.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Thomas White from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Thomas White - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Was just hoping maybe you could give a bit more color on the early ramp of the premium media product for hotels, number of advertisers maybe, typical length of commitments, typical spend, anything like that?","And then just on the auction you talked about stability. I was just hoping you could maybe characterize that a bit. Is it still that the large advertisers have kind of higher ROI targets across the board that haven't changed? Or are you seeing signs that particular markets or geographies, some of these guys are maybe being a little bit more aggressive or selectively more aggressive to kind of lean into the channel again? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. So we're not at the point where we're able to disclose much by way of the media products for hotels or restaurants, but I do enjoy being able to add the color that both are launched, are global. We're seeing meaningful product improvements in both categories on a quarterly basis. We continue to see sales grow. And since there's both the subscription elements as well as the pay-per-click elements, when we look at the growth of this category of product for us, the media as opposed to auction, it continues to show kind of really nice promise with none of the potential threats of changing ROI behavior of our OTA clients.","So, it's just a nice kind of diversification, tapping into our overall traffic. Both hotel and restaurants for sponsor placement, the pay-per-click, are self-service and we have, depending on the product, different levels of sales assist and business development activities going on against them.","Obviously, once a client joins on the sponsored placement, it's very much on a performance basis. We only charge when the click happens and it's their opportunity to get into the discovery set. And that's what so many of these clients have been asking for, for so many years because there isn't any other way to \u2013 I mean, you still can't influence our overall ranking \u2013 that's based purely on our best value algorithm, but sponsor placements, lets you get visibility onto that page. And then -","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah. In terms of the auction stability and any trends to call out, no trends really to call out. We've said we've seen stability since the mid-Q4 into Q1, Q2. There's always little fluctuations around everything based on geo, et cetera, but nothing to call out really here. Overall, stability is what we like to emphasize.","Thomas White - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just in terms of on your prepared remarks in terms of the guidance, you said you were incrementally more confident for this year. I guess, does that mean you're incrementally more confident versus 1Q? And can you sort of unpack what you meant by that a little bit?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes. Thanks for the question Jed. Yes, we did say in the prepared remarks incrementally confident about our EBITDA growth. Look, we've had a good first half of the year. It exceeded our expectations that we had at the beginning of the year. Q2 exceeded our expectations that we had at the beginning of Q2, and so we are looking at the rest of the year. And compared to where we were three months ago, again, we have readjusted our expectations and have upped our own expectations internally.","And so, when we look at that and we feel pretty good. We'd say, we expect incremental growth. It's not what we expected in the beginning of the year. We did 9% year-over-year growth in the first half of the year on EBITDA. We've commented before that we see some of these trends that we have easing in the back half. We said before that we expect sort of relative year-over-year performance of EBITDA to be back-end weighted. We still believe that. And so, if you look at a start-off of the quarter, this quarter, July was strong, was solid. And so, things are looking really good for us from here and that was behind our statement that we're incrementally confident.","Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","And then just back on the marketing, can you give us a sense how much of your non-television marketing is actually being utilized to drive mobile shoppers to your apps and sites?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","This is Steve. I mean, of course, all of our performance channels work on mobile. And if you're buying traffic on a Google and you have our app installed, you're going to automatically be deep-linked, so that'll end up in the app.","If the question is, are we spending a ton of money on buying app installs? That's not currently part of our game plan. We have a lot of app installs because we have a great app that people want to use when they're traveling. And we rely more on that. Did that address your question? Or was...","Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Yeah. That's yeah. Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. I have a question on TV ads. How far along are you as far as the global rollout? And do you see yourself bringing those TV ads to all of your key markets? And what timeframe? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Well, we certainly are in the majority of our key markets already. We're \u2013 as every quarter passes we're more and more excited and pleased with what TV's been able to do for our brand and our revenue. The decision to increase our spend on TV, the decision to restart last year and increase our spend this year were clearly the right ones. And I think our financials show that and we're educating and building the brand.","And I alluded to earlier the fact that, while the TV campaign maybe just about hotel price comparison at the moment it would be reasonable to expect that to extend to more of our community more of our full-value proposition that we can offer to travelers including some of our newer businesses. So, we don't disclose certainly this far in advance whether we will be adding TV in additional key markets, but we I can comfortably say we view this as a great channel for us that we're happy that we got into.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, Steve.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thanks","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Erickson from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Brad Erickson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Just a follow-up. I guess two follow-ups. When you look at the hotel shoppers on the site you're seeing today what portion of those would you say are coming to the site directly? And I guess how has that changed over the past year?","And then secondarily, related to your comments you made earlier it just seemed to imply that hotel shopper growth wasn't necessarily the most important thing necessary to grow overall. Is the intent there really just to monetize better on the most profitable part of your traffic? Just would like to understand what was meant by that a bit better. Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah, I'd urge folks not to focus too much on that hotel shopper growth comment earlier simply because I've said it multiple times in the past in terms of we have so many hotel shoppers. Getting them to stick around and return on their own accord within the same trip, just if you do the math is a bigger opportunity than potentially attracting more. We love big numbers, it says it will continue to be hard to grow that at meaningful double digits. So, I didn't want to set expectations that we needed that to happen to grow the biz.","Our opportunity to take the traffic the hotel shoppers and other shoppers that are on our site that really are pretty far away from a transaction and to pull them by talking to them with a better site experience, more functionality and pull them down the shopping path, so that when they are ready to in fact select a specific hotel to select a specific booking site that we're the site that they return to do that. That's a couple of hundred million hotel shoppers a month. That remains our fundamental biggest opportunity which was a completely true statement a year ago, and frankly two years ago as well.","We do hope to have hotel shopper numbers return to growth in subsequent years. Of course, because the overall market of hotel shopper still has plenty of headroom for us.","And to the first part of your question hotel shoppers coming to main \u2013 direct \u2013 we don't split out that quite yet but you can certainly understand that we do care about that as a metric or sort of homepage, first page view and TV of course, helps drive some of that as well as obviously, the better site experience and the communication that we're able to do with the customers to pull them back. All of which, it's sort of direct traffic as opposed to paid for or accidental traffic.","Brad Erickson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. That's helpful color. Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. A couple of quick ones. In your letter you talked about the rental, the Non-Hotel rental business you got and some competitive pressure there. Can you give us a view on how you look at that strategically as you look out over the horizon? Is this an area where you're still investing significantly or investing at all in building supply? Could we expect some marketing support there in the future? Just kind of some color on how you look at that opportunity in the meta channel?","And then a quick one on the TV advertising, in terms of the increase in the quarter, possible to give us any color on whether that was the addition of additional markets or whether in some of your big markets with your adding weeks or weights given the fact that some of the OTA competitors are increasing their brand television spending as well? Thank you very much.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Peter, this is Ernst. I'll take the first part of your question. The Rentals business is a good business for us. It's an important business for us to be in for our users. It's part of our complete offering in accommodations to have a hotel offering as well as alternative accommodation offering. We operate a number of brands in the rentals business and importantly offered on our TripAdvisor brand, which gives us a lot of volume in this category.","And it's a nice business for us. It's profitable business for us. It is not a business where to your question, where we're incrementally putting a lot of investment dollars behind it compared to what we're doing in experiences and restaurants. And the most important reason is that we see a lot of blue sky and greenfields in the experiences space and we have an early head start. And so, we're making most of our push there same on the restaurant side.","On the rental side, it's a very competitive place and we're playing it a little slower. But as I said it's a profitable business for us and we're very happy to have the business.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And this is Steve. On the TV, at the beginning of the year we had launched a number of new markets, expanding and doing some additional creative as well. And we had set expectations that the spend would be north of $100 million this year, and so the Q2 increase is really just the follow through on that. It is to some degree a combination of new markets, but just being on air for we feel the proper seasonal weights. So kind of you shouldn't read anything into our spend being a reaction to what other folks are doing versus what we think is right to grow our brand.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And as a reminder last year we started the spend in June. So only in one month of the quarter last year and obviously, this year we were present on television in all three months of the quarter.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Naved Khan from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Naved Khan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks a lot. Just a couple \u2013 Steve or maybe Ernst you can answer this. How much headroom do you see to continue to drive improvement in mobile hotel shopper monetization? By my math, I guess, you saw that metric grow 12% last quarter versus maybe somewhere in the 20s% in the quarter before that. You probably anniversaried some of the changes from last year. How should we think about this going forward? And then I had a quick follow-up on the Non-Hotel side.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure, this is Steve. I certainly believe there's continued room for mobile monetization, improved mobile monetization. In part our mobile site just continues to get better. All of the improvements that we do all or almost all of them are rolled out mobile first. That's where our consumers are today. That's \u2013 they're still migrating there in larger numbers. So, there is kind of no doubt internally that that continues to be a focus. We also just benefit from the fact that consumers in general are more happy to buy things on the phone.","And so, as an up-funnel consumer comes to us clicks through to a partner, they're more likely to transact. That partner's more likely to give us credit for the transaction because we sent them the lead. So, the CPCs go up. So some of it, we certainly believe is the great work that the team here is doing. And there's just other secular tailwinds that we expect will improve our mobile monetization over time in all markets. There is kind of no question in our mind.","Naved Khan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Do you opine on which inning we are in? Is it middle innings or early innings?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","I think it's probably still early innings, in part just because consumer behavior, travel's still a big purchase and \u2013 why is it our desktop CPCs are so much better than mobile CPCs \u2013 people wanting to stay somewhere. And our best answer is that people are still more comfortable with that type of purchase on their bigger screen, bigger device.","And so, I'm not sure they'll ever be equal. But as more \u2013 as everyone does more and more stuff on the phone, we're in a perfectly good position to benefit from that. We're in a better position than many others to benefit from it, in part because it's been such a headwind for us in the past, and as consumers get used to buying it moves to being more of a tailwind given so much of our traffic \u2013 over half \u2013 is already on the phone.","Naved Khan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And just on the Non-Hotel side how \u2013 what were the contribution from Bokun? Can you quantify it? And how important is performance advertising for the growth in the channel?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","So, the financial impact of Bokun was very limited in the second quarter, other than the investment that we made. We are going to make incremental investments throughout the year to drive the strategy behind Bokun. Bokun doesn't add a lot of revenue, but a lot of capability \u2013 a lot of revenue right now \u2013 but a great capability that we're going to invest behind, which is ultimately going to help us in the business. So, not a big impact just yet in our financials.","Naved Khan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then the performance or the importance of performance advertising to the growth of Non-Hotel?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes. So, performance-based marketing as a percent of revenue is the highest in our experiences business. It's for instance much lower on our restaurant business. So it's mixed. The intensity on the P&L is mixed. But particularly for our experience business, performance-based marketing is an important channel that we continue to lever.","Naved Khan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from James Lee from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","James Lee - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is about the ROI requirement for marketing spend. And in the past you said onetime for digital. It seems like over the last few quarters you performed better than expectation. Is that correct to say?","And also in the past you said that if you performed better than onetime digital, you'd actually use the excess to invest in 2019. That doesn't seem like the case given your commentary on hotel shopper growth. I just want to confirm that? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes. So we have turned our performance-based marketing channels more towards profitability as opposed to great breakeven, with the profitability measured on a more accurate system that looks at the downstream booking revenue as opposed to just what we can measure instantly, the click base. It's a little complicated but it's a better reflection of how valuable the traffic is that we're sending to our clients.","And we've certainly used some of the savings in our performance channels to help fund some of the brand building, the TV stuff that we're doing, and that's part of where that mix shift is headed. I don't believe we've said that we would be taking savings from performance-based marketing channels and doing anything specific with them next year.","James Lee - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Okay. And can I ask a follow-up question, Steve? You sounded very confident on your hotel \u2013 revenue per hotel shopper growth going forward \u2013 and help us understand how should we expect the growth for 2019, number one? And what you're doing specifically to drive better conversions there? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","So, we have multiple years history of driving improved revenue per shopper per device on desktop and on the phone. The mix shift moving to the phone can make that overall number decline in spite of the kind of continued optimization on each device. What hit us was back half of last year with just the drop in the CPCs, which of course impacts revenue per shopper. So, I can't commit to improved revenue per shopper simply because I don't control what our big partners did. We've always faced that issue and all I can represent at this point is that given the public commentary of our bigger clients, given the dynamics as we see them in the meta space and given the past two quarters, the auction looks stable at this point. We're providing very real value, a better ROI for our clients, and we have no reason to think that that's going to be changing, certainly not in the near term.","With that as an admitted assumption, then the improvements that we've been making to the product, both desktop and mobile web and app, we just \u2013 we have a nice history of improving the revenue per shopper if everything else is constant. It's better pricing on the site. It's better supply. It's a better sort. It's the UX improvements, the preference improvements. I mean, sizable teams working against this every single day with a nice track record saying, yeah, and we make improvements when all other things are constant.","So again, history is the best indicator there. And aside from any external bidding changes I think we have the track record that accept that statement or that backs up my comments I should say.","Operator","Thank you. I show no further questions in queue. This concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to CEO Steve Kaufer. Please go ahead.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Well, great. Hey! thanks everyone for joining the call. We had a strong first half of 2018. And I really want to thank all the TripAdvisor employees who put in a ton of hard work to get us here. It's great to see the business making this rebound at this point.","We've done a bunch of changes strengthened the business in a whole bunch of different fronts. We're proud of our Hotel segment, proud of the Non-Hotel and looking forward to an improved back half of the year as we shared and sets us on a nice trajectory for 2019.","So, thanks everyone. And we will update you again next quarter.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for attending today's conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Will Lyons, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please begin.","Will Lyons - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thanks, LaToya. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Steve Kaufer, our CEO; and Ernst Teunissen, our CFO.","Last night after market closed we distributed and filed our Q1 earnings release as well as made available our prepared remarks on our Investor Relations website located at ir.tripadvisor.com.

Thank you for joining the call. The first quarter 2016 was pivotal for TripAdvisor as we continued to rapidly build the best end-to-end user experience in travel.","First, some comments on our Hotel segment. We're excited to be mostly complete with our instant booking rollout. Phase 1 was getting hotelier and OTA partner adoption in 2015. Phase 2 was executing the global product launch, and we are now in Phase 3, which is perfecting the booking experience and educating users about their ability to book on TripAdvisor.","And finally, Phase 4 is all about delighting more users, achieving higher conversion rates, driving direct business and repeat behavior and plugging the monetization leak. We're pleased with our continued progress, although we recognize there's still a lot of work ahead of us.","In our Non-Hotel segment, these businesses are performing well. They're aimed at big market opportunities and are tailor-made for mobile devices. We're hard at work in improving our products, creating the best end-to-end user experience at all stages of travel planning and trip taking. We're focused on doing what's in the best interest of our business for the long term.","Ernst?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thank you, Steve. Our first quarter results were in line with our internal forecasts, and I want to reiterate that our growth outlook and margin commentary for the full year remains intact.","In our Hotel segment, we saw significant revenue growth deceleration due to our global instant booking launch, with a corresponding impact on EBITDA. Both were expected and communicated in February.","In our Non-Hotel segment, revenue growth was masked this quarter as we shift towards a transactional model in vacation rentals, which results in a substantial portion of bookings made in Q1 being recognized as revenue when the stay happens later in the year. This increased seasonality of Non-Hotel is another driver we communicated in February.","As we have discussed, 2016 is an important transition year. We're executing on our long-term strategy and in the near-term, we expect decelerating growth in the first half and improving growth rates in the back half.","With that, we'll now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And the first question is from Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question, if I can ask two. In the prepared remarks, you seem to suggest the instant book monetization is continuing to improve in the U.S. and ahead of the rest of the world. Is there any color you can share, digging into the unit economics of what, say, a click on instant book monetizes that, relative to a click in metasearch in the U.S., and kind of what the growth \u2013 the slope of that curve looks like? Obviously, growth rates mathematically improve in the second half as you comp through that rollout, but can it be a growth driver beyond lapping instant \u2013 easy compares?","And then, second question would just be on leakage. Obviously, it's a big objective here. And last quarter you talked about repeat rates rising, which would be natural with a new product, but when you look at kind of the aggregate percent of hotel shoppers that are clicking on a monetization unit broadly, be it meta or IB, is that percentage rising meaningfully, perhaps, in your more mature markets? That's it. Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thank you, Lloyd. Indeed, in the U.S. we have seen, since the launch in the U.S., improvement that we've been able to make in the monetization of instant booking. And the most important lever for us has been to work on the supply, both in terms of the number of hotels available in instant booking, as well as on the content that we provide for those hotels. So, we've been working hard on that throughout the year and we saw \u2013 we've continued to see improvements in our ability to improve that monetization in the United States.","In the rest of the world, where we have just rolled out in the first quarter; not surprisingly, we see that that monetization is less good than it is in the U.S. today, and like it was in the U.S. early days. So we're seeing that we have a larger gap outside of the U.S. between meta and IB than we have in the U.S., and that's to be expected. And when you just roll out, you have a few teething problems that we're working hard on to improve, and expect to improve over the year.","In terms of some of the underlying repeat metrics, so we've seen in the U.S., because that's where the data is most relevant, because we have a longer series here, we see month-on-month and quarter-on-quarter, we see improvements in repeat rates. Not just what percentage of bookings is repeated, as you said in your opening, but also the percentage of first-time bookers that come back in any period of time, that percentage is improving quarter-on-quarter, month-on-month.","What we also see is that bookers that do come back then tend to convert better. We also see that bookers that come back tend to convert better than meta-clickers that come back and click again. And so, we see a couple of very important trends here that we believe are indications that the thesis is at least starting to work in the U.S. Now, as I said before, outside of the U.S., it's very early days, and we have that path to climb in the rest of the year.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is open.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to talk a little bit about the revenue per hotel shopper trends. You called out three drivers there, dilution from IB, mobile mix and the revenue recognition issue. Can we size what the impact of those three were on revenue per hotel shopper in the quarter, and how we should be thinking about those three inputs sort of trajecting (8:01) as we move through the year? Thanks so much.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","The largest driver of it is instant booking, that's the most significant driver here. And if you unpack instant booking, in fact, the largest driver there is just that monetization difference that I described just before. And then there's a secondary impact, which is the revenue recognition component of it as well. So, instant booking as a whole is the most important driver. Then, sort of the mix between desktop and phone and how we comped last year is a secondary, much smaller impact. And then lastly, there's also a bit of currency, 1% to 2% of currency as well, which negatively impacted, but instant booking is by far the largest driver.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is for Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks. Good morning. In the prepared remarks, you described your four-phase rollout for instant book, and now you're on Phase 3, which is helping more users book on Trip and optimizing that experience. What does that entail? Is it making tweaks to the interface? Or is it marketing to essentially convince people that booking on Trip is what they can be doing now versus just window shopping?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Hi. This is Steve. Thanks Mike for the question. So, there's actually quite a few components and it's great to finally have the product rolled out almost everywhere because that's a lot of heavy lifting that takes a bunch of resources. But it is now about making sure everyone in all of our markets understand that you can book on TripAdvisor, and we started this approach over a year ago on desktop U.S. and we found it's taken a while to get that repeat rate up. But we've seen that kind of steadily climb. And that's the signs that we're looking for, and we're now on day one or day 30 for a bunch of our other international markets.","So, as that grows and now we can kind of count on it growing globally, it's fundamentally taking the audience that's on TripAdvisor, helping them, guiding them, where appropriate, down the instant book path. We see that when they do go down the instant book path they tend to come back more frequently than if they went down a meta-path, but we're very cognizant that pricing is a critical factor, and where the instant book price isn't the best, we have meta-available everywhere. And as I've said before, and for the avoidance of doubt, we expect our meta-business to continue to be strong in that kind of forever timeframe.","We want folks to, travelers to be able to come to TripAdvisor, find the best price. If instant booking has that great price and the great experience, that's going to be were that initial booker is going to book. And as we have the credit card stored, it's going to be where the repeat booker might well prefer to transact out of ease-of-use, out of the simplicity, out of offering a great price and a past great experience.","That takes a while. In terms of the actual interface of instant booking and what we can do on the site, and how we can do more promotions to help drive awareness of the fact that you can book on TripAdvisor, I think you see a lot of change on the site on a frequent basis and you see a number of different marketing programs that we've launched on the site in many countries. We have a sweepstakes running, we have a Viator attraction coupon running right now, just lots of different ways to subtly, and frankly not so subtly, remind people\/let people know that Trip is a great place to complete your booking.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Ken Sena of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Ken Sena - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Just on the comments about the U.S. rollout and the fact that you have a smaller than average dilution you're seeing from IB. You also make the comment though that on mobile you're seeing the improvement there, and it does seem that it's actually accretive on a revenue per hotel shopper basis. Anything else you could say maybe that might help us think through the trade-off there, or any points of inflection maybe as far as the time spent or anything else that might help us model this phasing over the course of this year? Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Well actually, I'm glad you brought up the mobile because that happens to be a piece we're particularly proud of this year. There's no question that as our traffic shifts from the traditional desktop platform to the phone, we've been facing a monetization headwind, because the phone had just monetized. I remind folks that was one of the reasons we launched instant book a while ago, because we saw this coming, we want to make sure we're the best platform to be able to plan and book your trip. And so, as you look at the phone, we're in the U.S. certainly fully rolled out with instant booking, we're building that repeat usage, we're vaulting the cards, we're getting more and more repeat booking. So our revenue per hotel shopper, not only is our hotel shopper growing nicely on the phone, but the revenue per hotel shopper had that very nice lift in Q1.","What really changed? Well, it wasn't IB rollout per se because we were already rolled out on the phone. It was some combination of the better experience, better pricing, better content, all the things that we work on from a supply perspective, better optimization of the user experience, so all the good work that the UI team has been doing, and the fact that folks are comfortable booking on the phone on TripAdvisor because they've experienced it in the past. So, that was a nice 20% plus lift. And as we look forward, and as we start to see that in some other markets, we're excited about closing the gap on phone to desktop, as we know phone is a huge percentage of where our business will be.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Perry Gold of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Two please if I may. Can you provide an update on how conversion rates at instant book now compare with meta-search in the U.S.? And also I was wondering if you could help us to better understand on the tenor of conversations with mid-size chain and independent hotel partners has changed with the launch of instant book? Do they now feel greater comfort with this model versus meta-search, where they may have felt a little intimidated bidding against the major OTAs and where they likely perceive the higher risk profile? Thanks so much.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes, thanks, Perry. The conversion rates, meta versus IB in the U.S., a quarter ago we said they were comparable. There are many puts and takes throughout the quarter, also dependent on what happens to meta itself, but I think as a broad statement that is true. IB conversion rates are, in the U.S., also still lower, but as we say, comparable, it means that they're at least closer and approaching compared to outside of the U.S. And I'll give it to, you, Steve, for the hotel partners.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And we're really quite pleased with our hotel partnership. I don't detect much concern left, frankly, in most parts of the world regarding mid-size folks or even large folks coming on to instant book. That logjam, if you will, was broken last year and we have, frankly, more hotels interested in popping on IB now than we can kind of get through our system, if you will. So, from a supply perspective, that's the plan. We want to connect with every hotel that's on our site so that it can be instantly bookable. We'll get there. We have more and more chains coming online. We have more and more independents coming online, but with our OTA partners, that's not a gate to teaching people that they can book on TripAdvisor. It's an optimization of giving our travelers the choice of where they want to book and to leverage the better pricing through the different channels.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Nat Schindler of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Nat H. Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Hi, guys. Of the 143 million hotel shoppers you had on average each month this quarter, what percentage of those are logged in with a credit card? And how is that trending? Sorry.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","We don't share that number, but the trend is obviously positive as we continue to vault a good portion of the credit cards as we move forward. I back it up a level and remind folks, one of the awesome things about the TripAdvisor business is that we had such reach, such scale, that 130 million shoppers a month, oh my goodness, it's just, it's phenomenal. But a lot of those shoppers were folks that had come in, taken a look and leave, and all we would know about them is their IP address, and we built a wonderful business over a decade-and-a-half doing that. But with IB, with instant booking, because we're now taking the transaction, all of those folks if they weren't already members are now becoming members as part of that process and we get to remarket to them, remind them that we exist, build more of the transaction loyalty. So again, that pays dividends for quite some time and obviously is a significant benefit of shifting or augmenting our meta model to be transactional.","Nat H. Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. And a quick follow-up that's totally unrelated. But as you go to Europe and you now have Priceline on instant book, obviously, they're a big bidder with Booking.com in European hotels on meta. Has it affected their \u2013 has them being in instant book affected their meta auction pricing or behaviors?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","I couldn't possibly answer from the perspective of what goes on inside of their companies and how they're choosing to bid on TripAdvisor, sorry. We point to a meta auction in the first quarter and say it was a very healthy auction. We have nice competition across our partner set. We in turn launched some additional capabilities to our partners in terms of enabling them to re-target using our platform, so it's a great opportunity. A number of partners have started to take advantage of it. It's, again, just another piece, another sign of commitment that we have that we're showing our partners to the meta auction building in this type of technology that allows them to bid more effectively and get the type of traffic that they want from our platform. So again, I couldn't comment on our partner specifically, but I can tell you that the meta auction is quite healthy right now.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Chris Merwin of Barclays. Your line is open.","Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you. I just had a couple questions. I guess the first is on the vacation rental space, I think you did another acquisition there and have I guess some 800,000 listings now and we've seen a few acquisitions in this space lately. I think, as it's become more attractive to some of the larger players in the space. I guess the question is, to the extent you do see more competition, can you talk about what that might mean for the cost of customer acquisition, particularly with SEM, and perhaps the long term margin for the business?","And then, just another question on macro, and apologies if this has been asked, but Priceline had mentioned they had some macro concerns. So just curious what impact, if any, you've seen from that, apart from the headwinds you had from instant book? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Well, there's been some movement on VR side with some of the other companies. I don't see the competitive landscape as having meaningfully changed. No particular reason to think being part of Expedia, the HomeAway companies will be behaving meaningfully differently. They are changing their business model, but it's a little hard for me to see meaningful change in our cost of traffic acquisition, or our margins there.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","What I would add is, what you see is that some of the smaller players are subscale at the moment, and the reason why we're making some of these acquisitions is because we see great scale benefits in adding some of these smaller players onto our platform.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","We are one of the sort of big players in the vacation rental space. We view it as a great alternative lodging type. As you know, as you well know, it's perfect for a certain type of traveler looking in a certain type of location, and we aim to, and we have been, quite successful at fulfilling that need.","So, the question on macro conditions, there was, what we believe to be, a small, limited impact from Brussels, and overall macro issues aren't something that is keeping us up at night.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Robert Peck of SunTrust. Your line is open. Hi, Robert. Please check to see if your line is on mute? Okay.","We will go to our next question from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you for taking the question. Steve, you've talked about attractions as being potentially your next $1 billion business. I was hoping we could get an early read on how you are thinking about instant book so far in attractions? I know the launch is pretty recent. And also, if you can talk about that space in instant book, in particular just from a structural kind of dynamics, and the degree to which that's much less competitive perhaps than what you are doing in terms of straight hotels? And then also, on the mix between meta and instant book over time, any thoughts long-term on how you think the mix of those two could shake out? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thanks, Doug, for those two excellent questions. I absolutely think attractions is a phenomenal business for us going forward. We're so well positioned because of the number of folks currently using the TripAdvisor app in market, and then you combine that with the supply that Viator already had before we made the acquisition. And then the tremendous efforts that that team, super kudos to that team, for picking up that much more supply on a regular repeatable basis. And we're by no means done. But we've now aggregated, we think, the best supply footprint around the globe. Match that with the best demand footprint around the globe, and we think this is an awesome, awesome business to be in. It's a pain in the neck to aggregate all of the individual suppliers, many of whom aren't using a lot of technology, with a lot of individual pieces along the way. Again, one of the reasons why we entered the space via \u2013 the supply piece via an acquisition, but now that we have it, now that a lot is bookable online instantly, now that we've learned how to match it with the TripAdvisor demand, not only on the phone for instant booking for attractions, but now on the desktop for instant booking on attractions, and you look at a business with a margin profile that's quite similar to hotels, and like wow, all the ingredients are there.","And that's not to say that we're the leader in every single market, it's not to say that it's straight sailing from here to there, we certainly have competition, but it's a natural fit for what travelers currently turn to TripAdvisor for. We have global reach, and we have global supply, in a nice margin business with some competitors, but it's not like we're coming from behind in any shape, or in any sense. So that's my short thesis to the $1 billion business because it's a market that, as you know, is phenomenally sized by itself.","To the second question on instant book versus meta in the longer-term mix, obviously, we expect instant book share to grow as we continue to roll it out, as we drive more repeat usage, but I really don't foresee the time when meta is an afterthought and it's just instant booking. I think there will be a large segment of the consumer base that has loyalty to a brand direct or an OTA or another OTA, one of our other clients. And they're very comfortable keeping that booking path, if you will, and TripAdvisor hopefully will facilitate that preference, be it directly with the brand, in instant book for the brand online, or any of the OTA partners. And we would hope that a number of OTA partners around the globe would wish to participate in our instant book marketplace as Priceline and getaroom and others have. So I don't model out a specific, but I do expect IB to grow, and I would never expect meta to disappear.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Steve D. Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Steve, I think about most of the questions have been addressed. I want to get your perspective on your restaurants business, and the long-term potential there? And how you may be looking to differentiate it versus OpenTable? Or how you might look to grow it globally? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thanks, Steve, for the question. Large component of our traffic is currently on restaurants. We've been investing over the past year in building up the usefulness of the product, both expanding the number of restaurants that we have all around the globe. We have a lot of restaurant reviews and info and engagement with restaurant owners around the globe. And we really haven't paid all that much attention to it product wise, prior to \u2013 from a monetization wise, prior to LaFourchette, to us purchasing LaFourchette. So, we feel on the restaurant reservation basis, the model that OpenTable has, we have the model enhanced with discounts in other parts of the world. And geographically it tends to be shaping up as OpenTable is super strong in their set of markets, and TheFork or LaFourchette is super strong in our set of markets. And it's hard for one to make an in-road into the other in any direction.","But that's not the only thing that we, or I presume OpenTable, can do in the restaurant space. So, we have a lot of traffic, we have a lot of eyeballs, we have a lot of app downloads, we have a lot of users engaging in learning about restaurants. We look at it as not only how can we help users find the best restaurant, how can we help users come back to TripAdvisor more and more often, leveraging the fact that they may only \u2013 or noting the fact that they may only travel a few times a year, but they're actually eating out several times a month. And how can we leverage that restaurant use case to drive overall adoption and engagement of our app. And those plans have been in place, and that's in part why we continue to invest in that category, not just the reservations piece, but the whole restaurants as part of the TripAdvisor solution.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Tom White of Macquarie. Your line is open.","Tom White - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you for taking the question. Just a question on marketing or driving awareness of instant booking. Steve, you mentioned the sweepstakes and the coupon, but I guess maybe those seem to me like relatively low-profile marketing maybe, or maybe lower impact (29:28) there. But I was wondering if maybe you could talk about the potential for more significant investment to promote instant booking, or maybe is that part of the Phase 4 strategy, once optimization of the path is exactly where you guys want it?","And then just secondarily, Steve, you talked about price as a critical factor in terms of whether people choose IB or meta. Do you guys have flexibility or ability to improve the way prices look? Or is that not really something you can influence? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure, two good questions. Thanks. So on the marketing side, we do believe that we can make significant inroads in any particular market by focusing on the audience that is already in travel research and purchase mode. And we have 100-plus million of those already on our site in any given month. So that's a lot of traffic and we really want to hone that message. So I wouldn't put or at least we don't think of our on-site promotions as kind of small or kind of not being able to move the needle for us in terms of awareness. U.S. is where we're choosing to focus now because the product is the most mature, the pricing is the best, and we've had longer to tune the user experience. So, I'd say, steady-as-she-goes from a marketing perspective on teaching folks to trial instant book as we improve their ability to come back and use instant book again.","In terms of price, as you know, we don't take the booking ourselves from charging the credit card perspective. We're taking all this information and we're sending it along to our instant book partner, be it the independent hotel, the brand, or the OTA. So, we don't have the ability, or we choose not to create the ability, to offer a price discount ourselves. We have no interest in having our OTA. We're looking to offer the best price that is out there on the web via the TripAdvisor instant book strategy. So, no matter who the OTA is, no matter who the individual hotelier is, come put your pricing in our instant book environment and therefore, we'll be able to offer it as the best. And if we don't have the best, well our meta-offering, if you're a meta-partner, can also show an even better price than IB and you do see that on the site sometimes.","Pricing, as any OTA will tell you, is a longtail game. There's no one magic bullet, no one site out there has the absolute best pricing anywhere, but that is the Holy Grail that everyone looks for, and we're no exception to that. We think our model is extremely well suited to being able to offer consumers the best pricing via meta, and great pricing in almost all cases using our instant book initiative, where we've stored the credit card. So we're building you the convenience to come back because you'll always find the best price. But that takes a while, and we wouldn't be trying to do that by offering price discounts on our end because we're not the merchant of record.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Robert Peck of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Robert S. Peck - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Can you hear me?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes, we can.","Robert S. Peck - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you. Sorry about the issues there. I am not sure what that was. Couple of quick questions if you don't mind, one is, Google has rolled out a product on mobile and we're just curious, if you're seeing any impact from that? And then number two, following up on Chris's macro question, particularly, we are curious on the RevPAR side of things. If you're seeing RevPAR pressures impact the business at all? Thanks so much.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure, Robert. So, Google has been doing a lot over the years, quite a few years now in the travel space. What can I say? They continue to try to get into the travel space. They have a phenomenal ability with their search engine to direct traffic to their own products, even when the consumers demonstrably do not like that. To this particular product, the new mobile offering, I'd say way too early for anyone to have a meaningful opinion on it. It's not really likely, in my opinion, to have a big impact on the transaction components of a site. Its way up in the discovery set, but time will tell whether they'll continue to invest in that.","On the RevPAR, we tend as a business not to track our financials on RevPAR. We look at our top of funnel metrics, how many people can we get in the store, and how quickly can we convert them, as fundamentally RevPAR isn't something that we have any control over.","Robert S. Peck - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Kevin Kopelman of Cowen & Co. Your line is open.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks a lot. First, could you just give us a better sense, if you haven't already, on the Q2 revenue growth projection versus the Q1 in the Hotel segment? Should we expect bigger declines there compared to Q1 just given the rollout? And then just to follow-up on HouseTrip, can you give us any more metrics, what the acquisition price was and contribution expected this year? Thanks a lot.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Hey, Kevin. This is Ernst. As you know, we are not giving explicit guidance for the full year, nor for the second quarter. However, we did few months ago and we're reiterating that, described the pattern of the year, and what we described is, in the first half of the year, we expect revenue deceleration, and you've seen that in Q1. And in the back half of the year, we see revenue growth rates expand again. And that is as much as we want to comment on the profile for the year.","In terms of HouseTrip, we have not disclosed a purchase price for HouseTrip, which in itself indicates that it wasn't very material, and the impact it will make will be helpful for our vacation rental business, but not significantly material for their overall financial results for the year.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Ernst.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo securities. Your line is open.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to go back to IB\/meta. If we think about the desktop experience in the U.S. versus the mobile experience, consumers coming into the funnel, can you give us a sense of the preference for IB versus meta, how it might differ on the desktop versus the mobile? And then secondly, on a separate topic, wondering if you could comment on loyalty programs. Is there an expansion of loyalty program activity by various partners a threat to Trip? There's obviously different opinions among your partners on how valuable they are. I wonder if you could offer your thoughts on that topic? Thanks so much.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Certainly. Yes, we do see a meaningful difference in IB adoption on desktop versus phone. Not surprisingly, instant book is used a lot more, and represents a higher percentage of our phone revenue. Our credit card vault rate, as we call it, how many people store their credit card after a transaction, is much higher on the phone. Credit card usage, vaulted credit card usage rate, is higher on the phone. Again, all kind of after-the-fact evidence that having instant book on the phone, as people move more and more their transactions to the phone, is a good thing to have, we believe a requirement to have, to be a credible offering in the future. So, yes, we see a difference and yes, it's kind of as expected.","The second question is, loyalty programs a threat? Yes. Every program that tries to drive a consumer to go straight to a booking site that's not TripAdvisor is taking a customer that we would like to service and making them loyal somewhere else. We know they've been around for a long time, some of the biggest players don't have them, and seem to be doing great. So, obviously, I have no inside knowledge, but I would assume those programs would continue to grow in terms of visibility. And everyone has some set of reasons why a secret deal here or there, as to why one might want to go back to the site. TripAdvisor has our set of reasons why you want to come to TripAdvisor, namely the incredible content, the candid photos, the room tips, to being able to compare all the prices, because nobody wants a secret deal on a particular site, if in fact that's not better than what you can find elsewhere.","And of course, through Instant Book, or through Meta, we can allow our clients to offer their special deals, or their special offers, to our audience as well, should they choose. We don't think the dynamics around consumer loyalty have changed all that much over the past set of years, so, while it's on the horizon, it's not something that I think will materially change behavior over the next several years.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jed Kelly of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Where are you in terms of launching your own retargeting product? And besides generating additional revenue for your metasearch partners from this product, can developing an internal retargeting product potentially ease some of the recent deleverage in online advertising?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","So I'm not entirely sure the question. I can tell you what you do \u2013 and then I'll tell you what we do, and then I'll ask you for a follow-up, if it's not clear. So we currently, for our online marketing campaigns, leverage retargeting as we buy TripAdvisor traffic that left TripAdvisor and is on other third-party sites, and we buy them back with banner ads and search retargeting. From a \u2013 what we offer our clients, if a visitor is on a site, for instance Expedia, and then are visiting TripAdvisor, we allow the client to bid differently in the meta-auction, in order to determine \u2013 in order to reflect the fact that that visitor may be worth more or less than the average visitor they get from TripAdvisor, and that's rolled out. And more and more partners are adopting that, just as a way to optimize their bidding strategy, exactly in the same way that TripAdvisor looks to optimize our bidding strategy when we acquire traffic to our site. So, much the same, sort of on a conceptual basis, for how that's done.","If that \u2013 go ahead.","Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I'm sorry, I guess my question was more around, as you develop more of an internal retargeting product, can that potentially ease some of the reliance on some of the third-party ad tech platforms you use?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","The third-party ad tech platforms that we use to acquire traffic to TripAdvisor?","Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes, such as Criteo?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","No. I mean, I don't \u2013 the platform that we have developed is for our clients to use rebuying, or remarketing, to the traffic that was on their site and is now on TripAdvisor. Criteo or anyone else, they can't do that. They can't offer that, that's something that we had to offer ourselves. And then, since we buy traffic elsewhere on the web, we're not trying to get into the business that Criteo is in by way of a broad ad tech platform.","We have a huge audience, we will offer, to our CPM clients, the ability to buy \u2013 to spend on TripAdvisor and buy a banner ad for Hilton, for instance, that is placed on TripAdvisor, and is also placed on a third-party site to a visitor that was on TripAdvisor. So we do offer that, it's a growing part of our business, it's a nice part of our business. It doesn't really affect our reliance on other ad tech platforms one way or the other.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Brian Fitzgerald of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, guys. Maybe a couple quick ones. In terms of building out the content with respect to IB attractions or vacation rentals, or any one of your channels. To what extent is that both a joint exercise on your part, but also in conjunction with your partners? And then two quick ones. Can you remind us what the exclusivity concerns are around booking.com and their IB relationship, when do those expire? And then as you embark on phase three of your IB roadmap, how long do you envision that phase kind of playing out? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure, I'm not sure I quite followed on the partnership piece. When we kind of add content, the room descriptions, room tips, we're doing that ourselves. If the content you're referring to is more pricing and more availability of rooms. Well, that's our supply footprint for hotels or attractions or restaurants, and we have our teams going out and getting more and more supply. With that supply comes just more choice in rooms and tours and attractions.","So with our partners \u2013 well, you can ask a follow-up if I'm missing the point on that one. We don't really comment on partner contracts with respect to things like the Booking.com contract.","You've seen more and more suppliers be added to our Instant Book offering over time, and we continue to add partners every single quarter. So we have a lot of flexibility to deliver the product that we want to our customers. Was there something in the partner contracts I missed?","Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC","No. Then the last one, Steve, was just as you embark on phase three, have you talked about how long you envision phase three playing out?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","The phases are meant kind of as guideposts. We're certainly already doing a little bit of phase four right now, because we're trying to get people to do more and more repeat bookings. That's great, we've been improving the experience, educating folks which is phase three. We were starting that in phase two. So they are fuzzy, but we've articulated them, because hey, everyone had seen IB in the U.S., but we wanted to remind everyone the clock is just now starting to run on the rest of the major countries throughout the world. That's great. And this phase coming forward is less about intro, less about rollout, and now about honing that user experience and driving the behavior that we want.","Certainly, if you want to combine three and four, the phase lasts forever. If you want to split them out, phase three will be a while.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Dan Wasiolek of Morningstar. Your line is open.","Dan Wasiolek - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So in the Non-Hotel segment considering the shift to transaction and vacation rental. When we think about the progression of revenue growth for the rest of 2016 into 2017, should it be something similar to the commentary that you've given on the Hotel side? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes, Dan. Thanks for asking that question. We made a comment in the prepared remarks about our vacation rental business. What we outlined is, and this is happening both in Instant Booking and in vacation rental, is as we move our business models, and we've talked about Instant Booking, but if you look at vacation rentals, we're moving our business model in vacation rental, we have progressively over the last year.","So if you look at Q1, 2015, we had a small portion of the revenues recognized on stay and other elements of revenue recognized on book or on subscription. And as we migrated over the year, now we're in Q1 2016, we see that a substantial portion of our revenues is recognized on stay. So that has a significant impact, particularly on the seasonality of our business. Q1 is a quarter in vacation rentals in which there are a lot of bookings for later in the year for Q2, but specifically for the summer in Q3.","And so what you see if you compare the year-on-year growth rates is what you see is that the total of 14% year-on-year growth for Non-Hotel, which is not just vacation rentals obviously is suppressed by that impact. And as we look out for the full year, we believe the growth rate for Non-Hotel will be significantly north of that 14% for the whole year because of that seasonal \u2013 additional seasonality that has been built-in, with this change of business model.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. I just wanted to get for the model, if you can give us a sense of what percent deferred revenue relates to IB versus other? And then on your comments around the launch of preferred pricing for loyalty programs at some of the larger chain hotels. Is there either through Meta or through Instant Book a model where you could see yourself participating in those priority pricing programs?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","I'll take the first question there. We have not broken out the relative impact of IB and other. It \u2013 however, if you look at businesses where we have been booking at stay, right, consumption for a longer time, like attractions, for instance, attraction doesn't have a big impact on that growth rate impact, but it's really localized to Instant Booking and vacation rentals. But we don't want to give any further breakdown beyond that.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And this is Steve. With respect to why the pricing initiatives that some of the big hotel chains have put on with kind of special rates, we can absolutely see a case in point or an example set where those brands choose to push their special pricing onto the TripAdvisor meta and\/or IB platforms such that they want the exposure of some great rates. And our perspective is if it's a rate that's available to travelers, then we're happy to show it. So our model sort of encourages travelers to find the absolute \u2013 I mean, if you wind it all the way back, folks are coming to TripAdvisor because they love the site, it offers that great user experience, the full trip.","They have more content, more choice, pricing is a key component of that. They find the things, the place they want to stay and the things that they want to do. They make the bookings on TripAdvisor if the price is great, and brands play into that, if they are giving us their best pricing. They find what they want to do, they book those pieces on TripAdvisor to have the great trip, to share the experience back on TripAdvisor, to therefore, become more engaged with our site, and again more likely to share their experience with their friends about how TripAdvisor helped them and start their very next bit of travel planning with us.","Having the price from the brands is the \u2013 the best price from all components is one of the many things that we need to do right in order to earn that virtuous cycle.","Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, I'll turn the call back over to Steve Kaufer for closing remarks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Great. Well, thanks, everyone for joining the call. The first quarter 2016 was pivotal for TripAdvisor. We still have a lot of work ahead of us but we're making great strides towards our goal of building that best user experience in travel. I want to thank our employees around the globe for their continued hard work, and we look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. And now, I would like to introduce your host for today, Will Lyons, Senior Director of Investor Relations.","Will Lyons","Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to TripAdvisor's first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. I'm Will Lyons, and joining me on the call today are our CEO, Steve Kaufer; and our CFO, Julie Bradley.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the estimates and other forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's views as of today, May 7, 2013. TripAdvisor disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. Please refer to today's earnings release and TripAdvisor's filings with the SEC for information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","You'll also find reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures discussed on this call in our Q1 earnings release, which is available on our IR site, ir.tripadvisor.com.","Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and technology and content expense excludes stock-based compensation, and all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable periods of 2012.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen Kaufer","Thank you, Will, and welcome, everyone. 2013 has gotten off to a great start for TripAdvisor as we strive to create the best experience for every user on every device in every geography. I'm going to highlight some key metrics, update you on our ongoing Meta initiative and briefly discuss some notable developments pertaining to some of our strategic growth initiatives. Julie will then provide color on our financials and outlook.","We were pleased to see strong traffic growth during the first quarter as total TripAdvisor unique monthly users grew at 54% year-over-year. Notably, unique hotel shoppers accelerated to 41% year-over-year growth, according to our log files, up from 35% growth that we saw in both last quarter and in Q1 2012. TripAdvisor branded sites topped 200 million average monthly unique visitors during the quarter, according to Google Analytics. We were also thrilled to be able to announce that we now publish over 100 million reviews and opinions, further solidifying our leading position in the travel research funnel.","Our hotel shopper growth, coupled with strong pricing in all geographies, showed 24% revenue growth in our core click-based business. Our other products also fared well as display revenue reaccelerated to 14% growth and subscription and other revenue grew 50% year-over-year. Collectively, this led to a strong Q1 total revenue and EBITDA growth of 25% and 30%, respectively.","Our underlying fundamentals are indeed very strong, providing a nice backdrop for our exciting product initiative that we outlined on our last earnings call, adding hotel metasearch functionality to all TripAdvisor websites.","To paraphrase consumer feedback, our new Meta Display has taken the work out of shopping for the best price. Users love finding out whether their hotel is available and how much their stay will cost, alongside all of the helpful reviews, traveler photos, room tips and the rest of the valuable user-generated content that we offer.","We began our metasearch rollout in Q4 initially to 100% of our smartphone traffic. We then started testing on desktop and tablet in Q1. And as of today, we have more than half of our worldwide traffic on meta. At this point, all traffic from Brazil, Canada, Germany, India, Ireland, Singapore and the U.K. have been fully transitioned to meta.","On the other points of sale, approximately 19% of our desktop and tablet users are seeing meta today with a goal of ramping to 100% globally by the end of June.","Partners are benefiting from this meta transition as well as early data suggests that our hotel shopper leads are converting to bookings at much higher rates. We've seen our bid position and bid recommendation reports help partners make quicker and more informed ROI decisions. Additionally, upgrades to our bidding platform now allow partners the ability to change bids daily, and many large partners are updating bids several times per week.  These tools help us further deepen our relationships with our partners, and we expect that our bidding platform will continue to become more efficient as we roll out to 100% meta implementation.","From a monetization standpoint, partners are paying us a CPC -- partners are paying us CPC rates that are several times greater than historical CPC rates based upon the improved conversion of our leads. And while we have made great progress toward our goal of revenue-neutral transition to meta, there's still work to be done, namely, we must continue to improve the conversion rate of hotel shoppers to revenue-generating clicks while simultaneously improving our client-facing bidding tools to help our partners spend effectively on our platform.","Remember that while we control the...","[Technical Difficulty]","Based upon expected improvements in conversion rates and the natural competitive dynamics of an auction, we now expect to achieve revenue neutrality by the end of the year.","I'll now touch upon some interesting developments in a few of our growth initiatives. Our mobile offerings remain some of our fastest-growing products in terms of users, hotel shoppers and revenues. Average monthly mobile uniques of 62 million was up about 300% year-over-year. The new meta functionality is working great on both these devices, and 2 weeks ago, we introduced a significant update of our smartphone app experience. A key objective of this redesign was to provide a more refined, engaging interface that includes larger photos, and we are working on a similar refresh of our tablet app and tablet web experience to make it easier and more delightful to quickly discover helpful travel information.","Also, through our recently announced Samsung partnership, TripAdvisor will be preinstalled on the new GALAXY smartphones, a device which, at an expected 10 million units per month, is likely to be a bestseller for Samsung. We are excited by what this could mean for global brand distribution and end market user engagement. In addition to preinstalling TripAdvisor's industry-leading app, Samsung is using TripAdvisor's user-generated content to power its Travel Widget, Lock Screen Slideshow and City Information in Samsung Story Album.","In our Vacation Rental business, the big news is that we have launched a new free-to-list transaction-based option for property owners, and early results are quite positive. Overall listings are up as well as inquiries.","On the property owner side, offering 2 distinct listing options increases choice and thereby expands our supply footprint. As other transaction-oriented rental sites have shown, having a free option for owners is a great way to reduce sign-up friction and build inventory.","On the consumer side, having more properties on display gives potential renters more choice and drives more inquiries and bookings. We've also seen that free-to-list property owners respond more quickly to inquiries, creating a much better user experience.","We believe that supplementing our healthy and growing subscription-based option with the free-to-list model will help facilitate long-term, sustainable growth in this product line.","Augmenting all of this organic growth and innovation, we have also been busy on the acquisition front. Late in Q1, we added the mobile postcard business, TinyPost, and we will be integrating this ability to send postcards while in destination into both our TripAdvisor and City Guide apps. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we added the leading travel flash sale site Jetsetter, cruise research and planning site CruiseWise, and a leading Spanish vacation rental site, Niumba, to the TripAdvisor family. All are nice, strategic complements to our traveler value proposition. We continue to actively look for great ideas, teams and opportunities to accelerate our product road map and to enhance our global competitive positioning.","Finally, as I mentioned previously, when hotel metasearch is live to 100% of our traffic, we will kick off our off-line branding campaign. We are scheduled to begin testing our first TV ad later this quarter, and you should expect us -- expect to see us on air in a meaningful way starting in Q3 in the U.S. As always, we will test and learn. At this point, we expect to launch in at least a couple of other countries before the year is out.","In summary, we're off and running in 2013, investing in our people, technology to deliver an even better user experience for our users and our customers. I want to acknowledge the entire TripAdvisor team and all TripAdvisor users for their contributions to making the site better every day.","I'll now turn the call over to Julie, who will provide some color on the financial results as well as our outlook.","Julie M. B. Bradley","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As Steve just described, we're seeing very healthy traffic trends, and this is providing a nice backdrop for revenue growth. The first quarter came in better than we had expected as hotel shopper growth and better pricing drove our core click-based business. Total revenue and profit growth accelerated to 25% and 30%, respectively. Assuming constant currency, total revenue would have been 1% lower.","Our Q1 click-based revenue was up 24% fueled by hotel shopper growth of 41%. The delta between the 2 growth rates can be attributed to 3 factors: mobile, international and our transition to meta. Hotel shoppers on smartphones grew well over 100% this past quarter but monetized at less than 20% at desktops. To that end, we believe that approximately 5% to 10% of the delta between hotel shopper growth and revenue growth is, and will likely continue to be, due to smartphones. We see a similar trend with international hotel shoppers.","The geographic mix of our traffic growth continues to skew to higher growth countries that monetize at lower levels. We believe the impact of this is a 5% to 10% delta between hotel shopper growth and revenue growth.","The final reconciling item is meta. This past quarter, the meta rollout negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 3% to 5%. We expect this negative impact will be greater in Q2 and then start to recover in the back half of the year as we approach revenue neutrality.","Specific to geographic mix, revenue from international points of sale was 50% of total revenue during the quarter, which was consistent with Q4 and up from 48% in the first quarter of 2012.","As previewed on our last call, we are now providing additional geographical color on North America, EMEA, LatAm and APAC, which is in line with how we measure the business internally. Specifically, hotel shoppers continued to grow rapidly on our APAC and LatAm points of sale, and we've seen pricing recover in every geography except for APAC, where pricing was relatively flat.","In our display-based business, revenue growth reaccelerated to 14% year-over-year due to traffic growth, better sell-through rates and slightly higher prices.","Subscription, transaction and other revenue, which includes Business Listings, Vacation Rentals and our transaction businesses, had a good Q1, growing 51% and in line with our full year expectations.","2013 revenue and cost contributions from our CruiseWise, Jetsetter, Niumba and TinyPost acquisitions are factored into our forecasts starting in Q2 given the timing of those transactions.","As expected, overall expenses for the quarter decreased as a percent of revenue sequentially primarily due to how revenue seasonality impacts our largely fixed cost structure. This past quarter's hiring progressed slower than anticipated, so we're gaining some benefit there. But we continue to increase direct marketing costs on an absolute basis in an effort to diversify traffic, expand internationally and fuel user engagement through social networks. These investment initiatives, including our upcoming off-line marketing campaign, are important pieces of our long-term growth strategy.","Moving on to taxes, our Q1 GAAP effective tax rate was 26% due to our continued geographic mix shift towards lower foreign tax jurisdictions. This is in line with our expectations that our 2013 effective tax rate would be in the mid to high 20s.","CapEx was $9.3 million for the quarter or 4% of revenue. Due to our continued strong traffic growth, we are slightly raising our CapEx expectations for the full year from approximately 4% of revenue to approximately 6% of revenue.","We ended the quarter with $597 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities. We have $370 million of long-term debt outstanding and a currently undrawn credit facility of $200 million.","With regard to shares outstanding, fully diluted share count was 144.7 million. We expect -- we continue to expect fully diluted share count will increase 3% to 4% over 2012 year-end levels based on employee equity grants at various stock price assumptions. However, it does not assume stock repurchases under our board-approved $250 million buyback program. Due to the timing of the approval of this program late last quarter, we were unable to buy back shares, but it is our intention to do so over the balance of the year.","With that, let me provide updated thoughts on our 2013 outlook.","For click-based revenue, based on what we've seen so far in our meta rollout, we do not expect meta to be revenue-neutral by the end of the second quarter, resulting in increased revenue headwinds for Q2 and Q3.","Baking in our better-than-expected Q1 results, including the assumption that hotel shopper growth will remain strong, offset by a longer-than-expected time line to achieve revenue neutrality in our meta transition, we now expect click-based revenue growth in the high teens to low 20s for full year 2013.","Assuming continued strong traffic growth, good conversion metrics and stable pricing, in late 2013 and into 2014, we expect to see reacceleration due to our strong top-of-funnel traffic trends.","Based on our strong Q1 results, we now expect display-based revenue growth in the low double digits for the full year, with Q4 being the strongest quarter. Given our better-than-expected new subscriptions in Business Listings and expected contributions from our recent acquisitions, we now expect full year subscription, transaction and other revenue growth in the mid-50s. Adding it up, we are reiterating our low 20% total revenue growth expectation for the full year.","As a reminder, this outlook does not contemplate a meaningful lift in repeat visits or traffic from our planned off-line ad campaign. So that could provide some upside from a traffic and revenue standpoint.","On the expense side, our investment and hiring plans remain unchanged. So the increase in click-based revenue headwinds in Q2 and Q3 will fall directly to the bottom line.","From a profitability standpoint, our meta transition, coupled with our ongoing investment plans, recent acquisitions and our fixed-cost structure, could result in negative EBITDA growth in Q3 and Q4 due to the timing of our off-line ad campaign. Accordingly, we now expect 2013 EBITDA growth in the mid-single-digit range.","In conclusion, we performed very well in the first quarter across many of our product and growth initiatives. We are seeing record total visitor and hotel shopper growth and are making great strides innovating and improving the TripAdvisor experience for both users and advertisers on our site.","We'll now open the call up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  We'll take our first question coming from Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you can just comment on the revised guidance on the click-based revenue. It sounds like hotel shopper growth is firing on all cylinders and doing better than expected, and yet it sounds like the headwinds from meta are a little bit stronger. Can you parse out what it is? Is it just people not clicking as much because prices are shown on the site versus not getting pricing lift as much as you thought? And then when you talk to revenue neutrality, does that contemplate any pickup in users who are using the site for commercial activity because it's a better user experience? Or is that purely kind of a pricing neutrality that doesn't contemplate any usage gains from just a better experience?","Stephen Kaufer","Certainly. So as you -- as Julie had bridged from the super strong hotel shopper growth down to the revenue growth, you had the 5% to 10% in the increase in phone, you had the 5% to 10% for just the international skewed to the lower monetization. And we would certainly expect that monetization in those newer points of sale to improve over time, but we're reporting what we're seeing. And meta, of course, is the most interesting for us to chat about, I think, because that's really the big transition that the company is going through. We had projected sort of fewer clicks per session; that came true. We had projected a much higher CPC for each of those clicks, and that came true. And so as we go forward, we're basically not at the point yet where I can swap them out and not see a revenue hit. We're still sort of in the negative. And we predict both an increase in the conversion rate, and where people that are going to generate clicks, as well as an increase in the average price that we're paid from our clients to hit the revenue neutrality. To your question on -- or to your point on am I assuming anything by way of people coming back more because the meta experience is better, the answer is no. I look at that as wonderful upside. But given that travel is rather episodic, I'm not sure I'm going to be able to see that within a month or 2 versus the next trip. So I'm certainly counting on the fact over the long term, and this is our big bet that we totally believe in, that by delivering this better experience, by delivering the notion that not only can you pick the perfect hotel for you because of all this incredibly rich content, we've scoured the Internet, found you the best price as well. And there is in a lot of parts of the world -- in many parts of the world a meaningful price discrepancy that we're now helping users sort through and save them money on the trip. So you combine both of those. We get our message out. And yes, there'll be some short-term revenue pain that kind of we consciously decided we're willing to take right now because that user experiences is that much better, and we expect to get it back in spades in outgoing years, not part of the revenue-neutral equation.","Operator","And our next question is from Nat Schindler from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Nathaniel H. Schindler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two questions. One, how are your large OTA clients reacting to you stepping up, seemingly, buying your own keywords with Tinga -- Tingo, and then additionally your recent acquisition of Jetsetter kind of moving into that -- more of the OTA space? Additionally, when you were -- are testing out meta right now, have you instituted kind of minimum pricing to play ball in the kind of transition time frame? Or is it just really going to no-auction for these and let the advertisers figure it out, the value of the increased conversions?","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. Thanks, Nate. I'll answer both. So I really haven't heard much from the large or the small OTAs on how they feel about Tingo buying on TripAdvisor, nor really anything on Jetsetter. We've been in the transaction space for quite some time now with SniqueAway and with Tingo. Vacation Rentals is now transaction. They're not part of TripAdvisor. They're part of the TripAdvisor Media Group. So the fact that we have these things in our other companies doesn't seem to be bothering our clients. To the question of minimum pricing on meta, yes, we do have minimum pricing. It's successfully moved to a per-property minimum pricing. I -- and I view it more as a failsafe or a preventative policy just in case there's a single OTA and they're the only ones that can sell one of the properties that we have. And without a minimum price, they might bid $0.05 when the minimum price might be $1.00. So we force them to bid $1.00. We know they're making money on it. So it's not a challenge for us to enforce a minimum at this point. The money -- most of the CPC money that we make are the OTAs and suppliers that are bidding for that #1 or #2 slot, and those are almost always above the minimum because the auction is going. So yes, we have minimum, but the actual level that we set it at isn't determining a big portion of our revenue because the vast majority of our properties have a healthy auction going, and the auction determines the revenue.","Operator","And our next question comes from Scott Devitt from Morgan Stanley.","Nishant Verma - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Nishant for Scott Devitt. You mentioned a 5% to 10% headwind from hotel shopper to CPC revenue growth due to international. I was just wondering, do you expect the monetization gap between international and domestic to narrow? And then what would be the main drivers? Or is it -- or some of it just structurally different?","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. I -- so I want to be clear. Some international countries have wonderfully healthy CPC rates even though they might be slightly newer geographies for us. So I can't lump all of international. But there are certainly some countries out there that are quite large and fast growing where the general hotel landscape isn't lending itself to the higher CPCs at this point in time. Japan might have been an example where CPCs -- even though it's certainly a mature market or robust market, the merchant model doesn't play as strong a role for domestic properties as perhaps in some other countries. So the average CPC might be lower. I'd say overall, we like the general trend. More properties come online. More competition comes online. And as more transactions happen online, the hoteliers pay more attention to the channel and are more interested in the traffic, and we're one of those sources of traffic. So overall, trend's in our favor, would expect that to continue. And very few markets have anything that I would say is a structural issue in place that would prevent CPCs from approaching our mature markets.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Michael Purcell from Stifel.","Michael B. Purcell - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","On the mobile side, you gave the app data you're up about 300% to 62 million downloads. And if I remember correctly, I think you're up about 200% the last quarter. So it's clearly accelerating. You gave what the monetization was at 20% net for the smartphone, but I was wondering if you could update us on the tablet monetization, if it's similar to the desktop now or close to. And secondly, I'm just wondering if you're seeing an improvement just from internal logs on the conversion rates within the mobile app.","Stephen Kaufer","Okay, so let me go back and correct some of that stuff. The 300% growth was kind of all mobile. So it's mobile web, mobile app, tablet and phone. It was 62 million visitors, monthly visitors, not downloads. So we have grown downloads, but that was a different number. We've, I think, modestly improved the monetization on our smartphone, and that is something we pay attention to because we do see that 100% hotel shopper growth on the phone. And while it's not going to grow at 100% for the next 5 years, we still expect, for the next year, for it to grow strong, and we need to start monetizing that better. And we're just turning our attention to it now as the numbers have gotten larger. Tablet, we're already approaching the same monetization levels as desktop. I don't frankly see any reason why they won't be the same or even better in the not-too-distant future. So the extent to which tablet replaces desktop for folks planning a vacation, that's fine with me. I don't think TripAdvisor is necessarily any better or worse off. Arguably, we're better because we have a really nice app and it's a great user experience, better for photos, and you get to use your fingers to swipe and all the rest of that. So very comfortable with tablet growth, and we're seeing a ton of it. Smartphone, working on monetization now and expect to see improvements going forward. And I think that covered it.","Michael B. Purcell - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And my apologies. It's 36 million app downloads. I had the numbers backwards.","Stephen Kaufer","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan.","Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I was just hoping you'd provide a little bit more color on the impact from the meta transition. So of the -- just trying to understand the 3% to 5% sort of drag in 1Q and then the greater than that in 2Q. Is that being driven more on the volume side or the pricing side relative to your expectations? And then can you comment on the speed at which OTAs and other advertisers are adjusting their prices relative to conversion rates?","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. So 2 great parts of the question there, Doug. The meta transition, so we had started at 10% or so in the beginning of the quarter and have ramped up to the point where we're close to 50% on our desktop tablet traffic base. We had already rolled out 100% on phones. So the 3% to 5% drag in Q1 was a relatively -- was a much lower percentage rollout on average than what you'll see in Q2 at a worse monetization rate because we hadn't done the on-site conversions and our partners had not had a chance to adjust their bids, or some of them had, but a bunch of them hadn't, and so we were going through. And part of the back story is as you roll something out at a 10% level, we have to get our partners' attention to, \"Hey, come on, start bidding up on meta, you're losing share here to a competitor.\" But it was only losing some percentage of share on a 10% slice of our traffic. So again, not the wake-up call that we wanted to send, saying, \"Get ready, guys, this is coming,\" and we kind of need that wake-up call to move the bids. So we work pretty darn closely with our major clients, prepping them, working on the tools, working on being able to allow them to make changes, making recommendations, \"Hey, here's where you can, for a small amount of extra money, bid up and start to gain share on your competition,\" in order to move the pricing towards what we'll call break-even pricing, break-even's the wrong -- what we'll call fair pricing on the part of the client side, where they're still spending on TripAdvisor at the same efficiency that they were before. And we feel that, that's a perfectly reasonable goal. So the OTAs, the big OTAs, are now up to speed. They're bidding as frequently as they're ready to in most markets. And since we're fully rolled out in a number of big markets, including the U.K., which is a very big market for us, we're seeing a robust bid environment. We think our clients are still learning where they sit, they're still digesting some share reports from us, they're still playing around with what happens when you bid up and bid down. But we always knew it would take a little time for them to figure out the right level of efficiency versus share. As in Q2, you can say, all right, well, it's mid-May, and you got close to 50% of our desktop traffic on meta now. And by end of June, you're at 100%. So you can take a reasonable guess as to the pretty significant average percentage for the quarter, while we still haven't recovered as much as we would have liked to in the conversion and the pricing. So that's why we're saying, hey, Q2 is going to be a bigger revenue hit as we work through improving the conversion pricing through Q3. So if we're able to hit our rollout objectives, you'll have all of Q3 and beyond at 100%, but we'll have clawed back a lot of the revenue loss through pricing gains and conversion. Our basic philosophy was -- or to preempt another question, perhaps, why hurry up and do this? It's basically we looked at that user experience and said, \"Wow, it's really that much better.\" And since TripAdvisor has so many travelers visiting every single day, we really didn't want to spend any more time than we had to teaching new travelers about the old pop-up window mechanism versus showing the brand-new meta experience, which is so much better. So it's a bit more pain earlier than we had thought before. But in our view, clearly worth it when you take the 2014-and-beyond view.","Operator","And our next question is from Tom White from Macquarie.","Thomas C. White - Macquarie Research","On the off-line ad campaign, I was hoping maybe you guys could provide a bit more detail on precisely when that may launch. Is it a 3Q or a 4Q event? And then how can we think about your expectations about how sort of rebranding the property with this new metasearch functionality might help kind of convert a bigger part of your traffic into traffic that generates real revenues for you guys? And then just secondly on the revenue guidance, I think you affirmed guidance, but can you parse out the impact of the recent M&A deals? I imagine Jetsetter's the biggest piece, but maybe in aggregate, kind of what that's contributing in terms of revenues this year.","Stephen Kaufer","So thanks, Tom. I'll try to answer some of those at least. The off-line ad campaign, again very pleased that we're able to get a test ad out this quarter, fingers crossed, and that'll help us both test the message as well as test our ability to measure the impact of that ad. And so I'm not necessarily talking raw dollars, but, hey, are we generating more traffic to our site, are we generating some more awareness that is measurable, because we want to test it before it rolls out. When we look -- and that's one of the reasons we're starting in the U.S. It's just easier for us to measure some of the stuff. In terms of the better color in Q3, we really don't know at this point what the media campaign would look like and where it would ramp. It's not ideal from a timing perspective because ideally, you'd love to have everything already in market in Q2, Q3 because that's sort of peak travel season around here, whereas we're still learning and trying all sorts of different stuff in Q3 as we continually ramp our spend. And Q4 may not be the best time from an ROI perspective, but, unfortunately, the product wasn't ready to start the campaign earlier. So there we have it. In terms of rebranding, we don't expect meta to have a meaningful impact on taking folks who are currently not hotel shoppers and turning them into hotel shoppers, if that was the question. We get a ton of free traffic looking at restaurants and attractions. Our off-line branding, our stickers, our campaigns drive people to come and look on TripAdvisor, \"What do I want to do when I'm in a city?\" If they weren't a hotel shopper before, they're probably not going to be a hotel shopper now because those attraction pages aren't fundamentally changing. Our hope is that folks will start to spread the word on their own, having a great experience on the meta product. And so we would see a lift in overall repeat usage of hotel shoppers. And a bunch of that other traffic eventually needs to book a hotel, so, hopefully, they'll come back to TripAdvisor to do it. To the financial impact of acquisitions, I'll turn it over to Julie. I'm not sure there's much that we'll be able to add, but...","Julie M. B. Bradley","Yes. So we're not going to be breaking out the exact impact of the recent acquisitions, but I will say that a key driver in increasing the guidance in our subscription, transaction and other revenue line is related to the 4 recent transactions and just [indiscernible]. And on the decrease in our EBITDA guidance, the contributing factor there, too, was the recent acquisitions we made.","Operator","And our next question is from Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up to the -- to beat the dead horse here on meta. I understand that you won't be at overall company-wide revenue neutrality for meta until year end. But in those markets where the transition is 100% complete, like in the U.K., could you provide any indication of if you are at or near revenue neutrality now in those markets?","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. We are not at revenue neutrality in those markets now. If we were, then I -- we haven't been 100% live in the U.K. for that long, so if we had achieved revenue neutrality in both conversion and pricing in a few short weeks, wow, I would have given a completely different set of expectations. So again, to be clear, there's a fair amount of our best guess in this. We're convinced the transition is the right thing for the company, for our visitors, for our long-term growth, for the user experience. We may make up the revenue in terms of all on the conversion side. We make it all up in pricing. We may make half and half. We may do x percent better in both, and it may end up being a revenue positive. At this point, since we've made the decision to switch over 100%, in a sense we're just back to our standard operating procedure of hey, we're always looking to maximize the revenue from every hotel shopper or from all visitors but primarily hotel shoppers as they come to the site. Because we have an experience set in classic and we know what our clients were paying and, in some cases, we know how many bookings they were getting for the amount that they were paying, we can do a before and after and say, hey, there's still certainly room for our clients to bid up higher and still be just as profitable. And that gives us optimism to be able to pricing going up. Now in the true bid, prices could go up even higher. I have a harder time seeing how efficient we are vis-\u00e0-vis Google, the other major competitor for traffic. In terms of conversion, we've been at it for a long time. We had some meaningful conversion gains last year in our classic product. So I pretty much -- I have a lot of confidence that with the constant iteration that we're good at -- and really, I have to tip my hat to the engineering and product team right now and sales folks because they've just done an excellent job reclaiming a bunch of the loss that we've seen in the past quarter. And I have every reason to believe that we'll continue on that trajectory. The more we optimize, the harder it is to get the next percent or 2 of revenue gains. So it slows down a bit, which is why we've sort of set the expectation that it may take us the rest of the year to get back. And we'll talk again in 3 months, and I'll give you the update then as to how far we've come. But I don't -- it's hard for me to share anything more because I don't actually have the crystal ball that says how quick we can get there.","Operator","And our next question will be from Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So one for Julie. Julie, last quarter, you helped us size the amount of spending that you guys were allocating towards the off-line spend, and you kind of helped us back into what EBITDA growth would have been absent the expected investment. So I guess my question is, if you guys implement a test in a handful of markets in the U.S. and you don't see what you want to see -- because you guys are rigorous in terms of analytics and ROI -- so you don't see what you want to see, do you still go forward? Or do you turn back money to the bottom line? Do you scale back? I guess another way to put the question is, what are the contingency plans if you don't see a kind of traffic lift in ROI from the test that you're expecting right now? How should we think about the total spending? And could this be an upside to EBITDA for the year?","Julie M. B. Bradley","Sure. So I'll start off and then hand it over to Steve. So right now, all of our investments that we laid out at the beginning of the year is intact as we embark on what we think is a pretty exciting investment opportunity. I think it's going to take time to understand how TV impacts our business, and we will do that testing and measuring and retesting it and remeasuring. So I think at this early onset, we are staying put on our investment plans, that they're intact, but we'll see how it goes. I'll turn it over to Steve and see if he has any more color on this.","Stephen Kaufer","It is a great question that I think about frequently. So right, we've allocated the funds, and we intend to spend them. I think the odds of a \"Oh, fantastic, obvious ROI\" answer, great, let's go kick it up and talk about spending more is probably not going to happen. We -- I can't find folks that have that success record with TV. There's test and learn, there's try it, recover from the failure, move forward. The bigger question for us, given that some of this stuff may take a little while to deliver decent results on, is how quickly do we go international. I'm a believer in being able to have enough evidence that something is working before blowing it out on a global basis. And we had set a feasonable [ph] -- we had set what we thought was or what we believe to be a reasonable amount that will allow us both in the U.S. and to test some of the markets where perhaps we're not as well known. So the way I look at it, there's going to be lots of different things that we can test, and it'll be most interesting when it comes to our 2014 budgeting plan. Have we found enough things that we believe are working? But that's probably the better perspective to look at it rather than having a big impact on Q4.","Operator","And our next question is from Laura Martin from Needham & Company.","Laura A. Martin - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","One for Steve, one for Julie. So Julie, on yours, CapEx going from 4% to 6%, maybe you could give us some granularity on what's driving that. And Steve, I'm really interested in your acquisition strategy here. How do you think about the mix of international versus U.S.? And when you think about kind of where you want to go next specifically in the U.S., I'm really curious as to are you doing mobile? Are you doing more social integrations? How you think about the acquisition plan specifically in the U.S.","Julie M. B. Bradley","Sure. So on the CapEx side, it's really simple. We -- our traffic is growing at record rates right now, and we still are able to operate at a fairly small percentage of revenue of additional CapEx. And we are -- our assumption is that traffic growth rates are going to continue, and we are adding hardware and data center to support that. So that's really the backdrop between the slight raise from 4% to 6%.","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. Thanks for the question, Laura. So the 1 or 2 liners for the 4 acquisitions that we've done, TinyPost, we look at and say, \"Fun product,\" \"Already built,\" \"Mobile and social combined,\" and \"How cool it is to send a postcard when you're on the road,\" \"What a great way to share the TripAdvisor brand with all of your friends in a fun way.\" And we have a lot of travelers in market, so could be kind of really nice brand extension, not looking at it from a \"I'm going to charge you $1 a postcard.\" That's just not on the table right now. Niumba vacation rentals, clearly we're growing in Vacation Rentals. We've done 2 acquisitions. This is the third. And it expands our inventory footprint. Go back to the user perspective. And if you want to rent a place in Spain, we've just added a ton of great inventory to help you find the right place. We already have the infrastructure to -- we already have the traffic, we already have the infrastructure. So it just kind of fits in with where we're going. CruiseWise and Jetsetter, 2 acquisitions kind of led by other TripAdvisor Media Group businesses. And so, as running the whole media group, whenever any one of our businesses identifies a company out there that can make their core value proposition bigger, better, scalable or can extend them into a new market that's particularly interesting, these 2 aren't examples of that, but I would generally look favorably upon it because I like to let the -- most of the businesses run on their own. So that kind of explains the CruiseWise and the Jetsetter. The other way I -- the other lens through which I look at acquisitions is really furthering the core TripAdvisor offering globally. So we'd look at either something that adds lots of traffic in a market where we're not strong in, or something that adds technology or features to something that, in fact, we can roll out globally because, again, we're trying to leverage our traffic base, our content base, our reach, our membership, and those are pretty powerful assets that, if we brought a technology or a team, we can often make some nice hay with that. And then just sort of TripAdvisor for business as a separate group serving up subscriptions to hoteliers and other folks interested in the -- other businesses interested in reaching the eyeballs of travelers, that's kind of another leg of the company that could be up for acquisitions in the future simply because we have the sales force, we have the traffic and we have the travelers. So maybe, there are some additional products that would fit there. In almost all of the acquisitions that we do, talent plays a key role. So it's not that -- obviously, we innovate and we build a lot of stuff ourselves, but we're certainly not a company known for a \"not minted here\" [ph] situation as I think these folks would make it up to 15 or 20 acquisitions that we've done, something like that.","Operator","And our next question is from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs.","Heath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","When we look at what your -- the road map for moving to meta on mobile, and I realize we talked about meta a lot tonight, but as you look at the road map for that, any sense how meta on mobile is going to work for you relative to what you're seeing in the early stages of desktop? Is there at least a sense that sort of the monetization gap within a meta environment is different in some way from what you see in the current model you're using within mobile?","Stephen Kaufer","That's a really good question. The challenge on meta on mobile kind of in our mind moves to booking on mobile, and the meta experience is far and away better than the old Check Rates experience where you had a bunch of different tabs or windows. But on mobile, you're still left with, all right, it's $199 a night for this property, I click over and I'm left on, God forbid, a web page, hopefully a mobile web page, for going and entering all your information on that reservation site. On your phone, that's still a reasonably painful experience. So we think that there's more that can be done, especially on the phone, to make the experience better. For us at this point, it's a lower priority than the full desktop-tablet transition and the improvements that we get to make on tablets going forward with some of the brand refresh and some of the interface refresh that we're planning on. So I don't think there's interesting lessons to learn from the phone on to the desktop. And sorry, I guess I interpreted your question as to phone as opposed to tablet, but I tangented over to there being more that we think we can do on the phone over time.","Operator","And our next question is from Eric Sheridan from UBS.","Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Two quick ones. One, on the related party revenue from Expedia, it looks like, based on our math, that it was a nice bump up in the percentage of Expedia's overall marketing spend. Can we sort of drill down a little deeper on what you're seeing from the OTA partners and whether you might be taking budget of their overall marketing spend as you see the meta transition roll out? That's number one. And then number two, I guess, Julie, more of a guidance question on the display. Given the 14% growth in Q1, I'm sort of trying to understand what you saw in Q1 that might lead to sort of weakness in the middle part of the year so that, that beat on Q1 in display doesn't sort of roll through more for the full year number for display.","Stephen Kaufer","Okay, I'll start on that. So we don't think in the transition to meta that we're taking budget share from other folks at this point as it's a revenue-negative transition for us so far. So by the time we get to a breakeven, that's when we hope the new auction in the meta system would actually kick it into high gear, and we'll start being -- that, combined with the bidding tools, a better platform to go spend incrementally vis-\u00e0-vis Google, which is kind of really the only other competitor that we're fighting for budget share for. So I think, again, I'd be happy for an increased wallet share, but we don't see that dynamic happening yet. So the question on...","Julie M. B. Bradley","Yes, just on display, really we're just -- we're seeing strong traffic growth. Prices are up slightly. The real difference in the quarterly growth rates -- Q1 being strong, Q4, we expect, will be the strongest, which, of course, implies that we'll have a little bit of seasonal weakness in Q2 and Q3 -- just has to do more about the quarters that they were comping last year. And we had some -- we had a tough comp in the fourth quarter of last year, and we had an easier comp in the first quarter of last year and that's kind of how those year-over-year growth rates fall out.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Sena from Evercore Partners.","Kenneth Sena - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","The 10 basis points that you talked about being a headwind for mobile, can you say how much of that is just continued transition in terms of usage versus is there anything implied in that number as far as closing the monetization gap? And how much do you think you can close that monetization gap if you look further out?","Stephen Kaufer","So I'd say as we study the behavior of our phone traffic versus desktop, we see it kind of improving on the conversion level maybe because people are getting used to doing more things on the phone, maybe because we're attracting a different audience that's loyal to Trip and is now on the phone. We're just not sure. As phone continues to grow, mobile hotel shoppers continue to be a headwind. Let's be clear, if you do the math backwards, yes, our desktop and tablet hotel shoppers continue to grow at a very strong rate. So it may be cannibalizing some but kind of healthy on all fronts. I do expect our mobile monetization to improve as we essentially pay more attention to it and optimize the meta experience and the meta pricing on the phone. As more and more transactions happen on the phone, on our client sites, believe me, they start paying more attention to buying traffic that is on the phone. And so we're able to sell our phone traffic for more. We would predict. I'm tough to go on -- tough to get me to go on record on that because we haven't seen a lot of that yet. And just to be clear, we do price our leads differently when they come from the phone versus desktop\/traffic, so -- tablet. So the bidding -- when I talk about a partner bidding meta across 20 different points of sale or 50 different IP levels, times it by 2 because they're putting in a different bid price for the phone versus desktop.","Operator","And our next question is from Kevin Kopelman from Cowen & Company.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask about advertising expense. You saw nice leverage in sales and marketing this quarter. It does seem like a lot of that was related to the comp. But can you give us any color on the ad environment in paid search and your other main ad channels in Q1 and what you're seeing in Q2 to date?","Stephen Kaufer","So I'm not sure I can add much. I wouldn't say there's been any big shifts or big movements that I'm currently aware of in our existing paid channels when we're buying traffic. And on the client side, just by way of color, we're not seeing -- in our classic markets, we weren't seeing big price increases or decreases from our kind of standard clients. CPM, similar. I think it might have gone up a little bit, but not a big meaningful trend jump. We're all -- we've been -- pricing-wise, we've all been focused on the meta, and that just kind of disrupts any and all comps. And on the traffic acquisition side, which I think was the point of your question, I wouldn't really say any big changes in Q1.","Julie M. B. Bradley","Yes, I'd just also add that we're a little bit behind in hiring in sales and marketing. So that's part of the reason.","Stephen Kaufer","Fair enough.","Operator","Your next question is from Brian Fitzgerald from Jefferies.","Brian Patrick Fitzgerald - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of quick questions. Personalization and social were key areas of focus that you have discussed previously. Any specific metric or trends to highlight there coming out of the social sphere, engagement or conversion rates? And then the second real quick one, I don't know if you've touched upon it yet. You're showing good growth rates, accelerating growth rates out of EMEA. Any different trends for Europe versus the rest of EMEA there?","Stephen Kaufer","So I'd say on -- in the major countries in EMEA, we had seen some recovery. It's a little hard to say if it's macro or -- well, it was just so bad a year ago that we're now back to the new normal phrase. To the personalization, social, we have continued our efforts on social in a pretty big way. We're working on some things that are on the TripAdvisor side as well as in our Cities I Visited Facebook app. The partnership with Facebook continues to go great guns. More and more of our reviews are social-enabled, so they're seen and shareable on Facebook to your friends. And there's a consistently higher and higher chance that when you come to TripAdvisor, even if you're just instantly personalized because you happen to have Facebook open, you're going to see your friends have been on TripAdvisor, and you're going to see reviews and ratings from your friends. So it's a long build, if you will. It's a slow build in terms of the amount of reviews and content that we can share. But it's an incredible advantage that we now have that's growing like clockwork every month over every other player, because our view, and we're very public about it, is that being able to annotate the wisdom of the crowds with the wisdom of your friends is going to beat everyone else when it comes to the quality and the insight you get from reading reviews. And you can go to other major OTA sites and you can see plenty of reviews. You'll frequently see half a dozen reviews from us as well, and then you come to TripAdvisor and you see not only the incredible volume, but you see the ones from your friends or the -- or your friend of a friend. So that just kind of cements, yes, why should I bother reading the reviews anywhere else? Let me go to the source, TripAdvisor. So, true, I didn't mention it, didn't give it much airtime in my talking points, but it remains a dedicated focus of TripAdvisor, dedicated product team, dedicated engineering team, an ongoing effort. Personalization, I, in a sense, wish we had done more in -- year-to-date. We feel we have an incredible base of users that we can help make better recommendations for based upon friend activity, browsing history, all sorts of stuff that we have. But this was a prioritization call on my part to say, hey, we're going to slow that one down in order to assign as many as available resources on to the meta transition as we could. So we'd like to be able to report more growth there. We believe in it. We believe it's another incredible competitive advantage that TripAdvisor has over everyone else. We just have so much content and information about our users that we can make a better recommendation. But I fully acknowledge that we don't do a great job of it now, and, hopefully -- or not hopefully -- and you will see some more activity on the personalization front over the course of this year.","Operator","So ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer portion. I would now like to turn it back to Steve Kaufer, CEO, for closing remarks.","Stephen Kaufer","All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today.

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to TripAdvisor's Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Will Lyons. Please go ahead.","Will Lyons - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thanks, Sonia. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Steve Kaufer, our CEO; and Ernst Teunissen, our CFO. Last night, after market close, we distributed and filed our Q3 earnings release, we filed our 10-Q, and we made available our prepared remarks on our Investor Relations website located at ir.tripadvisor.com.","In the release, you will find reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures discussed on this call. You'll also find supplemental financial information, which includes certain non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, as well as other performance metrics.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that this call may contain estimates and other forward-looking statements that represent the company's view as of today, November 7, 2017.

Please refer to our earnings release and our filings with the SEC for information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","And with that, I'll pass the call over Steve.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thank you, Will. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call.","As we discussed in our prepared remarks last night, we continued to make progress on our long-term growth initiatives aimed at building more durable direct relationships with hotel shoppers on our platform. Reallocating marketing dollars to brand building channels has contributed to softer topline results, but we believe this is the best path towards driving profitable revenue growth over the long-term.","In Non-Hotels, strong momentum continues, particularly in Attractions and Restaurants, products that deepen traveler engagement with our platform. We are investing to further broaden our marketplace, to grow bookable supply, and to improve the product experience, helping more travelers throughout more moments of every trip.","In both segments, we have a lot more work to do, but we play the long game and remain focused on building for the long-term.","Ernst?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Reigniting our near-term hotel revenue growth has proven more challenging than we expected this quarter and this year. But our product and marketing initiatives continue to deliver early positive signs, and we are optimizing our marketing mix for maximum long-term benefit.","Our television advertising investment was the primary driver of Q3 operating expense growth year-over-year. The prudent expense management, as well as continued strength in our Non-Hotel segment, has enabled us to maintain our 2017 adjusted EBITDA expectations.","Across our business, we will continue to strike an appropriate balance between growth and profitability as we aim for long-term shareholder value creation.","With that, we'll open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question. Two, if I can. First, in the prepared remarks, you guys had said hotel shopper growth is flattish in October. So, just wondering, if mobile continued to hover around say the mid-20%s range, it would imply desktop shopper growth falling double-digits into October. Is that the right way to think about it?","And then second one. On the Non-Hotel side, can you give us some color on the cost structure to the business here, relative maybe to the core business? Is it more advertising intensive, historically? And we ask because obviously you're seeing a nice margin expansion. Some of it's driven by declining OpEx year-over-year, so trying to get a sense for what the cost structure looks like, where it may have bottomed out, such that future EBITDA will be more driven by topline growth on that side? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Hi, Lloyd. Good morning. The mobile question, yes, we did see deceleration. Actually, throughout Q3 and in October, we saw flattish overall shopper growth. It is a continuation of relative out-performance of mobile shopper growth and under-performance of desktop shopper growth. So that's a trend that continues and is underlying that overall trend.","In terms of your second question, and sort of cost structure between Hotel and Non-Hotel. So, what we see is that the cost structure is quite comparable in terms of the line items of sales and marketing, tech and content, and general and admin, in terms of structure of the P&L, so not that much different. What we've seen this year is skill benefits in the Non-Hotel business. We're growing. We're particularly growing faster on our TripAdvisor platforms for Attractions, for instance, but also for Vacation Rentals, which has allowed us to be more efficient with our marketing spend this year compared to other years, and it's overall scale benefits actually that is driving most of the margin expansion in that segment this year.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC","Oh, hey, thanks, and good morning. Can you give us \u2013 you gave a lot of really good color on the click-based and transaction-based revenue. Can you give us more color on what Q4 or the full-year is looking like for Non-Hotel and perhaps some of the other hotel lines to get to that full-year new revenue guidance for low single-digits growth? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes, hi, Kevin. The other lines see a continuation of trends more or less. The Non-Hotel sees into Q4 very similar growth trends as we've seen throughout the year. Early in the year, we said we would expect similar growth in 2017 as we did in 2016. That still holds. So not much movement in other lines from Q3, Q4 in terms of relative growth rate. It's really the click-based and transaction that's the big difference.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then just one follow-up on that. It looks like very easy comp in \u2013 I think other hotel revenue. Is that, in fact, an easy comp, or what does that look like?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah. So, we've seen in the other hotel revenue, we've seen deceleration, negative growth rates in the first half. We're happy to see that turnaround in Q3 again. And the trend into Q4 will be \u2013 is likely not to be too dissimilar from Q3.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then just one final big picture question. As you plan for 2018, how are you \u2013 what are you balancing as you figure out what an appropriate level of growth and profit is? And how should we be thinking about it?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes, as we think about 2018, clearly on the topline side, as we highlighted in our prepared remarks, we'll enter 2018 with the headwinds that we've seen on the topline in our core auction that we have described. So that will be a headwind moving into the new year.","We continue to think about our marketing budget as an increase of TV spend, but a gradual increase of TV spend is next year, but a reallocation of less efficient paid marketing spend as well. So over and over, we're going to balance the two aspects of our marketing mix. And then overall, we'll take a very prudent look at our other expenses as well in the Hotel segment.","In Non-Hotel, we expect continued progress both on top and bottom and we'll continue to grow that business as we have over the last quarters and years.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thanks, Ernst.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Deepak Mathivanan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Two questions for me. So first, mobile monetization continues to improve well. I think it's up 12% this quarter, while desktop is why there's been a sharp decline. Can you elaborate the trends that's driving mobile versus desktop monetization, particularly considering the partner spend adjustments?","And then second one, just to elaborate a little bit \u2013 maybe you can elaborate a little bit on marketing budget. You noted that you pulled back from certain less efficient channels. How should we think about the scope of that going forward in 2018? Perhaps you can maybe call out what specific channels those are as well. Thanks a lot.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes, hi Deepak. To start with the mobile monetization, indeed, again year-on-year, RPS growth on mobile monetization \u2013 the partner bid-downs did have impact on mobile as well, but we were still able to grow revenue per shopper year-over-year. And the cause of that is the continued focus from our product teams on mobile and mobile monetization. It's been a big push for us in parallel to all the other initiatives that we ever had gone on.","Particularly on mobile web, we've seen very impressive wins. As you know, in Q2, we kicked off a new site experience, which was across desktop and mobile, and we're happy to have seen very nice wins on the mobile side. On the marketing budget and how we have seen it evolved, can you restate the question? I don't have the full question.","Deepak Mathivanan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, sure. I was trying to figure out what channels you have pulled back and how should we think about the scope of the program going forward in 2018. I know you called out certain less efficient channels. I was wondering if it's SEM-related or re-targeting or a combination of both?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes, thank you. Thanks for specifying. It's across a number of different channels, so it's not a specific channel that we've identified. We've become a little bit more sophisticated in the attribution of our different channels to the downstream booking. We have, as you know, managed a whole portfolio of performance-based marketing more or less to breakeven, but if you dig deeper, there are some less efficient spend across multiple channels.","And so we've been pulling back on that versus what we had planned initially in the year, which is a further impact on our revenue growth. We do believe there is more scope for efficiency optimization in our paid marketing. We continue to do that, we are continuing doing that in Q4, and going into the next year, we do see further scope for more efficiency on the performance-based channel.","Deepak Mathivanan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Ernst.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Naved Khan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is now open.","Naved Khan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you very much. I had a couple of questions. Just wanted to clarify this, but the fact that you pulled back on some of the performance ad channels. Is that having a more pronounced effect on desktop traffic versus mobile? And then I had a follow-up.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes, hi, Naved. Good morning. It indeed has had a disproportionate effect on desktop. Our ability to spend on performance-based marketing is a direct function of the revenue per shopper that we can achieve. And as we discussed, we saw pressure on revenue per shopper in desktop, but we were able to increase revenue per shopper on mobile. So the relative impact has been more significant on desktop.","Naved Khan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then just on the \u2013 can you just comment on the dynamics between the fact that your partners might be looking for higher ROI or they might have moved their ROI targets when they advertise with you. And at the same time, you are able to improve some of the monetization on mobile hotel shopper? What's the interplay between the two in terms of when advertisers are bidding, with different targets, and when you're also solving for increasing monetization?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah, being able to improve monetization is of course a plus. It allows us to lean into paid marketing, be more competitive either on Google or with re-targeting. And so, despite partner bid-downs, our improvements there allow us to expand marketing spend on mobile.","Naved Khan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May of Citi. Your line is now open.","Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. In terms of \u2013 sorry if these have been addressed already, but in terms of the advertiser bid-downs, are there any signs of source (14:28) stability there, or are there potential for those to keep adjusting?","And then will the decrease in revenue per shopper in any way impact your thinking about your marketing plans and increase in marketing spend, including TV going forward? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Hi, Mark, good morning. This is Steve. With regard to the bid-downs, we've run this auction for so many years. There's always a fair amount of volatility month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter.","In this particular case, I think you've seen some of our partners' comments on increasing marketing efficiencies, and they don't seem to be publicly commenting on an ever-declining direction; but rather, they've tightened their efficiency to afford to do some other things, which, presumably, makes sense for their business model. So, as we have always done, we take into account the new landscape, and we forecast our future plans based upon a status quo of the current bid levels.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","To your second question, Mark, revenue per shopper and the impacts on marketing, broadly defined \u2013 so a few things I'd like to highlight. So, our revenue per shopper year-on-year was negative 11%. We bid separately for traffic on desktop and on mobile. The total was down 11%. Mobile RPS was up. Desktop was down, but actually less down than the 11%. So, the 11% is, to a significant degree, also driven by the mix shift between the lower monetizing mobile traffic.","So, in the meantime, we are improving our product quite significantly. One of the things that we called out is that, if we look at, in the quarter, the year-on-year performance of just the economic value the underlying leads bring that we provide to our partners, that has been improving. So, the decline that we've seen on desktop revenue per shopper has been largely driven by these partner bid-downs. So, while these partner bid-downs have happened, we've also made significant strides in positive development.","And as we think about our marketing budget, the performance-based marketing budget; and to some extent, the TV budget as well, as we look at ROAS, ROAS is going to be impacted by our projections for revenue per shopper.","And our projections for revenue per shopper are a function of what we expect the external environment does, obviously how our partners behave, but also what we believe we can improve over time, in terms of the underlying economic value of our shoppers.","Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey, good morning. I have a fairly high-level questions. I think parts of this really have been asked already in different ways. And it may be hard for you to say, but what do you think changed in how your major advertising partners are thinking about the metasearch channel as a source of traffic? Did the ROI or conversion of the traffic that meta provides worsen, or is that their ROI thresholds are higher than they were in the past?","And then, other than meta-channel sources finding ways to deliver higher converting traffic, what could alter that trend? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure, Mike. Thanks. This is Steve. I would not kind of lump all of our partners into the ones that are currently looking for a higher ROI. And the partners that I have had the chance to speak to are all quite appreciative and interested in buying more and more traffic on the part of TripAdvisor.","So, I think we are an excellent partner for our hotel in OTA clients. We provide a very flexible bid mechanism. A flexible downstream kind of conversion funnel for them. And when we are able to measure the quality of the clicks that we send down to our partners, they have become more effective. In other words, they convert better than they did before, and that's direct work on our side to better qualify the traveler to be ready to book this hotel before we send them downstream to a hotel or an OTA.","So, we're kind of doing all the things that we can on our side to make ourselves a better partner. And I don't detect any reluctance on the part of partner hotels or OTAs to invest in the meta-channel in general.","And so, again, you should of course be asking them, but when it comes to the overall health of meta as a channel, it still serves a very important function for travelers, and OTAs and hotels still recognize that it's a very important channel for them to tap into the type of demand that we bring to the table.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Patterson of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. In the prepared remarks, you mentioned that Hotel segment expenses were effectively flat, ex-TV advertising? How do you think about the trade-off between revenue growth and profitability? Do you worry that you're under-investing in tech and content and perhaps slowing the rate of innovation?","And then, secondly, on Vacation Rentals. The OTAs are stepping up their investment, and Airbnb continues to execute well. How does that shape your strategy in the segment going forward? Why not apply a meta-model to Vacation Rental, and potentially capture some of that advertising budget of the OTAs and Airbnb? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Hey, Justin. This is Ernst. Indeed, year-on-year in the third quarter, our expenses in Hotel were flat, other than for the additional TV expenditure. We're striking a balance between, on the one hand, investing enough for growth. But on the other hand, adjust to the headwinds that we are encountering. So, we're actively striking that balance between revenue growth and EBITDA.","We don't believe we are under-investing in tech and content. If you look at what we've been doing over the last year, we've made some substantial investments in the product, both on desktop and on mobile, to get ready for our brand campaign, and our focus on price comparison as a key value proposition for our users, and on mobile just to make sure that we keep improving that monetization. So, we believe we have an appropriate level of investment there, and we're balancing future expense growth against our bottom line objectives as well.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","This is Steve. I'll take the second question on Vacation Rentals. So, from our perspective, we're really aiming to make sure that that alternative lodging category is well represented on TripAdvisor. So, we have about 800,000 properties. That's a pretty darn good mix. Having said that, of course, we're open to change as well. We'd love to have even more than that, and more different types available globally.","To the question of, why not a meta? I'm not sure that consumers are looking for the price comparison feature within a particular property, more than the ability to find the widest range of properties. And that's why we do continue to grow our supply, while making sure everything that's on our site is of high quality.","So, again, I think it's fair to say that it's important for our travelers. It doesn't have to be, and we're making no claims that we will become bigger than some of the other guys. But it does aid, clearly, our travelers' desire to have that alternative lodging choice on our site.","Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Thank you, Ernst. Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jed Kelly of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk to some of the engagement trends that you believe are benefiting from television advertising, in terms of customer data, such as store credit cards or the hotel shopper trends?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. This is Steve. I mean, the best things we see from the TV ad relate to how many people are searching for TripAdvisor. When they come to TripAdvisor, how we see their behavior being more what we're looking for than kind of our on-average customer. So, when they come and they've seen the TV ad, they're more likely to book, they're more likely to sort of go through the hotel shopping experience and actually consummate the transaction, either on TripAdvisor or downstream on our clients' sites.","So, the goal, to remind folks about the TV, was really to present TripAdvisor as a place where not only can you read reviews, but you can do your price-comparison research, and understand how TripAdvisor can save you money. Not, to the specific of your question, to help us generate more instant bookings whereby we might be able to have a credit card, but to really change the perception. So, I couldn't honestly tell you right now whether we are generating more saved credit cards or something like that from the TV campaign, because that really wasn't the target of our branding exercise.","Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nat Schindler of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Nathaniel Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, hi. You obviously have two large OTA partners who are your principal revenue source in the click-based revenue business. And from the discussion with you, and then discussion with a competitor, it's pretty clear that one of them has changed their philosophy on ROI. How does that affect the other?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. This is Steve, Nat. We run an auction. There's two big players up there. With the two big players, of course, there are several brands to compete there. When any one player bids down, by mathematical definition, share shifts to the other players in the auction. I can't be telling you anything you don't know.","Nathaniel Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Not just, though, on share. How does it affect their behavior? Are they lowering their bids? Do they follow bids lower or do they just simply get more share at the same bid?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","You'd have to look kind of market-by-market. What I'm trying to say \u2013 when a single player changes their bids, it's in aggregate. So, it's somewhat difficult for another partner to know exactly what they can and cannot do in response. So, you should think of it as share shift, yes. But I wouldn't think of necessarily a big corresponding change on the part of the other client.","Nathaniel Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just one other clarification, you mentioned that it's individual brands within these companies. Is the partner that has changed their ROI philosophy \u2013 are they doing it across all their brands, at the corporate level, or are they doing it on a specific brand in a specific region?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah, I appreciate the question, but we really aren't able to talk about specific brands in our discussions.","Nathaniel Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Bieber of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I was hoping you could help us size the components of the Non-Hotel business. Obviously, there's Vacation Rental, Restaurants and Attractions in there. Can you just give us some context for the relative side of those businesses and growth rates?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes, in terms of growth rates, clearly, the faster growers are Attractions and Restaurants. So, in terms of growth, they're driving the growth in the segment. In terms of relative sizes, I don't want to be too specific in breaking it out, because we haven't broken it out, but Attractions is the largest of the three components with the other two smaller. But that's the order of magnitude, but I'm not going to go in more detail in breaking out as a percentage.","Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, guys. We want to know what type of dynamic if there's anything notable to call out with respect to conversion from Non-Hotel from Hotel. Are you seeing any uplift or tailwinds in the Non-Hotel area where branded campaigns are running?","And then a follow-up on Non-Hotel type of inventory, how do you feel about the breadth and depth of what you have there, your offering there, and then the rate at which you're adding more inventory, if you will, there?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thanks, Brian. This is Steve. The TV campaign is very much focused around educating folks on price comparison around hotels. Looking at a conversion lift in the Non-Hotel category from the additional brand awareness, next to impossible for us to tell, in part because those components on TripAdvisor are growing so strong all by themselves. So, you just have a lot of goodness happening in that Attraction, Restaurant category.","In terms of Non-Hotel inventory trends, we continue to grow both on Restaurants and Attractions in particular. And Attractions, the bookable products up 30-plus percent year-on-year. The overall Attractions listing growing as well. And when you look back a couple of years, the bookable supply is up 5X or something.","So the marketplace concept has really worked for us. We continue to grow in all regions of the world, and we love it. It's the classic marketplace model where as we add more to the supply match to the TripAdvisor demand that we already have, it continues to grow.","I think our TripAdvisor-sourced bookings for the Attraction category was up 100% year-on-year in Q3. So, we're just seeing really nice signs of that whole trip lifecycle coming together, and you see that in the numbers in that other hotel business growth.","So, Ernst, do you want to add anything? I think we're good there. Thanks.","Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. And I am showing no further question at this time. Now, it's my pleasure to hand the conference back over to Mr. Stephen Kaufer, Chief Executive Officer, for some closing comments or remarks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","All right. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining the call. I want to thank our employees around the globe for their continued hard work, and we look forward to updating everyone next quarter. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to TripAdvisor's Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Will Lyons. Please go ahead.","Will Lyons - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Steve Kaufer, our CEO, and Ernst Teunissen, our CFO. Last night, after market close, we distributed and filed our Q1 earnings release. We filed our 10-Q, and we made available our prepared remarks on our Investor Relations website, located at ir.tripadvisor.com.","In the release, you will find reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures discussed on this call. Also, our IR site contains a supplemental file information document, which includes certain non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call as well as other performance metrics. Instead of reading our prepared remarks on this call, Steve will jump into a couple of thoughts, and then we'll jump right into Q&A.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that this call may contain estimates and other forward-looking statements that represent the company's view as of today, May 10, 2017. TripAdvisor disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. Please refer to our earnings release and our filings with the SEC for information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","And, with that, I'll pass the call over to Steve.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thank you, Will, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. Hopefully, you've had a chance to read our prepared remarks that we published last night after market close.","I'll summarize by saying 2017 is off to a productive start. In Hotels, we're rapidly aligning products, supply and marketing, as we drive towards long-term growth and profitability. In a few weeks, we will rollout our streamlined hotel shopping experience and, soon thereafter, we'll launch our new brand advertising campaign, leveraging our strong global brand to build user awareness at TripAdvisor as a great place to find the lowest prices when you are ready to book.","In Non-Hotels, our continued strong demand growth and supply investments are really starting to pay off. And while focus remains on top-line growth, this segment is already beginning to exhibit attractive profit potential. We are addressing large growth opportunities ahead and making great progress building end-to-end products that travelers love, a bigger and better platform for advertisers and a bigger and better business over the long term.","Ernst?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We saw strong growth recovery, as the first quarter consolidated total revenue growth improved to 6% year-over-year, or 7% in constant currency. This revenue growth also improved from our fourth quarter results, driven by improvements in our TripAdvisor-branded click-based and transaction business.","We are encouraged by the significant recovery we saw in this click-based and transaction revenue growth over the past few quarters and the continued strong growth of our Non-Hotel segment. Notably, we reiterate our revenue and adjusted EBITDA outlook, now inclusive of our brand advertising investment. We are able to maintain this outlook by re-allocating some less-efficient online marketing dollars, as well as expected profit favorability in our Non-Hotel segment towards our brand advertising.","With that, we'll now open the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. Our first question will come from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed.","Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks guys. Nice job on the quarter. Steve, I guess, the first question is just can we get a little more color on what's driving the improvement in revenue per shopper in the U.S. market? Is it coverage? Is it better competition in the auction? Any color there would be helpful. And then, can you also talk about overall engagement? As you've been making these changes to the mobile experience and as you see hotel shopper growth pick back up, what's happening with engagement, meaning is session frequency or visits per hotel shopper also going up? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. So with regard to our revenue per shopper growth in the U.S., the biggest factor is certainly going to be the lapping of instant book. We have made a big bet in that category, built a really nice product. But it did have some dilutive effects. So now, we're at a really good spot where we have turned the team towards the regular optimization efforts that we normally go through and we're seeing results. Simultaneously as we indicated, we are working on our new shopping experience. And any time that we focus on delivering a better overall experience, we would look to one of the measurements being an increased revenue per shopper.","When it comes to mobile, we've certainly seen meaningful growth aligned with the industry as users tip over to be using mobile apps and web. And we've seen, on our own side, an improved revenue per session from users using our mobile app. I don't have specific numbers I can share in terms of increased engagement to your specific question, but suffice to say, more and more users, more and more of the time, are using our apps for, not only hotel shopping, but the full trip.","Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. If I can ask one more follow-up for Ernst on the Non-Hotel segment, so you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you expect positive EBITDA for 2017. So can you talk about like where that margin might be exiting 2017 and remind us again what the longer-term margin profile for Non-Hotel looks like? Thank you.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yeah. We've always described this as a multi-year process, in which we would initially invest in the Non-Hotel segment and then gradually turn it to profitability, as we saw more scale in the business. We've been focused on building scale. This is the year where we're seeing some of that building scale come to fruition in terms of leverage on the bottom line. And, as we say, we expect this Non-Hotel segment in aggregate to be EBITDA positive, which we think is a great mid-point in our journey.","As we go forward, we expect our margins in the longer run to be robust and attractive. We're not managing to a particular margin. We continue to see this business as a growth and investment business. But this year, we are going to see that profitability come through and a little faster than we even thought three months ago. The first quarter has seen very robust results on the top-line versus our expectations, but also on the bottom-line versus our expectation. We're seeing some efficiencies come through in this business. So, positive EBITDA for the year and a strong outlook for the future.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","To add just a tiny bit of additional color to that, we're pleased to note that in our attractions business, specifically the TripAdvisor as the demand channel, is growing faster than we had anticipated. And that was, of course, one of the big pieces of synergy that we were looking for when picking up the Viator business and all of that supply, how do we better monetize all of the demand that's already sitting on TripAdvisor? And so on the TripPlatform, the demand continues to grow quite quickly, and we're able to merchandise it better, having all the great Viator supply at our fingertips.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two also around the marketing theme. In decommissioning inefficient spend and redeploying that money into brand advertising, I'm curious what you think that does for a return on your marketing dollars long term for the business. That will be number one. And number two, as you do sort of decommission inefficient spend and redeploy it into brand, anything we should be aware of in the quarter-to-quarter cadence of marketing that might buck some of the usual seasonality trends of marketing. Thanks so much for the color.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thank you, Eric. In terms of the long-term efficiency profile of our paid-marketing spend, we expect from TV to create much more lifetime value of users that we acquire and influence from TV than we are going to be able to get with online marketing. And so with our online marketing, we have managed to, pretty short-term, roughly breakeven as a channel, the ongoing benefit is more limited and difficult to prove. With TV, with a real shift of brand perception as TripAdvisor from a place just to use for planning, to use for planning plus price comparison and booking, we can get much more lasting impact on our user group. And therefore, over time, that should actually benefit our marketing efficiency profile. In terms of the seasonality of marketing spend cadence, not so much. I mean the marketing will still be aligned very much to the seasonality of the business, which doesn't change by doing advertising.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed.","Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. I had two questions somewhat related, it kind of has to do with the near-term risks. You're going to be reallocating a pretty significant amount of your online marketing spend, how confident are you that you kind of have your head around the negative impact that that's going to have to the top-line, at least in the near term? And then you will be changing your UI, it sounds like as well, how confident are you around modeling the short-term potential negative impacts? And I guess, the question there will be, also what do you see as some of the near-term potential negative impacts from the UI change? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Okay. This is Ernst. I'll take the first question on the marketing, and Steve will take the product question. It is true that if we reallocate marketing dollars from online to TV is you get a positive impact in revenue on TV and potentially a negative impact on online. We have done quite a bit of work over the last three months in studying the different markets that we're going to go in with TV, studying our historical patterns of impact of TV that we have found. And although there is some volatility around the results there, we feel good about the projections that we are making and good about reiterating this double-digit growth this year on our transaction-based business for TripAdvisor. Steve you got...","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes. And with regard to the user interface, we are fortunate that this is the type of change that's mostly internal to TripAdvisor. It's not requiring a lot of assistance or behavior change on the part of our clients. So, we're in control over the testing methodology, the roll-out. You can see some of the changes already on the site, some of the changes already on the app, basically depending, if you get lucky enough to see it. But all of that goes into our testing and how we are able to gain confidence that is in fact revenue neutral or revenue positive, as we move to roll-out. I'm not saying we wouldn't roll out completely if we were up or down by a little bit, but we do have a lot of capabilities and are experiencing this day-to-day in tuning and tweaking the design so that it delivers on not only a better experience, but the revenue expectations that we have in our plan.","Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. In the script, you guys mentioned that absolute U.S. revenue per hotel shopper has fully recovered to levels to prior to instant book launch. It looked like by our math that the desktop rev per shopper still about 20% off the highs. Is the delta just international, and is that following a similar path to the U.S. in terms of improvement? And then just following up on some of the TV questions, it's always a challenge to change user behavior. And you guys have been working at it on the IP side. I guess what is it about the new campaign and\/or the new page that makes you feel more confident you can really get users to come back closer to time of purchase? Is there anything just from the tests you've seen in the new page design that gives you that incremental confidence? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Lloyd, I'll take the first one, and Steve will take the second. The comment about RPS being back to 2014 levels, pertain to the U.S. and so we have seen that in the U.S. Internationally, we have not yet seen that. And so that was a clarification I want to make on that point.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And in terms of TV changing behavior, there are many examples out there where a brand in a category comes up with, you could call it, line extension if you want. So, we all think back to Amazon that started at books and now did books and music, and books, music and of course, now they do everything, and they were able to do that because they have positioned themselves as a shopping site. Well, TripAdvisor is a travel site. You come to plan your trip. So, we have the credibility to be able to play in a number of different aspects in that travel planning, but we wouldn't be able to sell you a pair of shoes, that's kind of not what people associate TripAdvisor.","So we come from a strength, reviews, as Amazon had come from a strength, books, but it's well within what users are using the site for to extend it to something else, and in our case, moving into that price comparison. So, we have a large portion of our current audience and have, for the past decade, come to TripAdvisor, read reviews and move into our price comparison engine and then click off to our partners or use instant book to book. So that's an already established behavior pattern for a large portion of our users.","Our challenge isn't, hey, is that even possible? Will users do that sort of thing? They do. It's a huge business for us. The question is, can a TV campaign accelerate the move of the people who don't currently use us for that to join sort of the crowd that does. And a lot of people, when we ask will say, well, yes, I use it for reviews. I didn't know that you have price comparison. And, of course, I hear that and I think, how could you miss that on our site? Oh my goodness, it's plastered all over the place. But you have to accept what users are telling you.","When we go on TV and we talk very clearly about price comparison, find the lowest price, help save you some money as a traveler. And we repeat that on the TV ad numerous times, we hope to educate that individual that the site that they already know and love can now be used for this new part of the hotel shopping experience, which they are already on TripAdvisor for. So we don't view it as a big leap or a big change. And when we looked at our last TV campaign, it was focused less around the benefit of comparing prices and more teaching about teaching users specifically that they can now book on TripAdvisor.","So we've tweaked that message. We'll be back out to the marketplace at a heavier weight with a more streamlined user experience that's focused around that hotel shopping. Think of it as less distractions on the page, more point how can we help you save some money in your shopping experience, how can we give you the best value for the hotel that you're looking for, not just the highest rated, but the best rated in your price point, those sorts of things. And we're giving ourselves time to make that message sink in through things like TV and our other online campaigns. So, I view our past TV as very instructive useful lessons to get us to where we are now, but we have a very compelling plan to achieve these objectives that we have in front of us now.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Makes sense. Thanks a lot, Steve.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Justin Patterson with Raymond James. Please proceed.","Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. Steve, I know in the past you've often referred to TripAdvisor as being indifferent between meta and instant booking. With the new hotel shopping experience rolling out, could you just characterize what if anything has changed within there? And then, secondly, one for Ernst. On click-based transaction revenue, you mentioned that international growth rates are still significantly lagging due to the constant currency. You obviously had a very strong quarter with the U.S. How should we think about the cadence of improvement in that international growth rate? And is there any reason that that should improve at a different rate than the U.S.? Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Great. Justin, I'll take the first part. So we look at meta and IB as two different methods to allow the user to find and book the hotel that they want. They are on our site. They're getting the best value that they can in the sort. They're looking at the photos, reading the reviews, building the confidence that they are getting the right spot, the right hotel.","Now, the next thing the consumer absolutely needs is to get the best deal on that hotel. And so part of the new shopping experience helps pull people down that funnel of putting in your dates and actually getting to see our prices, and noting that we've scoured the web and found you a great price. The thing that's not new in this quarter or in this redesign is where instant book fits into that mix, because we have been talking for several quarters about instant booking earning its position in our hotel shopping experience so that we put it in front of users when we think they are most likely to use it, either for price, because instant book might have the best price or convenience, particularly on the phone, if it's something you've used before.","So, we want to build that great shopping experience. Instant booking is a clear tool that help us do that and is a way that we can get better pricing in front of our consumers and make it more convenient, especially on the phone. But as we look forward in 2017-2018, if instant book, if as some people come to think, well, instant book is not as prominent as it once was, and that's because our customers are telling us they are indifferent as to whether they are choosing to use it versus something else, and that's okay with us, hence the comment on indifferent. We want to do what's best for our travelers, and we believe instant book plays a key role in that, though not as big a role as we had anticipated a couple of years ago.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And then, Justin, your question about the click-based revenue and the international component of that. So, the U.S. is roughly half of our revenues and the other half is outside of the U.S. The UK is our largest market, but it's a long tail of many, many markets internationally. Part of the differential in growth rates is attributable to timing in IB and lapping of IB, but that's not the full story. Currency is one of the factors, if you compare, for instance, the pound, the UK being our largest non-U.S. market a year ago versus today. And then the mobile shift has tended to happen faster outside of the U.S. than in the U.S.","And then there are many market-by-market differences. But generally, the overall market, the robustness of our auction, the level of competition is more favorable in the U.S. than in many places outside of the U.S. And so our anticipation is that the U.S. will remain the pace car in terms of growth in the foreseeable future that we believe that in the long-term, international markets can be robust growers for us. Two, that the pattern of growth recovery is likely to be a little slower than we've seen in the U.S. and therefore, lag the U.S. more than just the lagging of the IB roll-out.","Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey. Good morning. I have two questions please. First, how much of the ability to maintain your EBITDA guidance for the year is a result of the reallocation of marketing funds versus the better profitability in the Non-Hotel segment? I'd assume it's nearly all the reallocation of marketing dollars. But, first of all, is that correct? And then, second, I guess, following the previous question, assuming IB continues to be less of a focus, how do you envision navigating the challenge of the handoff problem for mobile that IB was meant to help or is that handoff, for instance, maybe just not a significant of an issue as you previously perceived it to be as you see the mobile mix grow? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thank you, Mike. We're not breaking down in more detail where the EBITDA favorability comes from to offset the TV unfavorability. But we called out these two factors for a reason. They are both meaningful contributors to that. And so it's not only one or the other, we called these two out because they are both relevant.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And with respect to instant book on the phone, if you look back, I keep talking about building the great shopping experience for hotel shoppers on the phone. And there is a click-off model that works quite well for us and others. But there's certainly a wonderful convenience of being able to essentially buy it with a single click, as sites like Amazon have shown. We don't see a reason why we won't be able to get there in the Hotel space. And to do that, you need something that kind of looks like instant book or something pretty close.","So, if we fast-forward to the time when instant book really does have the best pricing available on the web, it's kind of matched the lowest price from anywhere, there is going to be in our prediction a set of travelers who love the TripAdvisor hotel shopping experience, have put in their credit cards and have now formed a habit, where they are a frequent repeat user of our app, because it's just simpler and you always get the lowest price. We're not forcing that on people, to be clear right now, but we see that as a wonderful endgame as the world moves to mobile. And if you're using us for price comparison, there isn't an obvious benefit of clicking out versus continuing your purchase on our site, unless someone else gives you the better price. And that's the challenge for the instant book team is always making sure that piece of the product has the best price. When we do that, we'll earn more than our fair share, more convenience. Where we don't, our business funnel says, will help the customer save the dollar by clicking them off to whoever does have the lowest price.","Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Perry Gold with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed.","Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. Can you provide any more color on the recently announced Grubhub deal? How broadly will it be rolled out on TripAdvisor? How will it be promoted? And how should we think about the revenue opportunity longer term? Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. So as you know, we have a massive number of restaurants on the site globally. And folks, when they are looking for that place to eat, sometimes want to make a reservation, if it's a restaurant that takes reservations electronically, often want to read the reviews, look at the photos and sometimes want to do take-out, order the food delivery. Grubhub is a great partner. It covers many cities, certainly not all cities in the world, and presuming that works well for us, you'd expect to see additional food delivery platforms coming online. I'd caution against viewing that as a move-the-needle revenue opportunity for us as our traffic certainly tends to be a reasonable mix of tourists and locals, and tourists are going to be less likely to use a food delivery service, but based upon the scale of our restaurant space, it's kind of yet another product in the mix.","Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Kopelman with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC","Hi. Thanks a lot. Could you give us any color on what you were seeing in April, especially with the Easter timing comp? And then on that, you also advised against extrapolating Q1 RPS growth into Q2. Can you give any more color on why you're more cautious on that? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes. Thanks, Kevin. In our prepared remarks, we didn't call out any specific comments about April, but we did comment more broadly about extrapolation from Q1 into Q2 as you point out. And we caution against extrapolating some of the graphs that we put into our prepared remarks into Q2. Q1, as we said in the prepared remarks as well, was a quarter where the year-on-year comps for our paid marketing investment were relatively favorable. So we saw an ability to significantly grow our paid revenue line in Q1, which may not translate directly into Q2.","And I'll make the point more generally, as some of these graphs that we put in, RPS and shoppers, if you look at the last few quarters, you could be tempted just to draw a straight line through some of those curves, and I just want to make sure of that. Although we have reiterated our expectation that we'll have double-digit growth in the click-based line this year and we feel very good about where we are and we feel good about our outlook there, the quarter-to-quarter progression may be not as smooth as some of the graphs have shown so far.","Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. Thanks, Ernst.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.","Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. On capital allocation, you continue to churn out a decent amount of free cash flow and had a second consecutive quarter of decent buyback activity. Can you share how you're managing buybacks versus acquisitions versus investing for growth just given your comments around the long-term outlook for the business and where the stock is currently trading, would it make sense to be even more aggressive around the buybacks?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Jed. Indeed, we put $150 million to work in Q1 for share repurchases at an average price of $42.49. And I also want to underline what you said in your opening statement is that we are indeed generating significant cash flows just from operations. As we think about allocation, the areas of where we could invest outside of the business, outside the operations of the business is M&A, as evidenced in the last few years, in acquisitions that we've made like Viator, like the TheFork, LaFourchette, last year we made a number of smaller investments but a number of investments there as well. And we'll continue to look at opportunities that may present itself in the M&A space.","And then there's share repurchase as an opportunity as well. And as you say, we clearly, in 2016 and in the first quarter of 2017, have seen an opportunity to buy back some of our shares. The program is reviewed by the board from time to time. In January, the board approved refreshing the $250 million allocation that we had for share repurchases. And we have a 10b5 program in place with different triggers that we don't want to go into detail but they resulted in that purchase in Q1 and from time to time will allow us to benefit from periods where we believe our share price is attractive as an acquisition of ourselves, of our own stock.","Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Can you guys help us understand how much of the recovery and a return to the pre-IB monetization levels that you're seeing in the U.S. is coming from optimizing on instant book versus shifting back to meta? And then also just wanted to follow up on mobile. Can you just talk about what the mobile to desktop monetization gap is here currently and your comments on extrapolating the same rationale, Ernst, that you mentioned a few minutes ago? Thanks.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes. So the U.S., I think it's a little bit difficult to untangle after so many years of how much of the RPS is this or the other. I do want to comment is we've made continuous improvements on our revenue per shopper on desktop and in mobile. And in the U.S., we have been able to do that, and we've been making continuous improvements on instant booking. We said a few quarters ago already that in the U.S. Instant booking was no longer dilutive to the overall offering, and we've been improving both meta and IB since then. So I think it's a combination of factors, but it's just a sign that after fully incorporating instant booking in the U.S. now we're now better off than we were in 2014 and continue to show impressive growth to our revenue per shopper.","In terms of the desktop monetization gap, we've said in the past, if mobile monetizes roughly at one-third of desktop and those trends change a little quarter-over-quarter but not dramatically. We saw a quarter in the first quarter where there was revenue per shopper improvement on mobile. We had about 35% growth of our phone revenues and about 25% growth on the shopper line. And so we're very pleased with that, and we continue to sort of plug away making sure that we make that gap as small as we can.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you, Ernst.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And then in terms of your last questions about the Q2, yeah, again, with mobile as with the general comments I was making quarter to quarter, there may be some volatility in revenue per shopper or in monetization of mobile, but the long-term trend is pretty stable.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Daniel Powell - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks. This is Daniel Powell on for Heath. Just a couple quick ones from us. First, on the traffic growth and comments you've made around paid acquisition, just curious if you could give any comments on what you're actually seeing in organic search and how much of that is coloring your decision to lean more into paid acquisition. And then on the Non-Hotel side, I just want to make sure we're interpreting your comments there correctly about it approaching 2016 growth levels, maybe suggesting an acceleration in the back half of the year against some tougher comps. Is that driven by seasonality mostly or is there something else that's changed in the business? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thanks, Daniel, for the question. This is Steve. So I wouldn't say there is anything particularly different in our organic search trends. Google continues to take more space on search result pages on all devices for their own products and for other paid ads. There is nothing new in that statement. I've been saying something like it for several years now.","When we look at our overall marketing mix, we have more and more sort of brand traffic, we have paid traffic, we have organic traffic, we have our CRM program, and our focus at this point is on building what we call that branded direct traffic focused with a offline TV campaign in order to build more brand-direct, build more loyalty to Trip when a user is in mind for shopping. So I wouldn't say that shift is not a result of any specific organic search trend, but it is a change for us and we view a pretty meaningful one in terms of building the business for the long-term on a large component of brand-direct channels.","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","In terms of the Non-Hotel, it is indeed a very seasonal business and even the growth is somewhat seasonal. Last year in the first quarter, we posted from memory I believe 14% growth for Non-Hotel, which was substantially lower than the rest of the year. And indeed, we said in our prepared remarks that we expect for the full year Non-Hotel growth will be approaching the levels that we had for the full year of last year. So implied in that indeed is that we expect growth to be better in the rest of the year than the first quarter.","Other than underlying some of the seasonality we've seen in vacation rentals, for instance, a continued shift to a free-to-list model, which means we get paid on booking, which tends to happen in the summer rather than at the time of \u2013 at done stay, sorry, rather than at the time of booking. And then there's some currency issues in there again on Vacation Rentals but also our Attractions business are, for a large part, pound driven and, of course, we had Brexit in the adjustment to the pound happening in the second quarter of last year. So, all in all, a number of factors why we believe Q1 should be a lower point compared to the full year in terms of Non-Hotel growth.","Daniel Powell - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Nat Schindler with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Nat H. Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, hi, Ernst, just wanted to go over in little more detail on the guidance and\/or your profit outlook comments. You said you can maintain profit outlook comments, but at this point, your profit outlook comments are simply flat to down. So that, quite frankly, an infinite range. So if I look at ROI as negative on the brand campaign, I know you're switching out some inefficient marketing dollars to pay for that but there would be some revenue lift from that brand campaign as well. How much are you really thinking this hits on the negative line or are you saying that this has no impact from where you were thinking last quarter?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes, Nat. Thanks for that question. We said last quarter, we said flat to down and you are right, that we didn't specify what down really could imply. What we really wanted to signal in this quarter is that that outlook has not changed because of TV and that effectively, the negative impact on EBITDA we expect from TV. You said it's ROI negative, we believe it's ROI negative in the near term. In the long term, we think it's very much ROI positive, but we'll have a near-term drag on EBITDA, just the TV campaign itself, which is offset by these two drivers that I talked about, partly by reallocating some of our online spend. So we've looked at our total portfolio of advertising spend and said TV doesn't necessarily have to be just a bolt-on. We have looked at what does that mean for our online, and we have been allocating some expendables on the margin less efficient than the average and allocated that towards TV.","And then as we highlighted, we have upgraded our outlook on profitability of our Non-Hotel segment. And those two factors together for 2017 happen to be roughly equivalent to the EBITDA loss that we expect from the TV campaign.","So taken together do not have a meaningful impact on where we thought the business would be three months ago without this brand advertising campaign. And, therefore, we are reiterating the same guidance flat to down that we did a quarter ago.","Nat H. Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And just one secondary question on this, because this is happening fairly late in the year, I'm assuming that the $70 million to $80 million is smaller than you would do next year and the years after. And you mentioned a few years. This campaign will continue for at least a few years. Can you give us any color on what you think a normalized year on this campaign will be?","And then just on another corollary to this brand campaign, you pulled back after the 2014 and 2015 campaigns. You pulled back on those campaigns because they didn't work as well as you hoped. What makes you think that this time TV will work better?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes. So your observation is correct is that the $70 million to $80 million in 2017 is starting well into the year, of course. And, as such, as we look in following years, the investment will be over a full year rather than just over what is going to be roughly a little bit more than half a year in 2017. So that's a good observation.","The additional point is that we are starting with the U.S. and a handful of other markets, not yet with a global campaign. U.S. plus a handful of markets will be a very meaningful representation of our total revenues in these markets, of course, but not yet a global campaign, we may add other markets as we go forward.","It's a little early for us to be more specific about what our expectation is for spend in 2018. We're obviously going to have more information under our belt in the next few months as we are actually rolling out advertising in these markets and in due time, we'll revisit that question of what the size would be for 2018.","Nat H. Schindler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","And with respect to the brand campaigns that we had in 2014 and 2015, it's not that they were failures. They just didn't quite achieve all of the objectives that we had wanted at the time. So we're actually taking a number of the learnings from those campaigns and applying them. One of the learnings was, hey, we don't want to just say that you can book on TripAdvisor. We want to drive home the price \u2013 the point that you're going to find the best price on TripAdvisor. And that's more of a value orientation in the message.","And then, of course, the product needs to deliver that lowest-price front and center, and a couple of years ago, it didn't. The hero price on a particular page was not necessarily the cheapest and so we have added more supply into our store, and we've changed our algorithm, so that we're showing you better deals and we're showing you better prices all the time. So the product is delivering more of what our current advertising will be talking about. So you take those components, plus the learnings, and that gives us confidence that this ad campaign just literally based upon what we did learn from last time, will work for us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Paul Bieber with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning, Steve and Ernst. Thanks for taking my question. I apologize if it's already been asked, but how should we generally think about the privatization of meta versus instant book when you launch the new user interface in the coming months?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes. This is Steve. You shouldn't think of those as necessarily connected. We've been adjusting the placement of instant book over the past several quarters. It's floating more, or it's earning its right based upon what consumers want to do. And that aspect doesn't change as we roll out this new interface.","Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And just a quick follow-up, in terms of the TV ad campaign. Is the intent to drive more awareness of the overall TripAdvisor brand or is it to drive awareness of meta versus instant book?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Neither. We have tremendous aided brand awareness in most countries. We're looking to drive unaided awareness of TripAdvisor as a booking site. And so many people know us just as reviews and when they think they want to read reviews, they come to TripAdvisor. We want to make sure that when they're thinking about, \"Hey, I want to get a good deal on this hotel that I want to stay at,\" that they come to TripAdvisor for that purpose.","So, again, unaided booking awareness or unaided awareness as TripAdvisor is a booking site would be the key goal of that campaign. And the campaign is completely agnostic to instant book versus meta. It's about shopping, it's about booking the hotel.","Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of James Lee with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Hey, Steve, can you maybe talk about some of the new targeting technology that you introduced for hotel search? For example, from a couple of industry conferences we attended, a few agency talked about your firm offering like CRM targeting and retargeting using pixels.","And just curious how those technologies are performing versus your existing ones. And are you also testing maybe other technology like look-alike marketing as well on your platform? Thanks.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","So I'm going to answer the question as kind of what are the targeting technologies that we offer our CPC and CPM clients to best target the traffic that they want that's on our site. And so, for CPM, we have many years of dividing up audiences, luxury audiences. There is a type of a look-alike product that our sales force has been using quite successfully.","When it comes to the CPC, we do offer things like retargeting pixels on our clients' sites so that they can bid differentially on traffic that's been on their site that is now on TripAdvisor, presuming that's a more attractive customer for them. They can bid up and that's capabilities that we've offered for several quarters now.","Unknown Speaker","Are you seeing a very meaningful lift versus other targeting technology? Talking to some of your peers, especially on online marketing, when they start using CRM targeting, especially when it comes to search, they saw a pretty decent lift. I'm just wondering from your process of working with clients, how you are seeing that impact?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes, many of our clients have adopted many of the different things that we offer. You have to put it a little bit in perspective because we're familiar with retargeting capabilities as TripAdvisor advertises on other sites. And we tend to want to buy traffic to our site that has travel intent versus buying a car or a house or something. The folks that are looking to buy traffic on our site, all of our traffic is already prequalified as travel traffic.","So it's already past the major hurdle. Now we're looking to new ones or our clients are looking to nuance it or our clients are looking to nuance it with their retargeting pixels or their Lookalike Audiences. So, yes, it's valuable, but not necessarily which is why we offer and why a lot of clients use it, and you can kind of infer some of that goodness in our CPC numbers from the number of bookings that we drive for our clients, but it's not the same order of magnitude that a Facebook or a Google might be able to offer to their audiences.","Unknown Speaker","Steve, can I also ask you a question regarding mobile monetization, some of your peers have been successfully using cross device attribution because they have a lot of log-in ID. So they can use mobile to assess credit for desktop attribution for conversion. Are you doing the same thing right now internally? Just curious where you are in that process? Have you done any test at all? And have you seen any success using cross-device attribution on your platform?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","I'd say, we like many other companies, where a majority of our revenue is not from logged-in users do have a really tough time tracking that mobile attribution, that it frankly drives us a bit crazy because we qualify millions of travelers every day on our phone, on our app and website, and then send them over to our clients, and then those users come back the next day and book on desktop on our client sites, and of course, we can't track it, our clients can't track it. So we don't get the credit that we deserve. That's part of that big monetization leak that we keep referring to and that one day instant book will help us address on the phone.","But, no, I can't point to any tremendous data or successes in terms of cross-device attribution that we've been able to share with our clients. So still a work in progress for us.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks, Steve.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to go back to the marketing, again, apologies. You mentioned in the prepared remarks a handful of markets overseas. Can you just give us a little more color? Are you going to go in with a similar stance in terms of wait levels in weeks or is the international rollout more on a test basis? And any color you can give a sense of the coverage of your major international markets and whether the market list would be likely to expand appreciably next year or even later this year? Thank you.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Sure. So the handful of markets we'll sort of talk about the same message at a wait level that's appropriate for that market; i.e., not a small test but a meaningful spend so that we can see results and optimize.","It would be perfectly reasonable to read into our comments that as we move on TV in 2018 since we're a global company, there's no logical argument that we would limit it to just the handful of markets that we're in TV now. You might instead read into, well, we couldn't tackle all markets in the very beginning. There's simply a bandwidth question that's involved.","So we think we're making a very meaningful move here, limited by our ability to execute and the desire to learn as much as we can, as quickly as we can in order to optimize for next year.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you, Steve.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed.","Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Yeah, thank you very much. Steve, in the past, I think you've said that you think instant book is a better experience for mobile monetization. Do you still hold that view or do you think that it could be either instant book or meta? And then I had a follow-up question on the Non-Hotel side.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","So, when the instant book product has a parity price, then my personal opinion is it's a better product because it's fewer clicks to get what you want done. Where instant book has a worse price for whatever reason, we're not pushing it on you, because we're not asking you to spend more money for the privilege of using this path. And then rubber meets the road or the question is most relevant when you have a parity price with other providers, at which point, look, some users we fully expect to be loyal to a different booking site, they thank TripAdvisor for finding them the best price. That best price might be on Booking.com, and they click over to Booking.com, and they're happy with that experience, and we're fine with that. We got paid on the click and we helped drive the booking.","Other folks, because they're in the habit of booking on TripAdvisor, using our instant book with our stored credit card, will prefer the TripAdvisor option because it's literally fewer clicks to actually finish that booking. No need to switch. So our wealth of product capabilities here allows us to tailor the experience to what we think that individual traveler is looking for. And we think that's a great option. So instant book on the phone when it has the better price, is clearly a better experience than meta because it saved money. When it's the worst price, you're probably not going to see it a whole lot. And when it's at price parity, the user gets to decide, if you will, and we make our suggestion in terms of order based upon what we think the user wants to see.","Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. That's great. And then quickly on the Non-Hotel side, especially, on attractions, I think as previously said, you think of this as a three to five year sort of a investment opportunity, where you actually want to focus on growing the business. And I think we are in year three in 2017, and you're already looking at margins kind of turning positive. Do you think that this business is ready to see some margin expansion from here on? How should we think about it?","Ernst J. Teunissen - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Yes, observation correct, Naved, is we have described it as a three to five-year journey, and we are in year three and we're seeing profits come through this year. We have invested significant amounts of dollars in 2015 and 2016 in growing our supply. But importantly, as Steve noted earlier, in making all this bookable supply also available on the TripAdvisor site where we have most leverage in terms of exposing it to the largest number of users. And we're now seeing that flywheel of supply, getting supply on, then making it available to all of these TripAdvisor users start to work, and so this is the first year where we, in aggregate, are profitable for this Non-Hotel segment which is a great trend, and we believe in the long-term, will make this segment not just a growing but a very profitable segment.","Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Ernst.","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. So now it's my pleasure to hand the conference back over to Mr. Steve Kaufer, Chief Executive Officer for closing comments and remarks. Sir?","Stephen Kaufer - TripAdvisor, Inc.","Well, thank you, everyone, for joining the call. The first quarter 2017 was a great starting point to the year. We still have a lot of work ahead of us, but we are making progress on all of our initiatives as we build the best user experience in travel. I want to thank our employees around the globe for their continued hard work, and we look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Will Lyons, TripAdvisor's Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Will Lyons","Thanks, Kate. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to TripAdvisor's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Steve Kaufer, CEO; and Julie Bradley, CFO. We distributed our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at ir.tripadvisor.com. In it, you will find reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures discussed on this call. On our Investor Relations website, we have also posted supplemental financial information including non-GAAP financial measures.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that estimates and other forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's views as of today, November 4, 2014. TripAdvisor disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. Please refer to today's earnings release and TripAdvisor's filings with the SEC for information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, technology and content expense and total expenses are non-GAAP measures as defined in our earnings release and all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2013. And now I'll turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen Kaufer","Thank you, Will, and welcome everyone. Total revenue growth accelerated to 39%, coming in at $354 million driven primarily by 31% growth in our click-based revenue as well as by our Viator acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA increased 14% to $119 million. These results, while strong, were not as strong as contemplated by our Q1 and Q2 guidance commentary. Julie will provide more color in her remarks, but I would like to take this opportunity to address some of the factors that negatively affected our performance this quarter.","In our click-based business, declines in clicks per hotel shopper on our site had been a headwind to our forecast since mid-August. While we saw a similar decline in 2012, in years prior in our classic display, our results last year from our new metasearch display suggested a minimal, if any, seasonal decline. Current data suggest that we continue to be impacted by seasonality but to a lesser extent than pre-metasearch. At this point, we believe the seasonal clicks per shopper trend may have been masked by optimization gains we were making in the metasearch experience throughout the back half of 2013. While this continued seasonal impact makes us incrementally cautious, it's important to note that our click-based auction continues to be healthy, and our revenue per hotel shopper growth accelerated in Q3 to 14%, up from 11% growth in Q2.","Our EBITDA results reflect our revenue headwinds since August and also include acquisition-related expenses and the investments we're making to capture market share in restaurants and attractions. Above all, our third quarter illustrates how we're executing on our strategy to deliver more value to users and partners throughout all phases of travel planning and trip taking. We're growing content and community. We're innovating our products and platform. We're winning on mobile devices, and we're increasing the growth trajectory outside of hotels by welcoming Viator to the TripAdvisor family.","In terms of content and community, we now have nearly 200 million reviews and opinions, growing at 115 contributions per minute in 28 different languages. This fresh rich content helps travelers choose from more than 1.5 million places to stay including 890,000 hotels as well as 2.4 million restaurants and 480,000 attractions around the globe.","Traffic to our sites remains robust as Q3 monthly unique visitors was 315 million according to Google Analytics, up 20% year-over-year, and unique hotel shoppers grew 17% according to our log files. Nearly 50% of users visited TripAdvisor via tablet and phone, and we're continuing to see industry-leading uptake and engagement on mobile devices.","Traffic to non-hotel pages, including restaurants and attractions, continues to grow faster than our average. In a minute, I'll describe how we're leveraging our industry leading media assets and investing heavily to match more users with more advertising partners in these categories.","We're amplifying our consumer message through an offline ad campaign, and I'm pleased to add that we're seeing positive results. TV is increasingly cited in user surveys as the reason someone visited TripAdvisor. Google Trends data shows traffic uplifts in the U.S., France, Australia and Canada, the markets in which we have been on-air.","Traditional offline marketing is becoming a nice complement to our ongoing permanent branding efforts, the awards, certificates, stickers and badges that give consumers confidence at hotels, restaurants, attractions and on websites all around the globe. Based upon our experience this year, we expect to expand our TV ad campaign in 2015.","We're also in the early days of a number of product and platform initiatives that will make TripAdvisor more valuable to users and partners alike. In hotels, we have made nice progress on our Instant Booking initiatives since launching with 3 initial partners to a small percentage of U.S. smartphone users just 6 months ago. On the user side, shoppers appear to understand and really like the Instant Booking experience on TripAdvisor. Users are clicking on the Book on TripAdvisor option more frequently than its metasearch equivalent and most importantly, users are converting to bookings at a higher rate.","As expected, we started rolling out Instant Booking to U.S. desktop and tablet users in Q3. Notably, Best Western was the first supplier to make all of their properties instantly bookable on all devices.","For now, the user cohort that can experience this feature is relatively small as we focus on the U.S. first before rolling out more broadly. A more deliberate rollout schedule allows our teams greater flexibility to onboard more partners to optimize the booking funnel and to ensure that every booking is delivered quickly, accurately and securely. Instant Booking is a really great feature, and we are eager to get it in the hands of more hotel shoppers around the world.","On the partner side, momentum is building globally. We have 6 partners live and another 16 signed and pending implementation. Specific to OTAs, in addition to getaroom and Tingo, AMOMA and Jetsetter are now live on the site, and we are working through implementations with another 9 OTAs, including Asiatravel, HotelsClick and otel.com. On the supplier side, in addition to Best Western and Choice, we've signed contracts and are working through implementation with another 7 chains. We like our recent traction, especially with regional international players in India, APAC and LatAm who are looking to increase their share of voice on our platform.","We've also introduced Instant Booking to independent hoteliers through our TripConnect platform. While this is still in beta, we have already connected a handful of Internet booking engine partners, and we expect to connect many more over time. As we onboard these booking partners, the focus shifts to educating independent hoteliers about how they can access our global audience and drive bookings through a commission model rather than cost per click. We are offering independents a new way to advertise on TripAdvisor, and we see this as additive to any OTA relationship that independent hoteliers may have.","Beyond Instant Booking, after almost a year of extensive testing and iterating, we've officially launched our personalization feature, Just for You. This is a big change as it fundamentally transforms our one-size-fits-all sort order into a highly adaptive recommendation engine, matching travelers with their ideal hotels based on content, travel preferences, intent to purchase, site behavior and users like you. Users can now see this feature globally in all cities that have 10 or more hotel listings on desktop and tablet web. Getting personalization right is extremely difficult in travel, a category in which consumers' needs are nuanced, contextual and episodic.","We're excited about personalization. We're applying TripAdvisor's scale and consumer-centric focus to deliver users a more helpful and differentiated experience. We have a unique understanding of travelers and with Just for You for hotels, we believe that we are just scratching the surface of what's possible.","Helping our users find, research and book the best hotel remains our top strategic priority. At the same time, we're engaged in the early stages of leveraging our significant media assets in restaurants and attractions to unlock even more value for TripAdvisor users, advertising partners and our business.","Restaurants are a natural extension for TripAdvisor given our fast-growing global audience of both travelers and locals, our rich content on 2.4 million restaurant listings and our growing lead in mobile. In just a short time since our LaFourchette acquisition, we've streamlined the research and reservation booking experience and rolled out a new instant reservation feature. This has tripled the number of seated diners from TripAdvisor through the LaFourchette platform. We're also working hard to expand LaFourchette's reach to more international markets.","We're executing a similar playbook in attractions, our third largest source of demand after hotels and restaurants. From a long-term perspective, our acquisition of Viator, a global tours and attractions leader with 20,000 listings in 1,500 destinations in 10 different languages, was one of the biggest developments this quarter. Similar to our strong position in accommodations and restaurants, we are already an established global leader in this category. With Viator, we can now offer consumers an end-to-end research and direct booking experience.","Since closing the deal in August, we have seen a significant uptick in attraction bookings through our platform. We see a lot of opportunity ahead in what PhoCusWright calls an $80 billion annualized market opportunity. LaFourchette and Viator are exciting developments for our long-term growth. We've added 2 great teams, we've reinforced our user value proposition in these categories and I'm very pleased with the path we're on.","In mobile, the ongoing shift plays to our competitive strengths. Nearly 50% of our users are on mobile devices now, and we just crossed the 150 million cumulative download mark for our top ranked apps. This includes more than 135 million downloads of our best-in-class TripAdvisor app, which itself has been growing organically at triple digit rates for the past 5 straight quarters.","Looking specifically at smartphone. We've been executing well against our multiphase plan. We added metasearch in 2012, native apps last year and continued to reduce friction for more users on more screens in more ways throughout travel planning and trip taking. As a result, we continue to see triple digit revenue growth on smartphone driven by increased traffic and better monetization on that device. Repeat usage on our native apps has been rising this year, another solid indicator of success.","On TripAdvisor, advertisers get the unique opportunity to deliver the right advertisement to the right user at just the right time in front of a massive and growing global audience. As we look forward to 2015, we are carefully considering a number of media-related ad products, particularly on mobile that serve to reinforce TripAdvisor as the perfect travel companion and making it an even more attractive platform for advertisers.","Switching gears to another adjacent growth opportunity, Vacation Rentals. Our free-to-list transaction model continues to gain traction. We now offer users nearly 650,000 vacation rental listings, up 36%, providing consumers with greater choice. We're leveraging search and CRM in order to drive increasing demand through better user conversion. Free-to-list bookings increased more than 200% in Q3, and we see this becoming an even larger part of our Vacation Rental mix over time.","To conclude, it's been a very solid 2014 so far. The fundamentals of the business are strong, and I'm pleased with our progress in all of our key initiatives. Continuing to move fast is imperative, and we believe investing today in our brand, product innovation and expanding our platform is the best way to drive long-term, broad-based and profitable growth.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Julie.","Julie M. B. Bradley","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Third quarter total revenue was $354 million as growth accelerated to 39%, up from 31% in Q2. This was driven by our PPC business as well as nice contribution from our new restaurants and attraction businesses, LaFourchette and Viator. FX provided a 1% tailwind. Click-based revenue growth accelerated to 31%, up from 28% in Q2 and 13% in Q3 of last year due to stable, strong CPC pricing in the metasearch auction as well as from lapping our metasearch transition last year.","As Steve mentioned, Q3 performance was not as robust as contemplated in Q1 and Q2 guidance commentary. Since mid-August, we have seen greater seasonal decline in our clicks per shopper metric than in comparable periods of 2013, but which prominently existed in the years prior to the metasearch transition. Our most recent data suggest that seasonality is reduced but not eliminated by metasearch. Given stable hotel shopper growth and stable CPC pricing, the clicks per hotel shopper trends were a tailwind -- excuse me, were a headwind to our Q3 click-based revenue growth, and our updated outlook factors in continued seasonality in Q4.","This illustrates how impacts from transformative improvements can be extremely difficult to forecast. Starting with our 2011 site redesign and then metasearch in late 2012 and 2013, impacts from these initiatives are amplified, yet are not always clearly visible until we fully lap the change.","Display revenue growth remains solid at 13%, despite a 14 point tougher comp as marketers look to gain access to our community of over 300 million monthly visitors. We're seeing rising spend from the destination marketing organization sector worldwide, and hoteliers are increasingly shifting their budgets to an always on spend cadence rather than traditional, sporadic campaign investments. I will note that the 13% growth compares very favorably with declines posted by many other CPM-based businesses. We have always maintained a premium position in the travel marketplace and continue to be considered a must-buy by many of the major travel brands.","Subscription, transaction and other revenue grew 106% and included a full quarter contribution from LaFourchette as well as consolidated Viator results since August 8 closing date. Steve noted the continued traction from free-to-list in Vacation Rentals, and we expect that our portfolio mix will continue to shift towards this transaction-based product.","On the expense side, in line with our expectations, total expenses increased 56% driven by ongoing investments in online and offline marketing and headcount. More specifically, we invested approximately $19 million in offline advertising in Q3, up for more than $10 million in Q2 and approximately $2 million in Q3 2013. We are on track to invest just over $30 million in TV this year, and we are actively laying the groundwork to expand the campaign next year. We also had a full quarter impact from our 3 acquisitions in Q2, and we have consolidated Viator in our results since August 8.","As a result, adjusted EBITDA of $119 million was up 14% and adjusted EBITDA margin was 34%. We're focused on fueling business growth not only in the hotels, but also in restaurants, attractions, Vacation Rentals and China, inherently lower margin businesses that are also at an earlier stage of growth. We anticipate continuing to be a net investor in these non-hotel categories to rapidly scale and capture market share.","Moving on to taxes. Our Q3 GAAP effective tax rate of 28% decreased sequentially primarily due to changes in full year forecasted geographical mix. We continue to expect our GAAP effective tax rate for the full year to be in line with our 2013 rate of approximately 28%. As for share count, we had 146 million diluted shares outstanding during Q3.","In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $58 million of cash from operations during the third quarter of 2014, primarily due to seasonality and timing in deferred merchant payables as well as timing of our offline ad campaign, customer receipts and vendor payments. We also spent approximately $13 million on CapEx or 4% of revenue driven by capitalized engineering salary and leasehold improvements to support global office expansion.","From a liquidity standpoint, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities decreased $107 million during the quarter to $614 million driven primarily by free cash flow of $45 million offset by the net cash outlay to complete our Viator acquisition. We have just over $100 million remaining on our existing share repurchase plan, outstanding borrowings of $310 million as well as an undrawn credit facility of $200 million.","As I turn to guidance, in click-based revenue, we expect that the clicks per hotel shopper seasonality headwind from Q3 will continue in Q4. Given the high flow-through of the click-based business, its impact drops straight to the bottom line. In our display business, I'll remind everyone that Q4 is our toughest comp as we are still lapping the benefits from our delayed ad call innovation last year, and we also benefited from large end-of-year ad buys that may or may not reoccur. In subscription, transaction and other revenue, our shift to free-to-list increases seasonality in Vacation Rentals, and our forecast for the balance of 2014 includes a full quarter's worth top line and bottom line impact from our Viator acquisition.","As for 2014 revenue expectations, we are reiterating our full year total revenue growth expectation of high 20s to low 30s. We now expect click-based revenue growth in the mid-20s. We continue to expect display-based growth in the mid- to high teens, and we are raising expectations for subscription, transaction and other revenue growth to the low 80s, which includes a full quarter contribution from Viator.","On the expense side, we are leveraging our very large and profitable hotel business to capture market share in attractions. This is squarely in line with our stated philosophy, and we believe we are appropriately balancing our long-term and near-term growth objectives. Rolling it up, we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA growth in the low 20s. Roughly half of our revised thoughts relate to the click-based seasonality headwinds, while the other half comes from acquisition-related expenses in ongoing investments to capture market share in attractions.","As a reminder, we do not manage the business to a margin target, in part due to our willingness to strategically invest in growth but also because our major product enhancements can impact top line. While we measure countless metrics each day in order to run the business effectively and efficiently, we measure the success of our business over 2- to 5-year increments and firmly believe that we are making the correct strategic decisions to maximize value over that time frame.","I'll also note that these expectations are based on currently available data, including foreign exchange rates. As a reminder, our click-based revenue is highly sensitive to fluctuations in hotel shopper growth, clicks per shopper and CPC pricing, including those impacted by fluctuations in local currency. Additionally, similar to last year's metasearch initiative, while Instant Booking is an exciting usability improvement for users, it may have financial impacts either positive or negative that we are unable to forecast.","In closing, we're excited about what we've accomplished to date and believe we are well positioned for what lies ahead. We will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple, if I may. Just first, you mentioned in the prepared remarks, Steve, that when given the option, hotel shoppers click on the instant book option more often than the metasearch option. Can you give us a sense for how revenue per hotel shopper is in these scenarios versus core metasearch? So is there enough conversion to make up for the reduction in metasearch clicks? And then secondly for Julie, it sounds like you guys are pretty upbeat on the TV spend, but it doesn't look like shopper growth is accelerating. And then when you look at the direct marketing spend even excluding the TV, it looks like it's up about 6 percentage points year-over-year as a percent of click-based revenue. Can you just kind of elaborate on what's driving that deleverage outside of TV and when we should start to see that impact shopper growth?","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. I will delightfully take a shot. When I talked about the click on Book on TripAdvisor button, one of the question marks we had when rolling this out was whether our travelers would be interested in an experience that sounded like following through the booking on TripAdvisor. And so when we put it out there, there really was a big question mark internally: Would people skip over that button and go straight to some of the other metasearch options? And we were pleased to see that no, our consumers were perfectly happy to click the Book on TripAdvisor button. So that kind of addressed the first -- or one of the earlier concerns when we had rolled it out on the desktop experience. So we then measure the entire funnel as you can imagine: How many clicks are coming in? What's the conversion rate within that funnel? What's the rate of credit card declines and all that? What's the commission rate that we're getting paid, which naturally varies by supplier, and multiply that out by the average daily rate and you'll get something that we calculate back to being an effective CPC and then we look and compare that against the other CPCs in the meta action. Not surprisingly, early stage, we find sometimes the effective CPC is more than we're getting in the meta auction. Other times, it's less than we're getting in the meta auction, depending on who the provider is, depending on a bunch of other factors. But frankly, we're still trying to understand in enough details so that when we go and roll this out more broadly, we're rolling it out in a smart way and effective way. The last thing we want is for our consumers to be enticed with a Book on trip TripAdvisor click-through and then not get the experience that actually lets them finish the transaction, and we're pretty careful about not rolling that out sooner. To jump in on kind of TV for a minute, it's always, and everyone will tell you, hard to measure the effectiveness of TV. We look at signs from our user survey. We look at Google Trends data. We look at our domain-direct. And it's pretty clear when we're on, we can see a lift and our consumers tell about that lift. Why did you visit TripAdvisor today? \"Well, I saw a TV ad.\" Always hard to know how many of those visitors would have come anyways because they would've stumbled across us through their normal research channels or come to domain-direct anyways. So we've received enough signals to believe that it's working at a reasonable ROI for us, not a profitable ROI for us, as measured in a single week or a single month. And we're keeping a sharp eye to understand how much of that return on investment takes time to build because after all, the whole point of that offline experience is to build up the brand awareness over time. We can't measure it in a single month or even a single campaign. So tough for us to measure, but we've seen enough positive signs that we want to set expectations that it would be likely to be -- likely but not guaranteed to be growing for next year.","Julie M. B. Bradley","Great. Thanks, Lloyd. I'll take the second part of your question about the selling and marketing expenses. When I look at the year-over-year compare as a percentage of revenue and exclude the net impact, which was about $16 million more TV spend in this past Q3 than a year ago quarter, we're only about 2% off -- 2 percentage points off for percentage of revenue. I'll tell you, our LaFourchette acquisition and Viator to a smaller degree are more skewed towards sales and marketing expenses than technology expenses. So I think pretty much looking at as a percentage of revenue and also consistent in direct to indirect, which continues to be about a 70-30 split where we're right on the same path.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two quick questions please. I think that your math says -- implies that you'll do very little TV advertising in the fourth quarter. Is that just for seasonal reasons? Because I think you talked about maybe amping that up a little bit more next year. And then just briefly, are you seeing any signs of macro weakness in Europe? Priceline was talking about it this morning. It doesn't show up in your September quarter numbers. Are they just seeing something different? Is there a reason they would see something different than what you're seeing?","Stephen Kaufer","Sure, Mark. So you're right. We expect to be much quieter in Q4 in terms of the TV spend. It's just not an optimal season to be advertising in our current market. So it's us sort of catching up to what always should be done, and then you'll see a sort of more spread as opposed to more concentrated spend next year according to our current thought process.","Julie M. B. Bradley","Sure, and I'll take the EMEA question. So our guidance does show that the trend line for EMEA is not much different than what we've seen in the past where we're always having a decrease in revenue -- percent of revenue from EMEA. However, we do include in our guidance the negative impact from FX. So if I was just to look at October, for example, baked into that is about a 2% headwind and extrapolated over the balance of the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.","Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Steve, on Instant Booking, you made a comment that you're seeing a conversion of those bookings at a higher rate. Wanted to know if we can understand a little bit of quantification around that, and you also mentioned that there's another 7 chains you're working with. Wanted to understand sort of the onboarding process and what the dialogue with the general hotel industry is about Instant Booking.","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. Happy to try to help, Eric. So we wouldn't ever go into specific conversion rate by partners, but what we have seen is that when it's particularly a supplier brand, we see a higher conversion rate than an intermediary like Tingo. That really wouldn't come as a surprise to anyone, but we've now seen it on desktop with Best Western. I caution it's on a limited set of data. It's a limited number of OTAs and it's a limited number of chains. But the conversion rate, the presumed safety of booking with the supplier, we expect to continue. In terms of the chains, it's a bit of a new animal for a hotel chain to get their arms around. What I mean is when we go talk with them, they say, \"Another channel, sounds great. A commission-based channel, that's easier for me to understand than a click-based channel in terms of measuring an ROI for me. Sounds like you're close to an OTA.\" But wait a minute, we're not really an OTA. We're facilitating a booking that's going to end up being supported service from the hotel itself, the hotel chain. So it's a little bit in between. It's an assisted book or an instant book, and that causes a little bit more confusion than we would like on the part of the hoteliers. I think it's fair to generalize and say every supplier, every chain that we talk to would very much like to participate in the Instant Booking program. There's kind of no downside for them. The challenge is connectivity. There is some technical work that gets done on both sides in order to link the companies together. And then there's a challenge of a contract in how they choose to allocate the commission dollars, whether we're treated like an OTA channel or we're treated like a direct booking, and each different chain has a different way of approaching that. Having said that, we now have a bunch more chains signed. We're in legal review with quite a few others, and the pipeline continues to grow not as fast as we would like in terms of being live on the site, but it does continue to grow. And I have very little concern about not being able to sign up the chains because it's a fairly straightforward value proposition for them. It's just the time frame that makes it very hard for me to predict.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Sena with Evercore.","Kenneth Sena - Evercore ISI, Research Division","So you mentioned a rising usage rate or repeat rate on native apps. Maybe could you provide a little detail on that as well as some of the newer mobile marketing alternative channels that you're looking at exploring. And then also, just any color on maybe the use of app install ads and kind of what sort of efficiency you're seeing there.","Stephen Kaufer","Sure, Ken. So we are seeing our monthly active users growing on the app. I'd certainly expect that given the number of usability and other improvements that the team has put in to making the overall app just a much better experience. When we refer to newer ad products, we look and say, as most companies of our size would say, there's a lot of traffic that's shifting over to the phone and a standard CPM ad doesn't work all that well there. We do have CPM ads available on the phone. They're not our preferred method of helping our advertisers reach the target audience. So we look in 2015 and we have the challenge to say, \"How are we going to monetize the eyeballs in a much more effective way than we have so far without obviously getting in the way of the user experience?\" In terms of the growth of the actual app installs, we are particularly active in the download acquisition market, if that was the question. So we get our app usage primarily from folks that find us in the App Store, have heard about us, recommended from friends or visit the mobile website and are teased to download the app, which is just a faster and better experience.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt with Stifel.","Scott W. Devitt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I had a couple. It does seem like the industry is becoming quite a bit more competitive, and TRIP -- the value in your system from a distribution standpoint resides in the traffic and the traffic growth, at least it seems. And so I'm just wondering if the brand spend offline and otherwise is something that you think is going to continue to increase as a percentage of revenue over time as you secure your position of relevance with the OTAs and suppliers. And then secondly, Steve, you noted the click per hotel shopper being weaker than expected. Expedia talked about the shift in -- and potentially toward their own platform in Trivago. And I'm wondering in terms of any success that maybe the OTAs are having with their metasearch product, whether that's shifting underlying budgets as well and your view on that.","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. So to take the second question first, I don't think budgets are shifting. All of our OTAs continue to want to spend as much as they can effectively on our platform, and when other clients talk about TripAdvisor's not being the most ROI-effective channel for them, that's really not us setting pricing. That's the auction dynamic saying this is what the competitive marketplace will pay for the lead. So it's kind of a sign that pricing is pretty effective from our perspective. I haven't -- I don't think I've ever spoken with an OTA who was cutting a budget with a particular source so long as that source was profitable. Every -- all of our clients want more and more traffic so long as the unit economics work for them. So less of a fixed budget mentality than anything that's profitable. In terms of the offline brand spend, it's absolutely a very competitive market out there trying to get first crack at a traveler who's planning a trip. We have some inherent advantages in the sense that our content and our brand is plastered all over the place, offline, in the restaurants, in certificates in hotels. It might be the guest card after you leave a hotel. It might be an email, a solicitation to collect a review sent on the part of a hotel. It might be the logo or the ratings on a destination marketing site or an OTA site globally, or just the individual hotelier's Facebook page that says, \"Hey, you can come see the TripAdvisor reviews that are posted there through our widget.\" So we get a ton of wonderful branding that way that we have complemented with our offline campaign. So when we try to estimate the amount that some of our competition is spending offline, we don't feel like we have to match that in order to achieve an even greater penetration in the consumers' mindset because of all the other activities that have been going on and are representing our content and our brand value proposition in a way that we really like. It's decision support. It's helping the traveler plan that right research experience, plan that right trip and it all points back to TripAdvisor. So while we do currently expect an expansion of the ad campaign compared to our partners at least, it's off of quite a small base.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nat Schindler with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Nathaniel H. Schindler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You've said in the past that monetization of the smartphone was less than 5% of desktop. Then you've also said here that your monetization on -- your revenue on smartphones is triple-digit growth. So I'm assuming that distance has shrunk a bit. Can you give us an update on that? And also, a little bit of discussion what has been the biggest driver of increased monetization on smartphones.","Stephen Kaufer","Well, I'd say that the biggest driver of revenue from smartphones has certainly been the growth in the installed base or the overall traffic growth split between mobile web and app installs. You take that, plus it's getting to scale. So at scale, it's starting to fetch maybe a more active CPC bidding environment as more people are interested in the traffic. And then we've done a lot of hard work to make the experience and the frictionless part of the experience better. And so we're not at the point of kind of disclosing overall smartphone revenue. But when we look forward and we see that traffic trend increasing, we feel like we're in a much better place than we were a couple years ago in terms of us being able to monetize that traffic shift.","Nathaniel H. Schindler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. On a related question, you can kind of tease out from some of the information you've given over the last several quarters that it looks like most, if not all, or potentially even more than all of your traffic growth has come from mobile. Are you seeing growth in your desktop users still?","Stephen Kaufer","So the combination of desktop and tablet, I believe, continues to grow, not nearly what it was several years ago as consumers shift over to using the phone for lots of browsing. When we look at, and it's one of the things that's a challenge for us and probably every other Internet company that doesn't have signed-in users, how do we know how much that phone traffic is doing the research and then coming back to their familiar or big-screen desktop tablet to finish the research and do the purchase? Anecdotally, we know it's a chunk. Metric-wise, it's a bit hard to actually measure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So you've gotten into restaurants and attractions. Are there other categories that make sense to expand TripAdvisor as a booking channel and monetize some of the content that you have? I guess in other words, are there other categories where you have strong content that don't currently have any accompanying booking channel through which to monetize that content?","Stephen Kaufer","Well, I guess sort of restaurants and attraction kind of flushes out the list for us. So it's the hotels, the airfare and the airlines, vacation rentals and now restaurants and attractions. And if you look at TripAdvisor, that's kind of most of the transaction-related things that we do. There's -- I guess there's car rental we don't really touch and don't have any immediate plans, and we have a subsidiary, Cruise Critic, that takes care of the cruise area for us. So long-winded answer to kind of saying, no, I think we're pretty much set in terms of looking at the categories in which we can monetize our traffic.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then separately, you mentioned China as one of the areas of continued investment. There's been signs of incrementally more competition in that market. Are you guys seeing or anticipating China will become more competitive in the coming quarters?","Stephen Kaufer","While we do view it as phenomenally competitive already with meaningfully different dynamics than any other country that we're in, you're right, we continue our investment because we look at the size of the outbound travel growth over the past couple of years and the next several and say getting a decent share of that is a pretty big win. And we look at the outbound travel segment as an area where we have some pretty meaningful content differentiation from most of the other players. And it's not that we plan to give up on any of the domestic travel, but focus on where our strengths are and our strengths are clearly leveraging the database of points of interest of hotels, attractions, restaurants and reviews, photos and the rest for any outbound destination that a Chinese resident would look to travel to.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom White with Macquarie.","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to go back to the TV question for a second. 3 ways to increase your spend: weight, weeks or countries. Could you comment on your expansion? And should we expect this to be adding geography or more weighted to the countries you're in? And then secondly, wondering, Steve, if you could elaborate a little bit on the Just for You personalization. What kind of data signals are you getting? And wondering if you could share any color on what percent of your users routinely log in.","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. 2 excellent questions, Peter, thank you. In terms of the TV advertising, yes, we would expect to add new geographies to advertise in, and we're not sure whether we would have a meaningful up weight to our current markets. We'll figure that out as we go, can't give you much more color there. In terms of the Just for You, we specifically built it so that you did not need to log in to get a benefit from that personalization. So right now if you're living outside of the U.S. and you are looking at a major city, you'll see a Just for You list that's different in terms of the hotels that might be recommended for you than if you were looking at that same list in the U.S. In part, that's a simple filter on -- as so many of our reviews are written by Americans. We're helping folks from other countries perhaps see a better recommendation not as tilted towards Americans. When you browse around the site, we're also going to start to influence the results, and browsing takes a number of different forms. You can browse, you can show much deeper purchase intent by looking at or even booking a particular property. And so we want the experience to be valuable not just to our logged in users, but to those that browse. If you're logged in and you've written a review in the past and we've seen what you've done, wow, we can go to a whole new level in terms of looking at the things that you've liked as in the positive reviews that you've given as well as what other people like you have also enjoyed and make more specific recommendations. I take a moment to point out, as I did in my prepared remarks, that we do think it is just the beginning of what we're going to be able to do here. We have a tremendous amount of data. Only a few other companies on the planet have the amount of data that we have on traveler preferences covering any type of lodging, all of the restaurants, all of the attractions that we have and how we can use that to personalize the experience that, at the end of the day, give you a better recommendation. How do we measure that? Well, one of the things when we look -- how do we measure whether a recommendation is better is that as we give you a new sort on a hotel list, we're seeing people click on the hotels that are listed higher in the new sort order versus the old one. Again, a simple indication that says the way we're presenting information is now better than it was before, and we're getting people to take the next step to read the reviews or go and book the properties. Amusingly, they have some unintended short-term consequences, right, because if we get people to the exact property super quickly, they might only generate 1 or 2 clicks in that session versus 3 or 4 or 5. And since we charge on the meta land on a per-click basis, that might actually generate a little bit less revenue. But wait a minute, since we're sending the user downstream to a client, and those clients fundamentally pay us for bookings not just clicks, because we're sending a better recommendation, they're much more likely to actually book, consummate the transaction so that the quality of our leads improves. Quality of leads improves means the clients can pay us more, and we see that time and time again. So in turn, it might be a few -- it might be a little bit fewer clicks to, in fact, generate higher CPCs down the road as the way we actually make a bit more money by giving a better experience to the user. We think to that specific example, it's far too much in the noise to call that out as a kind of revenue risk headwind, whatever. We think the personalized experience in getting the user to come back to TripAdvisor, because we made a better recommendation, is far and away the win as opposed to a specific monetary gain short term.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.","Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, I just want to ask about seasonality, the comments that you had made earlier, Steve. I just wanted to understand what was so different here, and my understanding over the years is, in the travel sector, that seasonality is kind of generally more predictable. Is it just that last year, you didn't see it as much because of the meta moves, but you had actually seen it in the years prior to that? And then just secondly, I know it's early here in terms of '15, but can you give us some thoughts on your kind of puts and takes around hotel shopper growth and revenue per hotel shopper as you think about it into '15?","Julie M. B. Bradley","Doug, it's Julie. I'll take the first part of it. The seasonality that we are talking about related directly to the clicks per hotel shopper, not overall seasonality. We still do have Q3, revenue is much stronger seasonally in the third quarter than the other quarters. But when we were looking at 2013 trend lines for clicks per hotel shopper, that metric, it stabilized last year once we had fully rolled out the metasearch. So we took that to mean that the metasearch significantly reduced the seasonality and -- because previous years, we had seen considerable declines in clicks per hotel shopper. And -- but then based -- once we got into this year, mid-August in particularly, what we were seeing made us believe that historical seasonality does still exist, but it was just being muted by all of the great revenue optimizations that we were making last year. So we believe it's less going forward with metasearch, but it is not eliminated and there's been no other -- given that everything else is stable, there's no other structural changes. It was just a seasonality that we didn't see in previous data.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with SIG.","Brian Nowak - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I have 2, please. Just to go back to the greater-than-expected seasonality in the clicks per hotel shopper. As you study all the data from your site, is there anything that changed throughout this quarter that's kind of causing you to have to guide down the revenue and the decline in clicks per user? And what gives you confidence that this isn't a structural change or a change in the quality of the traffic so that 2015 clicks per shopper will be better? And then secondly, is there any way just so we can better understand -- can you quantify that metric a little bit more? Roughly, how many clicks are there per hotel shopper right now?","Julie M. B. Bradley","Sure. When looking at the data, especially it's helpful to look back several years, and you can see the seasonality patterns in the year kind of increased in clicks per hotel shopper going into Q3 and then it declines coming out of Q3. Now with meta, when we looked at that as we were rolling it out last year, there was -- once it was fully rolled out in the June time frame, we saw the stabilization in the clicks per hotel shopper and -- which would lead us to believe that this historical seasonality didn't exist because the consumers were able to see price and availability right online and they were further down the purchase path when they eventually clicked off. So all that activity happening in Q3, they're on TripAdvisor but they're -- they didn't need to click in order to keep researching, so it made sense. What we saw in 2014 was some of that seasonality did exist, so we saw an uptick in clicks per shopper. And then starting in Midsummer, we saw a slight decline in clicks per hotel shopper. So it's definitely being muted. It does not -- it was not eliminated. So we were able to go back to previous year's trend lines prior to the meta rollout and understand what a muted seasonality would look like versus an elimination, and that's what we've baked into our guidance for the back half of the year.","Brian Nowak - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Great. And any help at all on the rough number of clicks right now per hotel shopper?","Julie M. B. Bradley","So we don't break out that number.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.","Heath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess just if you could give us a sense, Steve. You've talked in the past about sort of the holdups to signing more hotel partners into instant book. You mentioned having sort of 7 more that you've been able to sign or begin the process of signing or bringing on board. Can you give us a sense of what it was that was different about this 7 in terms of their willingness to join and maybe a bit of an update on what the existing roadblocks are for other hotel suppliers coming on to the platform?","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. Thanks, Heath. I won't call out or I can't think of a specific roadblock. There's a standard commission negotiation, but what we've got is something different than what they're used to dealing with. They're -- in general, a chain is used to dealing with a channel at a 12% commission, a 15% commission, a 20% commission and that's what every room is sold at. And in our case, we want partners to come on board, but it's still a sort of a quality score, if you will, on the Instant Booking opportunity. So what I mean by that is we're looking to present the booking option to our consumers that kind of -- that does the best, the combination of has a good or the best price and has the brand that lets the -- that encourages the consumer to actually finish the transaction and that has a good level of service so that it can keep the TripAdvisor name behind it. And when you take all those into account, it's just different than what a chain normally deals with when they sign up a channel. So with these 7, we got them through the process. We got them to understand what it is. They said, \"Yes, okay. I'll try it, sounds good,\" and they're in the implementation stages, which in turn varies quite a bit between the different chains depending on the level of APIs that we already have with other providers. I go back to there isn't a particular reason why a chain doesn't want to participate, but there is a commission negotiation and there are some other terms that slow things down, for lack of a better way to phrase it.","Operator","Our last question will come from the line of Ron Zember with Nomura.","Ron Zember","Quick question on Instant Booking on desktop and tablets versus mobile, and I recognize that it's still early innings here in terms of the rollout. But if we look at the comparable time frame, is there a similar impact on desktop and tablets versus the impact that you saw on mobile in terms of pricing and in terms of conversions? And then I know you guys aren't quantifying clicks per shopper, but was wondering if you might be able to give us a qualitative understanding of how that's -- what the trajectories look like for the last few quarters.","Stephen Kaufer","Well, I can try on the Instant Booking. I'm not sure I can shed too much light on it. Our rationale for kind of the more complete rollout on the phone was made as much on the user experience is just so much better on the phone with Instant Booking that the click-off model, regardless of whether it was going to be revenue positive or negative for us, we just needed to get there, learn our way, optimize the conversion path, which is what we did. And part of the gains that we've seen are -- on the phone in terms of monetization and active usage is probably related to the Instant Booking, but we never kept a control group out there to really know exactly how much the Instant Booking drove our monetization improvement on the phone. So for desktop tablet, we are being a lot more careful about it because monetization is one way that we look at measuring the success of it. At the moment, I'd say the deliberate rollout is less on the monetization factor and more on the -- we want a bunch of partners in the store and with the ones that we have signed, that's a set of meaningful additions so that our consumers will be able to find good pricing, great availability as they go through the Instant Booking process. We're still limited to the U.S., as I'm sure you understand, and so we'll make sure that we'll do our best to get that going before we look at a much broader rollout.","Julie M. B. Bradley","On the clicks per shopper side, last year, as we were rolling out metasearch, clicks per shopper decreased significantly throughout the rollout and then stabilized once we were at 100%. And if I look at our exit rates for 2013 and compare it to the averages in 2014, kind of neutralizing seasonality, up a little in the first half of the year, down a little in the second half of the year, we're pretty close to our exit rates coming out of 2013.","Operator","I'd like to turn the call back over to Steve Kaufer for closing remarks.","Stephen Kaufer","Well, thank you. Everyone, we feel we have a tremendous number of exciting opportunities ahead of us. We've talked about many of them in the call, but it's very exciting to see the entire TripAdvisor story come together in terms of planning all the different aspects of a trip with our acquisitions in the restaurants and attractions category.","I really want to welcome the new teams to the family, and thank all of the TripAdvisor media group employees for the remarkable efforts that it takes everyone on the team to make this stuff happen.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Will Lyons. Sir, you may begin.","Will Lyons","Thank you, Sam. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to TripAdvisor's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Will Lyons, Senior Director of Investor Relations for TripAdvisor, and joining me on the call today are our CEO, Steve Kaufer; and our CFO, Julie Bradley.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the estimates and other forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's views as of today, October 23, 2013. TripAdvisor disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. Please refer to today's earnings release and TripAdvisor's filing with the SEC for information concerning factors that would cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","You'll also find reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures discussed on this call in our Q3 earnings release, which is available on our IR site, ir.tripadvisor.com.","Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense and technology and content expense exclude stock-based compensation and all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2012.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve.","Stephen Kaufer","Thank you, Will, and welcome, everyone. I'm going to take a few minutes and highlight some key metrics and discuss notable developments on our technology and growth initiatives. Julie will then review our financials and outlook before we take your questions.","First, some of the numbers. Hotel shoppers grew a healthy 37% during Q3, as we saw solid growth across our core and emerging markets. This drove 13% click-based revenue growth for the period, a quarter in which we saw the biggest negative impact from our meta transition.","Our display business continued its solid 2013, accelerating nicely to 29% growth, based upon global sales traction and product differentiation. And our subscription, transaction and other revenue line saw a very healthy 68% growth.","It's worth noting that the strong total revenue growth came without much, if any, contribution from our new TV ad campaign, which we began testing in Q2 and rolled out more broadly in the U.S. and targeted international markets at the end of September. As a result, adjusted EBITDA came in better than we had anticipated, as the bulk of our expected TV marketing spend has shifted into the fourth quarter.","Most importantly, we continued strengthening our position in the travel planning funnel, making progress on a number of ongoing initiatives aimed at growing our community and user-generated content, amplifying our brand throughout the globe, as well as improving the TripAdvisor experience for users and partners alike.","I'll now touch upon some interesting developments in a few of these growth initiatives. First, I'll discuss how we are growing 3 key assets: Our traffic, our content and our brand on a global scale.","In terms of traffic, hotel shopper growth, as measured by our logs, remains solid. When including our exceptionally fast-growing traffic to our restaurants and attraction pages, our sites averaged 260 million monthly unique visitors in Q3, up 59%. We expanded our reach in Latin America, rolling out 4 new TripAdvisor domains in localized Spanish language: Peru, Colombia, Chile and Venezuela.","We're also working on a desktop site refresh that places greater emphasis on TripAdvisor's huge loyal travel community and user-generated content across all of our points of sale.","As for content growth, our more than 57 million email-able members are generating content at an accelerated rate of more than 80 contributions per minute, pushing our total reviews and opinions to more than 125 million.","In addition to our deep, rich reviews, TripAdvisor users love candid travel photos and we have more than 17 million of them, up 70% year-on-year. We supplemented that recently by acquiring oyster.com, a hotel review website featuring reviews and photos covering thousands of properties in more than 150 cities.","On the brand side, I alluded to our new TV ad campaign, which highlights a recognizable aspect of our user-generated content, our iconic bubble ratings. The ad kicked off nationally at the end of September, concurrent to testing the original TV ad in targeted European and South American markets. We are seeing some positive signs from this campaign, but it's too early to gauge the overall effectiveness.","We were also very pleased to announce a partnership with American Express, our first major on-site affinity program, which brings additional functionality to card members in the U.S., U.K. and Australia.","In addition, we entered into a partnership with European publishing powerhouse, Axel Springer, to create a new digital -- a new German digital travel magazine.","These 2 wins will increase brand awareness, drive user stickiness and nicely complement our ongoing robust Certificate of Excellence and Travelers' Choice award campaigns, as we strive to achieve brand ubiquity all around the globe.","Secondly, as it relates to how we're making the TripAdvisor experience that much better for users and partners alike, I'll highlight meta, mobile and TripConnect.","On the first topic, meta, since we rolled this out to 100% of our traffic in early June, we've driven more clicks per meta session and better downstream partner conversion. And although pricing remains choppy, we've seen a modest uptick in meta revenue per session. We continue to work on improving on-site and partner conversion, running multiple tests every week and we expect more gains in this area.","For partners, coverage is strong and bidding frequency is up. Specifically, we've seen the majority of our top partners bidding at least weekly and many of them as frequent as 2x or 3x per week. We are working to make the bid recommendations we send more actionable, which will give partners additional insight and flexibility in their campaigns. We are also now providing an expanded suite of reports, including a report to help them bid on our mobile traffic, which continues to grow at a fast pace.","More specific to mobile growth, we had more than 108 million average monthly users on tablet and phone, approaching 40% of our total traffic and reaching more than 69 million cumulative app downloads.","Our roadmap on these devices is simple. Help the traveler find exactly what they need to make -- exactly what they need to make an informed travel decision faster.","On the tablet side, our recent app design refresh looks great and makes it a lot easier for travelers to find the hotel that they're looking for. The upgrade has performed well, delivering an estimated 20% uptick on tablet app revenue. We plan to roll out the new design to tablet web traffic soon and are hoping for a revenue uptick there as well.","On the phone side, we are thrilled with the release of our new native Android and iPhone apps, as they are hitting the mark in terms of delivering fast results and pleasing design, giving the user an overall much better experience.","Also, our pre-install partnership with Samsung has provided a nice bump to mobile app usage, with an average of 7 million monthly unique app users on GALAXY S4 during the quarter. The native app launches and the Samsung partnerships are part of Phase 2 on our team's roadmap to materially improve the smartphone user experience. Phase 1 was adding meta hotel price comparison late last year. Phase 2 included refreshing the user interface and writing native apps on iOS and Android for speed and design. Phase 3 includes translating the app design components to the phone. And Phase 4, starting sometime in 2014, will aim to remove friction from the booking process, allowing travelers to make a reservation while staying on TripAdvisor.","In our opinion, the current handoff to partners on the phone is, in a word, painful, especially when users want to go back and forth as they explore different partners' booking options. We believe it is absolutely imperative to deliver a better experience on the phone for our travelers. By reducing that friction, travelers will have the opportunity to pick a property, choose a room type and finish the reservation without leaving TripAdvisor.","To be clear, we are not becoming an OTA. We greatly prefer the media model and are happy to facilitate a reservation while our partners fulfill the request, especially if it leads to a smoother, more enjoyable user experience on TripAdvisor.","We believe this could be one of those delightful win, win, win scenarios, as we expect to drive a cleaner and more enjoyable user experience, better conversion for our partners and improved smartphone monetization.","The magnitude of the monetization improvement remains unclear. However, given that hotel shoppers on smartphone continue to grow in excess of 100%, we see this reduction of friction to help travelers finish their reservations as a meaningful opportunity in 2014.","Finally, as for the third topic, our new TripConnect platform. For the first time, we're enabling independent hoteliers to advertise their rates and availability to our massive travel audience. At this point, we partnered with over 260 Internet booking engines, or IBEs, representing approximately 200,000 independent properties. Over 70 IBEs have completed the integration which, as of last week, allows more than 40,000 hoteliers to sign up and start bidding for leads.","These smaller independent properties, many of whom have never been part of an OTA, can now appear in our availability results, advertising their room rates and availability to our massive global audience. We think this is another win, win, win scenario, in which the traveler gets more choice, a new segment of hoteliers get access to that traveler and TripAdvisor gets better commerce coverage and another bidder in our auction, which helps our conversion numbers.","The TripConnect rollout also includes an adapted Review Express product for hoteliers, allowing them to engage guests by automatically generating post-stay review solicitation emails. This is a great improvement over the current manual version, which is already being used by more than 30,000 business owners around the globe. Review Express will help hoteliers engage guests on a more frequent basis, adding more fresh, valuable content about their properties on TripAdvisor, which in turns helps drive audience and leads -- helps drives audience and leads to our powerful network effects. TripConnect is an exciting addition to the Business Listing product suite and the entire team has continued to execute well this year.","We also have a new leadership at the helm, as we appointed Marc Charron as President of TripAdvisor for Business after his successful 3 years as Managing Director of our Asia-Pacific region.","Switching gears a bit to our Vacation Rental business. Vacation Rentals are an increasingly popular accommodation choice and our more than 400,000 property listings are a nice complement to our 758,000 hotels and B&Bs and specialty lodging on our site.","Our experience over the past year is that adding a free-to-list, pay only when the consumer books option for the homeowner, in addition to the subscription option, has allowed us to significantly improve the traveler and homeowner experience. We have reduced the friction to list for the homeowner. It's just amazing what the word \"free\" can do. And by doing so, we have dramatically improved the selection of properties available to the traveler.","We're also just about to add Niumba's excellent Spanish inventory, which puts us over 500,000 Vacation Rental listings on TripAdvisor. We think that Vacation Rentals is a business that begs for the kind of scale and demand that we can bring to the equation. And we are looking at additional opportunities to consolidate even more supply in this fragmented, fast-growing market.","In summary, we've made some nice progress on our various growth initiatives this quarter and have some exciting initiatives in place that we think will help us better match more travelers with our partners and improve monetization.","I'll now turn the call over to Julie, who will provide some color on the financial results, as well as our outlook for the balance of 2013.","Julie M. B. Bradley","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Third quarter revenue grew 20%, driven by continued strong hotel shopper growth in our click-based business, as well as notable strength in display and continued strong subscription and transaction and other revenue.","Currency provided a 1.5% tailwind to total revenue this quarter. Adjusted EBITDA growth slowed to negative 2% versus positive 15% in the year ago quarter.","Specific to geographic mix. Revenue from international points of sale was 53% of total revenue during the quarter, which represents a more normalized state versus Q2, when we saw the impact of the country-by-country phased meta rollout. International revenue growth continues to outpace domestic revenue growth, with Q3 international revenue up 25%. This growth is driven primarily by rapid hotel shopper growth globally and strong performance of our display and Business Listings products overseas. International hotel shoppers were up 41%, with LatAm representing our fastest-growing region at 54% hotel shopper growth.","In terms of revenue by product, click-based revenue grew 13%. This was driven by hotel shopper growth of 37%, offset by 3 headwinds: 9% to 12% from the meta transition and, approximately, 5% to 10% each from our strong smartphone and the international growth.","Drilling down a bit on mobile. Tablet and phone revenue contributed nearly 15% of total click-based revenue, with unique users on phone up more than 200% year-to-date. We see a distinct opportunity to reduce friction and improve monetization on that device.","Display-based revenue growth accelerated for the third straight quarter to 29%, ahead of our full year expectations. This is due to better sell-through rates on a global basis. Our client count increased 21% in Q3, primarily driven by new business in APAC and EMEA and an improved rebooking rate in the Americas. In particular, we're seeing nice traction with destination marketing organizations, hoteliers, airlines and more recently, financial buyers, as these advertisers seek to leverage TripAdvisor's global consumer reach.","Subscription, transaction and other revenue, which includes Business Listing, Vacation Rentals and our transaction businesses, delivered 68% growth, ahead of our full year expectations for those businesses. We attribute this solid performance to continued Business Listings sales traction, as well as increased inventory and a better user experience in Vacation Rentals.","On the expense side, our aggressive hiring pace continued in Q3, as we pursued our product, platform and global growth initiative. Marketing cost increased versus last quarter to prepare a new ad creative for our TV campaign, which started running at the end of September and added people and advisors to support that campaign and increase our spend in a variety of traffic acquisition channels. As such, the vast majority of our TV spend budget will be concentrated in Q4, as we continue with our domestic spend and expand the campaign to more international markets.","Moving on to taxes. Our Q3 GAAP effective tax rate of 33% increased sequentially, primarily due to normal true-ups of estimates as a result of filing our 2012 tax returns, as well as some changes in full year forecasted geographic mix. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate for the full year to be towards the upper end of our previously provided guidance of mid- to high-20s.","Cash flow from operating activities grew 90% to $145 million, well ahead of our normalized run rate. The year-over-year increase is primarily due to the application of prior year tax overpayments and the timing of customers' receipts for future hotel and Vacation Rental space versus the payments to hoteliers and Vacation Rental owners, which are tracked in our deferred merchant payable. We would expect these 2 items to have a positive impact on full year cash flow.","CapEx for the quarter was $15.7 million or 6% of revenue, consistent with our full year guidance. Approximately half of our full year CapEx plan is related to capitalized engineering salaries and the balance is driven by data center expansion needs on higher traffic and leasehold improvements in several new and existing offices.","From a liquidity standpoint, we ended the quarter with $596 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities. This does not include approximately $40 million from marketable securities that settle after quarter end. At the end of the quarter, we had outstanding borrowings of $350 million, as well as an undrawn credit facility of $200 million.","Finally, in terms of capital allocation, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock for approximately $100 million.","With that, let me provide updated thoughts on our 2013 outlook. We are reiterating our total revenue growth expectation of low-20s for the full year. For click-based revenue, the CPC bidding landscape continues to mature and we are facing increasingly tough traffic comps due to SEO improvements in the back half of 2012 and into early 2013. As a result, we are lowering our full year 2013 expectation for click-based revenue growth to mid- to high-teens.","Based on our strong results through the 9 months, we are raising our display-based revenue outlook to high-teens to low-20s growth for the full year, but we no longer expect Q4 to have the strongest growth rate.","For subscription, transaction and other business lines, we continue to expect high-50s growth for the full year and see more upside opportunity than downside risk to that forecast. Remember that our click-based business is highly sensitive to fluctuations in hotel shopper growth and partner CPC pricing, both of which are risks, especially to our click-based revenue line.","On the flip side, neither our results to date nor our 2013 forecast including -- include any meaningful traffic or repeat visitor lift from our TV ad campaign. So that may represent some potential upside from a traffic or revenue standpoint moving forward.","On the subscription, transaction and other revenue line, remember that the traction in our Vacation Rental free-to-list product, as well as our flash sales product, will have seasonality similar to our click-based revenue, where Q3 is seasonally the strongest quarter and Q4 is seasonally the weakest.","Also note that the independent hoteliers using our TripConnect product must purchase a Business Listing subscription, which will continue to be reflected in our subscription, transaction and other revenue line, while the cost per click lead that we send to the independent hotelier will be captured in our click-based revenue line.","Finally, on the expense side, our investment objectives and hiring plans remain relatively unchanged. Given our 13% EBITDA growth year-to-date and the fact that our TV spend will be materially higher during the fourth quarter than in the previously 2 quarters, we are maintaining our full year 2013 EBITDA growth expectation of mid-single digits.","We will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wondering on the updated guidance on click-based advertising. It seems like if you were to be able to do the revenue growth on that line item that you did just in the third quarter alone, you could have gotten to the low end of the old guidance. So are you expecting that, that potentially to come in, further slowing in the fourth quarter? And then, I guess as you look at the drivers there, how much of that is just the tougher comp on hotel shopper growth? And how much of that is stability or lack thereof in the metasearch auction? Is there still a lot of movement going on among the key players? Or do you feel like they've figured out what they need to do and the metasearch drag will thus be reduced as we go forward?","Julie M. B. Bradley","Sure. But first, I just want to reiterate what the guidance was originally. It was the high-teens to low-20s. And we've moved it down to mid- to high-teens, really citing from the hotel shopper side that we have some SEO -- tough SEO comps continuing in the fourth quarter and into 2013. And we're also still seeing some of those other headwinds that I called out between mobile, international and...","Stephen Kaufer","Meta.","Julie M. B. Bradley","And meta, which kind of gets us more into a mid- to high-teens range for the full year.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then just on the metasearch auctions, do you see the drag decreasing in the fourth quarter? And how much of a drag -- how long do you think that drag will continue to be a headwind into next year?","Stephen Kaufer","So I guess there's a piece of that answer that we have some influence on and a piece that we really don't. So I look at it as, what can I do for on-site conversion of folks entering that meta funnel? And we had made some progress in the past quarter, not as much as I had originally hoped for, but again some progress. We continue on a weekly basis to do things and think of it as every other week, we find another small win and so they keep adding up. I have no reason to believe that we won't continue to see additional, small incremental wins throughout Q4 as we get better and better at optimizing conversion. I certainly don't think that we're done, we found everything that there is. The perhaps higher level of optimism that I had at -- in our last call, in terms of what we would be able to do in Q3, has led me to be a little more cautious about my optimism of what we could accomplish in Q3 that we didn't quite deliver on in terms of improving that meta conversion experience, has led me to be more cautious about expecting even higher gains in Q4. If they come, great, we're -- it doesn't change our actions. The other half that relates to meta monetization is what pricing does. And so clearly, our -- most of our clients are still experimenting frequently with the auction. We expect that to continue, think of it as forever, as people adjust their bids up and down. And in my remarks, I referred to it as choppy because it's hard for them to figure out the dynamics as they change -- as one client changes their bids and then it affects others and vice versa. And it's just -- we just think of it as a fluid environment. I'm comfortable that most of the major players are now bidding intelligently. They're very active. The game is on in almost all cases. So the slow adoption by a couple of our partners, that issue is, in my view, mostly going away. And we have an active bidding system. I'm not, in the fourth quarter, projecting a price increase or a price decrease on average because I have no indication one way or the other that clients will bid up or down. So for want of better information, I'm thinking pricing is neutral, conversion will be up a little bit and that's how we build our forecast. It's all subject, unfortunately, from my perspective, from my forecasting perspective, to a lot of conditions that are just beyond my control.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nat Schindler of Bank of America.","Nathaniel H. Schindler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","When going with the meta neutrality -- your getting to monetization neutrality with meta, your customers are all very experienced ROI-based marketers. You basically moved down the conversion funnel. Why wouldn't that follow a very efficient curve? And would I have to say that the advertisers were paying too much before on click-based or too little now?","Stephen Kaufer","Great question and one we wrestle with when we think, Hey, wait a minute, I have apples-to-apples number of travelers, we changed the interface, but they're still, at the end of the day, going to book the same number of hotels because I haven't fundamentally changed anything. So why are we making less money than we were before, if you assume that clients are bidding at the same efficiency level, if I could paraphrase your question. I think part of it comes down to, when we were sending a lot of clicks over to our clients in the old pop-up mechanism, we were actually spawning lots of windows and lots of sites. And perhaps, TripAdvisor was getting some credit for transactions that didn't happen at that point in time. If I try to remember my own remarks from a couple of years ago, pre-meta, when I was talking about why I didn't think the meta model would monetize as well as our old model, I referred to the fact that we actually sent a lot of traffic. And some of that traffic would buy arguably not what was intended, if you will. So a click over to a Hilton hotel on Expedia would end up buying an airplane ticket somewhere. And now the click over to Expedia is only happening when they like the price that they've seen for that Hilton property. So it's much more qualified and less likely to perhaps buy something else. So maybe we were getting a little bit more credit for something that we didn't get before, or maybe we were getting more credit before than we're getting now in terms of attribution. The other use case that we certainly note is, on TripAdvisor today with our meta experience, you can check the prices. You can find everything you need. And then you go home, you check with your spouse. And then maybe you go direct to the OTA or the chain to book. And the OTA is still getting the booking. The traveler is still making the reservation. But that connection between the research experience on TripAdvisor over to the OTA isn't trackable anymore. So we call that leakage in our system. And we believe the meta experience has more leakage than the pop-up system. Because the pop-up, to get the price, you had to pop up an Expedia or Booking or anyone else. And if you went back an hour later, domain direct to those sites, we would get credit for that transaction. Now we don't because we don't have that window appearing. So I think it's a nicely complicated way of saying that the meta experience all by itself has more leakage, we believe, than the old pop-up experience. And we're betting, certainly over time, that the fact that it is so much more of an enjoyable experience, travelers will come back to TripAdvisor to do their research more frequently and will more than make up for the increased leakage with increased visitor rate, but that will take some time.","Nathaniel H. Schindler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just a follow-up actually on something you had said on your last call about traffic issues and you -- I think you mentioned in August at an investor conference persisting. You still came in with very high total traffic growth and you've decelerated only slightly on hotel shopper growth. Are you seeing any macro issue on travelers?","Stephen Kaufer","I wouldn't say that there was any big macro event this past quarter that I would cite as materially affecting us. Our overall traffic growth, I expect to continue some pretty high numbers as our attraction and restaurant and Vacation Rental traffic continues to grow in extremely strong ways. As you know, we don't monetize that as well, but it remains an incredible undermonetized, underutilized asset that we have that so many people on so many devices are using TripAdvisor far beyond hotels. And so that's -- it's a nice long-term piece of our puzzle. When you look at 260 million uniques and at 60% or 59% year-on-year growth rate, oh, my gosh, that's really big and are really big numbers. So the law of big numbers will say that will decelerate at some point, but it's still adding at such a rate, building up such a nice asset. But again, we call out hotel shopper specifically because that's more relevant to our financials.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dean Prissman of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dean Prissman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So with TripConnect, are there any financial incentives you're considering for your booking engine partners to help them, say, sell Business Listings or even generate ad budgets? And then on the moderation in the year-over-year declines from Expedia revenue, can you comment on the cadence? So was the trend observed throughout the quarter or pronounced at a particular point? And then secondly, any comment on whether activity from brand Expedia or Hotels.com was more of a factor?","Stephen Kaufer","So I really don't like to comment on individual client behaviors. So I'll have to take a pass on that one. I did say that all of our big clients are very active on our system now. So whereas a couple of quarters ago I had said that, there were some that were slower to adapt. We don't have that issue anymore, by and large. In terms of the financial -- offering financial incentive to Internet booking engines, we don't actually feel that we need to at this point. Most -- or many, I should say, of these Internet booking engines make money by charging a small transaction fee to the hoteliers. And so anytime they can find a vehicle that helps drive more website bookings for them, they are going to make money as part of that transaction, frankly. So we find most of the IBEs extremely cooperative and very interested in helping their client base, the hotelier, get up to speed and bid on our platform. Again, we think they're making money, if not just providing a good service to the individual hoteliers. The 200-plus sign-ups is a really -- it's a very meaningful percentage. We don't have total figures, but near as we can tell, a very meaningful percentage of all of the IBE players out there and the fact that they've committed to working with us and the only reason it's not 200 certified partners at this point is that, hey, there is some development work that they have to schedule. So they're committed. It's going to happen. We'll have these couple of hundred thousand independent hoteliers and hopefully more over time able to participate in the system. And that's the overall beauty of TripConnect as it adds so many more potential players. We don't think financial incentives are at all necessary to help that along.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Purcell of Stifel.","Michael B. Purcell - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I'd like to talk a little bit more about the user engagement. The 37% traffic growth, I was wondering if you could give us some cadence if that did accelerate through the quarter and just geography-wise, if that is -- if you're seeing any difference there? And secondly, on the last call, you gave us some updates about the view pages per session is up 10% and bounce rate. I was wondering if you'd just give us any updates on that.","Stephen Kaufer","Sure. So I start with some of the phone because that was the most exciting, post-quarter, I should add, as we rolled out the native apps right at the end of the quarter or early October. And we've seen the expected increased engagement from the native. So we're certainly pleased with that. I don't have an update for you on page views per session or bounce rate. From memory, on the traffic growth, the 37% hotel shopper growth, I believe it was kind of the rest of world growing the fastest. U.S. held their own in terms of growth. If I recall, Europe in terms of hotel shoppers, was weaker in terms of year-on-year growth rate than the U.S. I hesitate a little bit in throwing those out because I don't really know how -- offhand, how they were comparing to previous quarter. So I'm not sure I can help you draw some interesting overall conclusions from that. We do measure bounce rate and page views per session, repeat visit rate and the like. And I don't have anything sort of meaningful to report on those numbers at the moment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Devitt of Morgan Stanley.","Scott W. Devitt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Steve, in 2012, the gap in hotel shoppers and CPC revenue was driven by site redesign and traffic quality and I think mobile, international and Expedia pricing as well. And then as we transitioned into this year, the gap has been mobile and international and meta. And so it seems like now that those 3 are potentially going to continue into 2014. And I was just wondering if you could speak to whether or not you foresee any other potential headwinds as it relates to monetization as we approach '14. And then as it relates to the 3 that you're facing this year, how you think of those in terms of being structural versus transitional given the length of time that they've impeded revenue growth?","Stephen Kaufer","Sure, excellent question. So in terms of those mobile, international and meta. Meta, I think we will continue to make modest improvements as we continue to work on conversion, but maybe slower going than I would have liked. But that one goes away when we lap. So hey, by June, we'll have rolled out 100% and so we won't be facing that headwind anymore. And I don't see a particular reason why that would reemerge as a headwind. International growth, no, we would continue to expect international growth to remain a modest headwind as we continue to grow. As the countries get bigger and more online, the CPCs tend to rise. It doesn't always work that way, but I would put that in the modest headwind category for the next several years. And then mobile, I'm not sure to what extent the reducing the friction, helping to complete the reservation on the phone is going to offset the faster phone growth than desktop tablet. So mobile will be -- will continue to be a headwind because it's growing so much faster than anything else, more than desktop certainly, but it should be less of a headwind for us because we'll be able to take all of our current traffic and the future growth traffic. And we expect to have a monetization improvement on that score. So yes, a headwind, but a decreasing level of headwind, if you will.","Scott W. Devitt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And would you envision bringing direct booking from mobile back to desktop, like what you had done with metasearch?","Stephen Kaufer","I'm talking about figuring it out on the phone because the phone is really the pain point where the back and forth on the consumer, on the phone -- you open it up, the TripAdvisor app, you look around. You say, Wow, searching in a city for a hotel, great hotel, love the photos, love the this, love the that, found a great price. Click over and you land on booking.com or an Expedia or Hotels.com or Travelocity or -- and then, Hey, I want to check the next rate. And you're kind of lost a bit. You have to -- I mean, when we watch our users, they struggle with getting back to TripAdvisor. And we feel that's the key reason why we're not monetizing as well on the phone. Plus we don't let someone finish the transaction, so they click off. And then, again, they go home and instead of opening up the app again, they go directly to the site that they saw the price and they book. So we lose the credit there. Finishing the reservation on the phone allows us to plug both of those holes. And so if we have a serious hotel shopper on the phone, and we do, we believe we do, and we see other folks report meaningful bookings on the phone, not just people looking, we think we can sort of capture that demand. The need is less on the desktop because you click on the button. It opens a new window. And that's fine. You click on the next button, it opens a new window. You don't have the experience of completely losing the context. So we'll see how it works for us on the phone. We'll see what user reactions are. We're very protective of our unbiased perspective, or our unbiased brand reputation on the part of consumers, so we don't want to be seen as just pushing one particular supplier or going -- we'd never go exclusive in a market, that sort of thing. So we want to maintain our site, where you can do your price comparison and do a reservation through a number of different vehicles on the phone. And again, I'll pass on the question of whether that makes it to the desktop or tablet or not. Phone is where our head is at.","Operator","Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan.","Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just wanted to ask you about CPC trends, in particular by geography, and if you're seeing any material differences there. And then did you, I may have missed it, but did you give an expectation on when you think you can achieve revenue parity under meta?","Stephen Kaufer","So I'm no longer talking about a timeframe that I'm going to achieve revenue neutrality on meta because I'm not thinking about it that way anymore. I'm looking at on a weekly basis. We're making conversion improvements. And I'm not sure I can even measure what true revenue neutrality looks like anymore. So it is what it is. We're not moving back. We'll comp over it. And we're -- and the appropriate question, if you will, each quarter might be, Hey, so how many points of conversion improvement do you think you can get over the next quarter or how many did you get over the last quarter sort of thing. And to answer that now, I said, Hey, we made a smaller-than-expected conversion improvement in Q3. And we still think that there is improvement we can make in Q4. We don't think we've tapped the low-hanging fruit. The CPC trends by geography, this is a little bit from memory here, but U.S., Canada, Australia, probably pretty strong markets. Southern Europe, still weak in terms of overall CPCs. I'm not sure that, that's going to change in the coming quarters just because of the overall economic situation. I don't see big clients missing. I don't see big potential changes that happened in the last 2 months that would make me predict something is going to change in the next 2 months that would sort of fundamentally cause any one market to be particularly strong or particularly weak. And we'll we chat again in the next quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom White of Macquarie.","Thomas C. White - Macquarie Research","Steve, I think intra quarter you made some comments that suggested you guys might roll out your brand marketing campaign internationally more, add additional countries throughout next year. Maybe can you give a little bit of color on how broad that might be and, if possible, put some numbers to it? And then just on the question -- the prior questions about CPC trends for sort of outside the U.S. I know it's kind of hard to isolate, I guess, what's been happening with those independent of this meta change. But as we look out across 2014, what do you think is the best way for us to assess whether that kind of pricing headwind from some of these newer markets may be closing or that delta might be closing relative to U.S. CPC pricing? Is it just kind of changes in ADRs in those markets or are there other factors?","Stephen Kaufer","Excellent question. I'll take each in turn. So the brand marketing and the national rollout, let's see, we're very big in the U.S. now. In Europe, we've been testing in Spain and France. We do -- when we think TV, we do think global. As you have to create a TV ad, it's a little hard to create -- we found it hard to create one that would instantly work and be testable in every market. So there's, as you can imagine, additional production cost, depending on the markets that you seek. We picked a few different markets because we wanted to see if we'd be able to measure a benefit that would come in a market as small for us as Argentina versus as large as us for the U.S. And so it's quite possible -- I'm not saying we're doing this, I'm just saying it's quite possible -- that we will choose to continue to -- we will continue TV in 2014 in markets where we need strong awareness and go light in markets where we're already particularly strong or vice versa. There's -- given how global we are, there's so many different places that we are going to have to make some strategic tradeoffs in the market. I don't have any numbers to share because we haven't set those ourselves because we don't have results yet from the current tests. So it's -- I remain cautiously optimistic about television having a meaningful effect on the business. We do have to take a longer-term view. I'm not interested in testing at the level that we've been out in Q4, expanded to all markets throughout 2014. That would sort of kill us. And we really wouldn't have a lot of logic behind that. That's why we did a test. That's why we're testing now. That's why we're heavy in the markets that we chose so we can see the effect. And from that, we'll be able to pick out some numbers and then hone in on individual markets next year. I'd give you the -- perhaps the insight, we'll just say a comment on the way we think about the television for next year will be to set aside some funds. And they'll be fungible in terms of, we're not going to approach it as we have x budget so we are going to spend it by definition. We'll continue to iterate and test and perhaps some of that testing will be in markets that we haven't been in before. Perhaps if we like the results in our current markets, we'll continue there. But it will still be subject to change. And we may or may not breakout TV spend specifically from other sales and marketing expenditures over the course of next year. We wanted to tell you this year because it was big. It was material. It was something we had never done before. And in another quarter, I'll give you my best guess, or my best take, on how it worked for us and the logic of roughly the -- how we're thinking of continuing that in 2014. To the CPCs outside the U.S., the best way to monitor how our international monetization gap would be, it's -- I'm a little stumped because we're just not sharing enough information on the breakout in the international market of where our traffic and clicks are coming from. To the degree that you can get other information from other online travel agencies as to how well they're doing in a particular market, I would naturally expect some level of similarity if a particular OTA is doing well, commanding high margins, et cetera. That generally means that they can afford to pay us more as a lead source. So that's an indication of pricing. Australia is a good market. It's a rich market. And the prices are strong, whereas some of the newer LatAm markets, there's not a lot of online -- there's not as many online transactions happening there so prices tend to be lower, no surprise. Sorry if that's not a particularly helpful answer to you, but I can't, offhand, think of anything better.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.","Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to ask one quick question on TripConnect. Have you noticed any increase tensions pushback from some of your larger OTA partners with the rollout of that product? And Steve, I know you mentioned some statistics in there about properties that have never been involved with any OTAs in the past. But nonetheless, as you do this, have you noticed anything that has encouraged you or discouraged you in terms of the timing and the strength of which you roll out TripConnect?","Stephen Kaufer","Mark, good question. No, we really haven't had a pushback from our OTA clients. While somebody that's not an OTA client bidding on a new property probably wouldn't notice, wouldn't care, they might well ask, Hey, if this adds another bidder to the auction, that might not be good for me, the OTA. But you have to remember, we have a lot of OTAs in our auction already. So adding one more player, in most markets, there's lots of players. So it helps, from our perspective, in pricing. But it's not, from an OTA perspective, a particular sort of meaningful. By point of comparison, hey, we could sign up another OTA that has 20,000 properties to add. And boom, in one day, all of a sudden, 20,000 more properties have competition. It will take us a long time to sign up 20,000 more individual hoteliers who are all managing their self-service CPC bids. So in the scheme of adding competition, sure, it adds some competition. In the scheme of OTAs losing click share, that's a little further down the road to see. And OTAs are absolutely used to competing with each other on our site. They're used to competing directly with the hotel chain on our site. They're used to, in a small degree, competing with independents who are represented by aggregators before because we always had some of those. And so adding thousands or tens of thousands of more independent hotels bidding probably isn't moving the needle for them one way or the other. Maybe it's just a very long-winded way of saying, I'm sure they knew this was coming, like competition comes in all markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS.","Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","This was the first quarter where Expedia and Priceline sort of had their owned and operated meta properties inside their own companies. Did you see anything from either a bidding perspective or a budget perspective that might have changed now that Expedia owns Trivago and Priceline owns Kayak and so how that might continue to develop going forward into 2014?","Stephen Kaufer","Eric, that's an interesting question. No, we haven't heard anything from clients that indicate their bidding behavior or budgets on TripAdvisor have changed because of this. I say that, knowing full well that why would they tell me if anything had changed. But the behavior we see on the day-to-day client relationship continues to be, we're optimizing our bids on TripAdvisor, how can we get more traffic? Our efficiencies are better, I can add my bids a little more. Hey, TripAdvisor what should I do? Oh, my efficiencies are going in the wrong direction, I need to cut back. Where can I reallocate? It's a partnership. There's a lot of dialogue back and forth. And I'm not even sure of the overlap in terms of the people that we deal with at our big clients, are they the same individuals that are bidding on our metasearch competitors? I suspect, in most cases, they're not. So we're not seeing a -- certainly, we're not seeing a budget shift and we're not seeing any other behavioral shifts that I can articulate.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just one question on mobile. You've talked about the direct mobile booking solution to kind of help with the fumbling of the handoff issue. How widespread will that direct mobile bookings path be? Like, does it take time to roll out to a broad portion of inventory? Or what are kind of the restrictions or limitations for rolling that out?","Stephen Kaufer","So I -- great question. It will certainly roll out over time. It's a new set of flows to make the reservation on TripAdvisor as opposed to just click off. So we have to develop all that. It's a new piece of connectivity with our partners that we need to develop. I'd make the clear distinction between what we're doing on the phone and what we just went through with the classic or pop-up windows over to meta because that transition was truly a, Hey, guys, it's coming. Hey, it's coming. Better get on board. Better get on board. We're launched and you're not participating. And because it was a sort of a big bang launch, you had -- you, the client, had to move from classic over to meta or you just weren't being shown on our site. Whereas the move on the phone to help our travelers finish the booking, or finish the reservation, is not changing anyone's ability to continue to bid for traffic exactly as they're doing now. So you could hypothetically say, Well, hey Steve, if you had one hotel chain, you could roll it out. And that's right. I could. I don't think we'll do it that way, just guessing into the future because we'll want a more robust product offering with more than just one hotel chain as a end provider. But in theory, we could do that because they're not disruptive to all the other bidding and all the other dynamics. It's just -- it's adding another option for the traveler, who doesn't want to click off and just wants to complete the reservation while in the Trip app or Trip mobile experience. Having said all that, clearly, we believe it's the right thing to do. We'll be eager to get as much participation from as many clients as possible. This is kind of news to a lot of folks. And we're eager to chat with as many as we can to have them participate in our launch of this when we pick a timeframe.","Operator","Thank you.

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to TripAdvisor's Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Will Lyons. Please go ahead. ","Will Lyons","Thanks, Gigi. Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Steve Kaufer, our CEO; and Ernst Teunissen, our CFO. Last night after market close, we distributed our Q4 and full year 2017 earnings release. We made available our prepared remarks in our Investor Relations website located at ir.tripadvisor.com.","In the release, you will find reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures discussed on this call. You will also find supplemental information which includes certain non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call as well as other performance metrics.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that this call may contain estimates and other forward-looking statements that represent the company's views as of today, February 15, 2018. TripAdvisor disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. Please refer to our earnings release and our filings with the SEC for information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.","And with that, I'll pass the call to Steve. ","Steve Kaufer","Thank you, Will, and good morning, everyone.","Q4 capped a year of important progress on our long-term growth initiatives and we've been taking important steps to preserve EBITDA while also investing for future growth. Our market opportunity is huge and we know we still have a lot of work to do. It is incumbent upon us to execute and unlock this growth potential.","With that, we now open up your call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Mark Mahaney from RBC. Your line is now open.","Mark Mahaney","If I can ask two questions, please. Your outlook calls for hotel revenue to be lower in 2018. Could you talk about some of the assumptions behind that? And do you think that that's going to be driven more by a lower number of hotel shoppers, lower amount of revenue per hotel shoppers? So just peel that back a little bit.","And then if I could just ask broadly, could you discuss your relations with your two largest customers now, Priceline and Expedia? Anything you would say about how that relationship has trended over the last year or two and how you think about that going forwards? Thank you.","Ernst Teunissen","I'll start with the first part of the question and Steve can take the second part. Our assumptions for next year, an important - two important drivers, is one, in the front half of the year, we are not yet lapping the bid-downs that we saw in Q3, and that's going to give additional pressure on growth rates in the front half until we lap that in the second half.","The second important driver is our marketing investments. As we said in our prepared remarks, we're pulling back in the hotel on our total marketing investments, increased TV, but decrease our online marketing. And that is going to resolve in additional pressure on the top line growth but is helping the bottom line, because we\u2019re cutting marginal unprofitable spend.","So those are the two most important drivers. And the reason why they work more in the \u2013 more significantly on the first half of the year than on the second half of the year.","Steve Kaufer","Our relationships with our biggest customers, our big OTAs, Priceline and Expedia Group, I would characterize as excellent. They like the traffic we send. They help us identify and qualify even better traffic for them. We drive a reasonable number of bookings. It's strong, notwithstanding, Priceline or any company's interest in shifting the marketing mix.","So as we look to the future of our Hotel business, we see strengthening relationships with these folks, with our supplier direct channel, with the independent hotels, leaving us in a position of a nice healthy option.","Operator","And our next question is from Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Mike Olson","The non-Hotel business has been really strong. What's the biggest factor there? Is it strong inventory growth? Is it more effective marketing? Is it something else? And then are you seeing any real competition in that space, or is the competition primarily offline bookings in tourist Attractions and Restaurants?","And then secondly, if you could mention what you're expecting for tax rate to look like in 2018 based on the recent changes? Thank you.","Ernst Teunissen","Yes, our non-Hotel business, particularly Attractions, is doing really well. It's all a function of having a wonderful supply footprint that continues to grow, matching it - getting better and better at matching it with the demand footprint that TripAdvisor prides plus all the indirect channels that the Viator business unit also chases, be it the travel agents or the viator.com set of websites or other third-party relationships.","So not unlike how the hotel space has had some fantastic growth over the past couple of decades in the form of booking engines Viator and its supply team had been impasse to getting Attractions bookable online. And when we acquired them, integrated our demand platform into that, it just fueled the growth that you're seeing and that we expect to see for many more years.","We don't look at \u2013 or we haven't identified meaningful competitors in the space that are directly competitive to Viator. It's not to say there aren't handfuls in various countries but really, the point of competition or the point of growth opportunity is teaching folks that when they're on TripAdvisor, they can book those attractions.","When they're on Viator and all the other vehicles that consumers will use to book, that it's, in many cases, smarter, cheaper, safer to book in advance or book on our mobile device when you're in market rather than walk up to the attraction and hope you can get a ticket or phone it in or rely on a hotel concierge.","So we're tapping into a marketplace that is exploding in terms of going from the traditional offline mechanisms to online, and we think we're in a great position to capture the increased demand. ","Steve Kaufer","In terms of the tax rate and the impact from the recent changes, there are many puts and takes but the most important impact on us in the upcoming year and in the following years is the lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. We have a little over half of our revenues in the U.S. and a very sizable component of our profits in the U.S., and so that's going to make an impact.","Our GAAP tax rate, we expect to be in the high 30s. Despite of that, in 2018, we have a couple of GAAP impacts that keep it up in 2018. One is SPC impacts from our share price and the second one is certain loss of countries that we - can be used for tax purposes as that allows us. So high 30s is the GAAP tax that we expect. We expect a lower non-GAAP tax.","Operator","And our next question is from Deepak Mathivanan from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Deepak Mathivanan","Two questions for me. So first, excluding TV spend, direct marketing costs per hotel shopper was down almost 20% this quarter, and you noted improved marketing ROIs from online channels as well. Can you elaborate on how you're achieving this? Is it any specific channel? And also do you expect this to continue in 2018?","And then the second question is on mobile monetization. In terms of smartphone revenue per shopper, it was strong once again this year. What inning overall on a high level do you think we're currently in the stack? Do you see opportunities for mobile and desktop to converge at some point in the next few years? Thanks, guys.","Ernst Teunissen","To start with online marketing, yes, it's a very important driver of what's going on in our auction business in particular in Q4 and into 2018. So what \u2013 we have progressively refined over the past year our ability and attribution of the downstream convertibility of traffic.","We've always managed online marketing as a basket to roughly breakeven. But as we have better information on attribution and better models, we're basically seeing that some of the spend was not profitable, and so we've become more sophisticated in identifying that and have started in the back half of 2017 to eliminate some of that spend and we'll continue to do that into 2018.","Now the impact of that is that it reduces our growth rate from online channels and this is across search and other online channels. It reduces our spend. It reduces our revenue but it improves our profitability because, by definition, we're taking out the least performing spend here.","And so that's what's been going on in the second half of 2017. And as we look at 2018 and one of the drivers of our statements that we are able to, at least, mitigate the impacts on EBITDA and decrease the decline in EBITDA, 2017 to 2018 versus 2016 to 2017, is that we pull back on some of that marketing spend to help the bottom line.","Steve Kaufer","With respect to the mobile monetization question, it's definitely still early innings. We have some nice tailwinds, we believe, from consumers who are getting more and more comfortable booking something as complex as travel on their phone, and that just naturally helps our downstream conversion rate.","We're getting better - the industry, I should say, is getting better at measuring cross device attribution. So someone who looks on our site and clicks downstream and then returns later on a desktop to book on a client side, we are getting - we expect to get more credit for that; and some of our newer products like sponsored listings that help hoteliers get into the consideration set for where someone might want to stay, or for restaurants are priced the same and work equally well on mobile versus desktop. So kind of at launch, the product is already monetizing at the same rate, if you will.","So, yes, we're proud of the improved revenue per shopper on the phone. We would expect that to continue. Some opinions around the table would say that the highly considered weeklong vacation purchase, while maybe researched on the phone, is still going to be transacted for a while on desktop.","I'm thinking that's happening a lot quicker than some others, but just internally, we know that all of our development, all of our focus is delivering the best product on the phone, with the responsive design that also carries it to the web, but we're planning for the phone ads. We're building for the phone as our future now.","Operator","And our next question is from Justin Patterson from Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Justin Patterson","Two if I can. First, you called out preserving Hotels segment profit and making trade-offs against the growth in the prepared remarks. Could you talk about how you came to that decision? I think we're all used to your philosophy of investing for the long term. So I\u2019m curious if there's any shift there.","And then secondly, with non-Hotel, you called out a few growth opportunities in the year ahead from improving the user experience, enhancing transaction capabilities and growing media advertising opportunities. Could you really just flush that out in more detail, where are you at on those initiatives today and how should we think about that investment going forward? Thanks.","Ernst Teunissen","I'll take the first part of the question. We're investing significantly and we have been investing in 2017 in this long-term growth for the Hotel segment and we believe that there is ample opportunity for us to return to profitable growth in the Hotel segment.","And the big investments we have been making and continue to make are booked on the product side. We have been investing in a much improved user experience as it comes to price comparison for hotels. And then, additionally, have reinforced that with a strong brand marketing campaign.","And so last year, we spent $74 million on TV. We're going to spend more in 2018 and those are long-term investments in changing user perception from predominantly seeing us as a great place to do research, to a great place to do research and price compare and find the best deal on the hotel side. And so that's a long-term investment that we're making and continue to make and believe will ultimately get us back to profitable growth on the hotel side.","In the near term, we look at our bottom line on the hotel - in the Hotel segment in particular, in 2016 and 2017, we've seen a meaningful reduction of our EBITDA. And when looking at some of the levers that we have there, we've turned our eye to online marketing. I've talked before how we\u2019ve looked at online marketing and the potential there to create some benefit.","That doesn't come at a long-term cost to us or not at a significant long-term cost to us strategically, because a lot of that revenue that we create with this online marketing is short-term in nature. It doesn't have a very large lifetime value component to it. And so it's a short-term revenue gain that actually has a short-term negative EBITDA impact as well.","And so as we mitigate the EBITDA losses in our Hotel business, that's the area of investment that we focus on the most while continuing to be able - to have room for investment in the things that really, matter for us to do long-term.","And so between those and we strike a balance between getting to sustainable growth in the Hotel business over time and making sure we invest in that while preserving EBITDA and margin in the Hotel business by focusing on some of the more near-term impacts of online marketing.","Steve Kaufer","So sort of moving on from that, kind of focus on the hotels, I bring in how kind of the new organization and the new President roles that we've created really help drive home. The President hotel is chartered \u2013 and that hotel business unit is chartered with delivering the absolute best hotel shopping experience, making sure the marketing mix is appropriate, as Ernst talked about, leaning into the TV campaign for the brand shift, for the consumer awareness as a more sustainable long-term EBITDA positive growth trajectory for hotels.","And then it set up a business unit on our core experience because when we look at the non-hotels, it's really leveraging this incredible demand, the incredible footprint that this TripAdvisor community of travelers that, I have to admit, has been underinvested in relative to our particular shopping channels in the past.","And so I wanted to deliver or we want to deliver a real crisp look at that core experience in terms of a consistent interface across the platform, new vehicles to attract customers to TripAdvisor, a stickier part of the journey so that you're building - you're not just shopping for a hotel or just shopping for an attraction but planning out your entire trip on TripAdvisor because that is a piece of our differentiated experience that really nobody else can touch.","And so when we look at that, it's yet another way to build an experience that is unique to TripAdvisor that monetizes across several different channels, be it flights, hotels or rentals or Restaurants or Attractions leans perhaps a little bit more to media when you look across the segments, and that's - you have a launch of two of our newest media product in the past six months.","One's a replacement for restaurants and a similar product for hotels, and that again all complements having the best-in-class shopping experience for each of the verticals. And so attraction is certainly growing super fast with, as I mentioned before, lots of headroom. So time that in to our demand footprint is where we see high growth for TripAdvisor in the future on a very differentiated playing field.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark May from Citi. Your line is now open.","Mark May","A couple here. Given that some of your Attractions revenue comes from TripAdvisor traffic, I guess the question is why is the pullback in online marketing spend, which I realize is mostly tied to kind of your hotel marketing not impacting growth there? Does it imply that the businesses are relatively separate and distinct and there's not a lot of kind of cross sell or tie between the two?","And then given this renewed effort to reduce spend in some of the unproductive performance channels, I'm trying to get a sense of how quickly this will happen. I guess one way of asking it, at what point this year or next year do you kind of get to a point where you're actually growing your spend again, how quickly will this process take place?","Steve Kaufer","I'll take the first one then Ernst the second. So we do run the kind of traffic acquisition teams for Attractions and Hotels separately. So when we talk about, as Ernst - to elaborate on the change in the marketing mix, it's really all about hotels.","So Attraction continues to secure traffic through all available channels, both buying traffic onto the TripAdvisor point of sale as well as the various TripAdvisor domestic and international points of sale as well as the various domestic and international Viator points of sale. So full steam ahead there, no pullback at all on the Attractions side.","Ernst Teunissen","And with regards to your second part of your question, Mark, we have started to pull back on the marketing in Q3 and in Q4 and are continuing to do that in Q1 and then throughout the rest of the year, and the impact will be year-over-year will be felt in every quarter but of course is going to be felt more in the front half of the year because we started to pull back already in Q3 and Q4 of 2017. And we see this as a reset that will continue throughout 2018, setting us up well for 2019 thereafter.","Operator","Our next question is from Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually Seth on for Lloyd, and just two if I can. You noted stabilizing bid auctions in metasearch. So I'm just wondering if you're seeing auctions migrate out relative to the 3Q bid downs or if it's just more stability there and not continued declines. And if you feel like the auctions have enough density that there's decent visibility there at this point. Or is there still a lot of movement there and making it difficult to assess?","And then also, just like as a follow-up on a previous question, I was just wondering how much of a direct sales and marketing spend was unprofitable? Thank you.","Steve Kaufer","I'll take the first one, Ernst the second. We have seen stability in auction. We remind folks it's always volatile month-to-month and it's rare that we've kind of called anything out other than that one-time Q3 bid-downs that we saw that clearly had a material effect. So with the caveat of \u2013 yes, there's always a some ups and downs, I would say, the term is stabilized, not shifting any particular direction since Q3.","Ernst Teunissen","And on the direct spend, it's a minority that we've identified as unprofitable but it's a sizable enough minority for it to matter and really be \u2013 a real lever that we have for EBITDA mitigation. And so we have identified that and we'll continue to evaluate as we go forward.","It's a dynamic in the sense that, to the extent that we are able to improve our monetization revenue per shopper, that also helps the return, obviously, of the paid spend and, therefore, has some of the spend that we have identified currently as unprofitable become profitable. But right now, we have identified a , as we saw a meaningful minority of spend that we're able to address.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin Kopelman from Cowen & Co. Your line is now open.","Kevin Kopelman","So one, to start off over on the Hotel revenue side. I think you just kind of discussed some of the Q4 trends. Could you give us any more color on 2018 on the Hotel revenue side? What's the magnitude of the declines that you expect there? Are you looking low single digits, high single digits, double digits? Any additional color you could give there.","Ernst Teunissen","We have not quantified. We've stated that we expect a decline. We've not quantified the magnitude of the expected decline. We are pulling back on marketing, as I described before, and we are investing in television. We believe that the visibility that we have on EBITDA is a little better than on revenue, especially because of that dynamic that I was describing of.","The actual monetization that we'll find has a leverage effect on how much we can spend on marketing. And so the variability on our revenue line is a little bit larger than on the EBITDA line.","So we've chosen to give better visibility on overall EBITDA, and said we would be approximately flat for the year on consolidated EBITDA. And on the revenue expect to be down, but haven't quantified that. As we progress in the year, we may or may not clarify that view.","Kevin Kopelman","And so may be switching over to Attractions then. It's gotten to be pretty sizable at this point. Can you give us any sense of what the average take rate is there? Obviously, we know there can be big variation within that, but just how to think about the overall business.","Ernst Teunissen","Yes. Average take rates are healthy. There is variability in them, but they can be as good or sometimes better than the Hotel business. So it's a very \u2013 from a profitability perspective, from both the gross margin as well as a contribution margin perspective, very healthy business.","And the growth is continuing very nicely in our Attractions business. We saw a sort of a quarter-on-quarter deceleration of revenue growth in non-Hotel in Q4. That was not driven by attraction. Attractions was - has continued to grow continually before very consistently.","We had a few more one-off impacts on our Restaurant business and our rentals business that we don't expect to continue into 2018. And for the whole non-Hotel segment, of which Attractions is about half now, we expect very similar growth as we've seen in 2016 and 2017. In 2016, we saw 27% growth. In 2017, we saw 24% growth in that non-Hotel segment and we expect continued performance there with Attractions clearly a strong performer in that portfolio.","Kevin Kopelman","And then you talked about in the letter about TripAdvisor point-of-sale growth. Should we still \u2013 should we think of that business as being like half TripAdvisor point of sale, half Viator, or what's the breakout? ","Steve Kaufer","We haven't done that breakout but I do encourage you to remember that, Kevin, there is the Viator point-of-sale and all of the international components. There\u2019s all of the third-party distribution agreements that Viator had before we bought them and they've expanded since. There's the travel agent channel that again sell-through Viator and TripAdvisor is a channel.","So TripAdvisor is clearly growing the fastest because we're able to tap into this existing demand and kind of control both sides of it but I wouldn't want to think at this point that most of the demand or anything is coming from TripAdvisor. That would not be accurate.","Ernst Teunissen","But it is growing - so it is growing the fastest and we see definitely as we look at the future of the Attraction segment, we think the biggest potential is to continue to leverage the large user base we have on the TripAdvisor pages. And so a big focus, to keep improving that product and make sure we have more products on TripAdvisor so we can improve that monetization of those users.","Kevin Kopelman","And then one last question. How are you thinking about overhead costs? In 2017, they were pretty flat. They were maybe up just a little bit. What are you planning for 2018? Thanks.","Ernst Teunissen","On the Hotel side, in particular, as you can imagine, we're very careful with any expense item not just marketing but any overhead or any people investment that we make, and we continued to do that. Clearly, we are matching our ability to grow expenses with our ability to grow revenue. On the non-Hotel side, we continue to invest and we'll see growth on the non-Hotel side.","Operator","And our next question is from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open.","Eric Sheridan","Maybe two if I can. One, bigger picture, which I think sort of what everyone is trying to get out on the call is, Steve, maybe thinking out over the next couple of years with the industry growing in roughly to mid-teens and marketing growing roughly in line with that, what are some of the things that are sort of in your control in terms of deploying assets to get the Hotel business back to that kind of growth versus the structural headwinds you're seeing, whether it'd be product innovation from competitors or diversification of their own advertising spend that we should sort of factor in as headwinds to getting back to that kind of growth? It's a more of a medium- and long-term question there.","And then on the brand advertising, with the move from about 74 million in 2017 to a range of 100 million to 130 million in 2018, how much of that increase is leaning in on geographies where you're already spending TV versus broadening out TV on the marketing side more globally? Thanks guys.","Steve Kaufer","I'll take the first. Big picture, we see tremendous growth available to us in the hotel space. We haven't been able to deliver anywhere near the expectations that we hold ourselves accountable for in the past couple of years. We know that and we've been doing a bunch of things over the past year to address it, to improve our fundamentals, to improve the structure and the way that we're running the company internally.","And of course, it starts with delivering a better product on all fronts. So we've made nice strides on the fundamentals like pricing, like usability, measuring - doing a better job measuring preference, site performance.","These are all things that may not get a lot of fanfare but are very meaningful for improving conversion on the site which is - its revenue is direct revenue and improving user engagement. So we think that there's still a lot that we can do there and we have a track record of making those improvements.","I then point you to some of the newer products, media products like TripAdvisor ads, enabling hoteliers to get into the consideration set. It's almost all incremental revenue and profit for us. So there's potential there that we're excited about, and the cadence of us releasing these new products I think is a good sign internally when we look into the company.","And again, it's both helping the consumer and helping the biz. And then when we look at our shift of marketing mix, we have many, many years of doing the search engine marketing pieces, and we kind of know what to expect by way of how it changes the brand and how it builds or doesn't build a lifetime value, whereas TV, the signs that we're seeing are quite encouraging for that longer-term brand-building, changing the perception of TripAdvisor from just reviews to a place where I cannot only read reviews, discover, but also shop. And that shop action, finding the best price, obviously, is where the money is in hotels.","Take all of that together and you can easily see the hotel \u2013 we see that Hotel business getting back into meaningful growth mode over the next few years and that, again, delivers on the bottom line as well, completely separate and very different dynamics of the non-Hotel space but we've already talked about that.","Ernst Teunissen","And in terms of things that are out of control, which is the other part of your question, Eric, is clearly what has lessened our control is the marketing strategy of our partners as well as our competitors choose to behave.","And we believe that we have such a potential with the platform, as Steve was just describing, of making improvements that we can get back to growth over the - sustainable growth in that Hotel business over time and effectively offset any of the pressures that we can see there.","But Eric, especially in the short term, as we saw in Q3, there are bumps in the road that we cannot \u2013 that are out of our control very clearly. The best thing we can do and what is in our control to continue to make sure that we have very high converting traffic on our sites and we believe that ultimately will pay off in revenue for us because that's valuable traffic where a large site, valuable traffic for any partner.","And we continue to hone our product and make it better and better and so we can stay ahead of the competition or catch up in areas where we have to catch up which was true on the price comparison side in 2017.","The next part of your question, Eric, was around TV. We are going to invest in new markets as well, so this is the combination of continuing investment in existing markets. Last year, in those existing markets, we obviously only spend for a little over half a year. We started in June, but we have learned a lot and we think we can more efficiently spend some of that TV spend in those existing markets as well, and so we'll continue to do that.","We're launching some new markets as well and expand the number of \u2013 really the footprint that we touch in terms of our overall revenue footprint. We're also launching a new creative in parallel to our existing creative that we have put in place. And we believe that being able to compare those two will help us drive forward as well.","We acknowledge that the consensus was higher of how much we're going to spend. We've looked carefully about what we thought was a good progression. We see good signs in our television investment. We see positive signs in terms of the branded metrics that we see both in terms of appreciation and brand awareness as well as just spiking branded traffic on our sites in those markets where we're on TV, but we're going to grow this gradually rather than in big lumps.","And so this $100 million to $130 million is a gradual progression from the $74 million that we spent in 2018. And of course, we'll continue to evaluate that on our way to getting this to breakeven for us.","Operator","Our next question is from Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Jed Kelly","How the directing marketing related to the non-Hotel segment grow in 2017, how should we think about non-Hotel advertising growing in 2018 in relation to its revenue? And then secondly, can you just give us an update on how you are thinking of investing in Vacation Rental segment going forward?","Ernst Teunissen","Yes, Jed. I'll take the first question and then I'll ask Steve to answer the second one. So the non-Hotel business, we have online marketing spend in \u2013 particularly in our Attractions and Rentals business, to a lesser extent also on our Restaurant business.","We ran a small TV campaign on the restaurant business last year, and we continue to invest in marketing in the non-Hotel segment, particularly on the Attractions side to make sure that we can continue to capture the growth there.","Steve Kaufer","And on the Vacation Rentals side, we look at rentals as an important category for all of our travelers. We've had it on the site for quite a few years in almost all of our markets and we certainly expect that to grow in prominence as we feature it to more travelers and more places on the site.","So one of the things that we look and say we don't do a good enough job at is presenting rentals in markets where we don't have the right set of hotels or predominantly rental markets, and right now it's, we admit, too difficult to find on our site.","So, short version of the answer is rentals strategic part of the offering for TripAdvisor, for the accommodation shopper, and that will stay that way, but we're not making massive new investments in the rental category, vis-\u00e0-vis the other players out there. ","Operator","Our next question is from Naved Khan from SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Naved Khan","I have two questions. One on the Hotel side and one on the non-Hotel. On the Hotel side, can you just comment on performance of the bookings, direct bookings by hotels, how that is doing relative to meta? And then on the non-Hotel side, does it make sense in the Attractions business to maybe do some distribution, maybe potentially accelerating growth in this business?","Ernst Teunissen","On the hotel side, instant booking or the ability to actually finish the transaction on TripAdvisor remains part of the product on all platforms in most countries. We think of it as burning its spot in the meta auction. So where we have signals that the consumer prefers this, then that's what we will show in the premier position. Otherwise, it is yet another option.","It's not a strategic thrust for us to grow that channel as it happens because a segment of a population like it, that's wonderful for us. If not, that's okay. So we're no longer, as of a while ago, we're not trying to push that forward and we're not investing a ton of resources in that particular path versus a click-off to a supplier or an OTA.","To the second question, Attraction distribution, we are thrilled to sign up as many distribution partners for our Attractions business globally. We think of it as TripAdvisor is one, albeit very large, distribution channel for the Viator supply platform, but it's only one and they have many others and we love there to be hundreds more.","So we have separated the concept. We're not preferencing a TripAdvisor platform. We love as many different channels to be picking up that our supply to be as valuable to Attraction owners as we can. And so since we have the demand and demand is growing, it's obviously great for the TripAdvisor traveler but it's equally great for travelers who are on other sites.","Operator","Our next question is from Perry Gold from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.","Perry Gold","Anything you'd call out in terms of macro trends, strengths or weaknesses in any particular markets? Thanks so much.","Steve Kaufer","Nothing that we call out in particular other than comment I think you heard from others in the industry, but we believe overall the market is robust and we are working through our transition but we believe we're operating in a robust online travel environment.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Bieber from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Paul Bieber","I have two. I think you may have responded to sort of one question, in Eric's question. But I was under the impression that you plan to spend 150 million on TV ad spend in 2018. What changed? And perhaps if you could give a little bit more color on just the early results that you're seeing in some - early results you're seeing from some of the TV ad campaign. And then the second question I have is what drove the acceleration in display advertising revenue?","Steve Kaufer","First, on the TV. So we didn't guide to a number for 2018 before. We said we would gradually increase is what we said about it. And as I was saying before is as we look at different campaigns, the impact, we see good results. We see what we want to see. We also believe that we could improve still. I said before, we're launching a new creative in parallel.","We have had lot of learnings about improvement opportunities that we have in different markets that we've invested in last year. And so rather than really expanding much more aggressively in the area of $200 million in 2018, we're going to do this gradually. And so we're going to earn our way into it. And if it continues to do well, that means we can increase our plans for 2019.","On the display side, so we saw \u2013 as you probably point to some of the acceleration in that line of our display and subscription in Q4, the display business can sometimes be lumpy with budgets at the end of the year being allocated at the last minute and doesn't always replicate. So we saw some of that happening in our Q4 business. And so I caution against extrapolating the Q4 growth rate into 2018.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Rob on the call for Peter. Thanks for taking our questions. On the strong mobile revenue per shopper growth, is it fair to assume that would have grown even more strongly excluding some of the challenges in the auction? Or was mobile not as impacted by some of the challenges there? Just wondering if you could comment on some of the underlying trends?","And then also on the reorganization, the core experience. Wondering if there's anything that\u2019s come out of that early on in terms of changes in marketing, messaging or site design that you could point to any outcomes of that reorg so far? Thank you.","Steve Kaufer","I'll go ahead and start in, maybe Ernst could add more. Mobile rev per shopper, we have seen that grow. As I mentioned before, some of it is going to be just the tailwind of people being more comfortable booking but we've done a lot by way of reducing the friction and improving the user experience on the phone.","To the best of my recollection, the bid-downs that we saw in Q3 were across all devices because our clients had wanted to - well, some of our clients had wanted to pull back - well, for their set of issues, I would say. So the short version would be, yes, we think our mobile rev per shopper would be higher had it not been some of the bid-downs.","For the core experience unit, it's very early days in the reorganization but we are focused internally on building that sort of connective tissue, making sure that the user feels like they're on one TripAdvisor site, experiencing multiple different parts of our value proposition.","We're excited about it. We see a better impact on membership. We've also been working hard on some of the foundational layers. We're rolling out some new \u2013 some of our new map functionality has just been kind of rolling out which, if you're experiencing it, you're on the test slice, and I think you'd agree that it's actually much better than it has been, and that's going to play out over the course of the year as we delight users in more aspects of the overall shopping experience.","I do see with - there're some new features coming over the course of the year that aren't particular to the hotel shopping versus the attraction shopping versus the flight shopping, but are really more focused around enabling folks to plan and have a better trip and enjoy the travel experience and those will be rolling out in plan, in design, in dev now and rolling out over the course of the year as kind of output coming from this particular business unit.","Ernst Teunissen","It's another highlight is, just to follow up on Eric's earlier question about what is in your control and what's not in your control. Clearly, what we are doing is investing in revenue sources outside of the core auction where more of those elements outside of our control are present as we all know. And so this core access is one example of that. Non-Hotel investment is another example of that.","And Steve was talking about some of these new ad products that we offer to hotels as well. And so these are all categories of where we believe real potential diversification away from reliance on the core auction uncontrollable dynamics.","Operator","Our next question is from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Heath Terry","I was hoping you could unpack the math behind the online marketing spend reduction for us a little bit. Did these channels become unproductive because of better information to TripAdvisor around attribution? Is it because the cost of inventory went up, conversion rates declined or because monetization behind those convergence declined?","And then, also as you work on your direct booking relationships, how are you seeing hotels use loyalty rates or other pricing strategies to drive direct traffic through the channel?","Ernst Teunissen","Good question on the unpacking of what's going on, on the online site. And I think it's a bit of all of those things, but a couple of things to say about that. First is our approach had been to spend to approximately breakeven on average across the portfolio, and we have different \u2013 as in any portfolio, of course, different levels of profitability and some more profitable and some less profitable as a starting point. So we have taken a more disciplined look at that.","The second thing that has happened is we have improved our attribution models, and so we have been able to have better insight into the downstream conversion of some of the traffic that we provide. Of course, we have \u2013 we operate a model in which we get paid on a per-click basis but then the downstream conversion of that traffic is actually very important for future behavior in the auction.","We've become smarter about that attribution across devices, attribution across channels. And so that has given us some new insight into what we believe are more or less profitable channels. And then there's indeed the impact of as your revenue per shopper moves some channels that were profitable before become less profitable. And so all of those have allowed us to take a harder look at \u2013 and drawing a different line of the performance we want to achieve across all channels.","Steve Kaufer","On the kind of loyalty rates and other things that other partners currently do that we don't. We think it's, in the scheme of things, a relatively small effect, if any. There's always been a certain preference among some to book supplier direct, and we have those suppliers, almost all of them, in our auction today.","So if you are a loyal Marriott user, that's wonderful. You come to TripAdvisor, make sure you're getting a good price, click on the Marriott link and book and get your points and\/or your better pricing, your loyalty rates.","We also have the subscription product that takes advantage of that instant book direct, and again, we get paid a little differently but we still get paid for when a traveler has that brand direct preference.","So it's not really in our wheelhouse to opine on whether those programs are gaining traction or not but we don't think it's going to have a material impact on our business even if they did.","Operator","Our next question is from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Douglas Anmuth","First, I just want to circle back on mobile. Can you just talk about the current monetization gap with desktop and with mobile at 45% of hotel shoppers? How do you think about the timing of mobile moving from a growth headwind to a tailwind?","And then secondly, with the buyback in place, can you just comment on how you're thinking about capital allocation going forward? Thanks.","Ernst Teunissen","On the monetization, so we keep that improving that monetization gap as again this quarter, we accelerated RPS on the phone, and we see definitely more upside there and more opportunity to narrow. How far we can really narrow it over time is a question and Steve addressed it before of what is going to be ultimately the behavior of our users for the higher end of travel booking.","And, therefore, it's always going to skew more to desktop, but we believe we could continue on this path of narrowing it. It may never completely close but around on the path to narrow it.","In terms of capital allocation, we have a sufficient funding capacity. We have both cash, and since tax reform, that cash is more freely usable across the globe for us than before and we have a sizable credit facility in place. So we have the funds. We look at two ways of capital allocation beyond investment in operations.","One is M&A. We continue to keep an active radar on M&A. We've been less active on the M&A front in 2017 compared to previous years, but we continue to look at great opportunities to help us grow and enhance our strategy.","And then buyback has been a consistent area of investment. We invested $250 million in 2017 and in - we've just received another approval for 250 from our Board, and so we're actively continuing to look at that as one of the options we have for capital allocation.","Operator","Our next question is from James Lee from Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open.","James Lee","Ernst, maybe one more follow-up question on marketing spending. Can you talk about maybe reduction, is it geography related, where in certain geography you found in efficiency, and therefore you decide to reduce the spending? And also looking at 2018 declining kind of marketing spend on performance, also any geographic implications there? Thanks.","Steve Kaufer","Hi James. We can barely make out your question. So Gigi, could we go to the next caller, please?","Operator","Our next question is from Nat Schindler from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Nat Schindler","A couple of questions. One, how does GDPR affect your cookie-based marketing in attribution in Europe? Secondly, can you unpack the logic on the buyback of 250 million? Your cash position, your net cash position continues to fall, mostly for your buyback last year obviously, but also your free cash flow growth is considerably less. And yet your multiple's probably one of the highest point than it's ever been. So what is the logic on using that cash there versus investing somewhere else?","Operator","And our next question is from Laura Martin from Needham. Your line is now open.","Laura Martin","Can you guys hear me okay? Hello. Can you guys hear me?","Steve Kaufer","We can hear you but we cannot hear any specifics of what anybody is saying at this point.","Laura Martin","So, you can't hear my question but you can just hear that I'm asking something right now?","Steve Kaufer","Gigi, I think we have to end the call at this point because we can't make out anything that anybody is saying.","Operator","At this time, I am showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Steve Kaufer, CEO for closing remarks.","Steve Kaufer","Well, I want to thank everyone. I thank all TripAdvisor employees around the globe. Sorry that we're having some technical difficulty at the end of the call here. With all of you on the line, I wish we could take a couple of more questions, but in any event, we look forward to talking to you and catching up with you next quarter.

Please go ahead.","Will Lyons","Thanks, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our call. Joining me today are our CEO, Steve Kaufer, and our CFO, Ernst Teunissen.","Last night after market close, we distributed and filed our second quarter 2019 earnings release and we made available our prepared remarks on our Investor Relations website located at ir.tripadvisor.com.

Please refer to our earnings release as well as our filings with the SEC for information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.","Now, here is Steve, who\u2019ll share a few thoughts before we open the call up to your questions.","Steve Kaufer","Thank you, Will, and good morning, everyone. To summarize, our prepared remarks from last night in the second quarter and first half of 2019, we drove strong consolidated profit growth grew Hotels, Media & Platform segment profit and expanded profit margins and delivered rapid Experiences & Dining segment growth in bookings, supply and revenue.","First half results keep us on track to deliver double-digit consolidated adjusted EBITDA growth this year, and we're pleased with our 2019 progress towards our revenue growth objectives.","TripAdvisor remains the world's largest travel community. We have a powerful global offering built on people-powered information in a trusted brand. We help consumers discover explore and experience the world in unique and compelling ways. This year, we are operating with enhanced customer focus and we are executing well on a number of initiatives to deepen our customer engagement, grow and serve our members, and deliver travelers a more holistic and seamless travel experience. We're also laying the foundation for a world-class media business to enable partners to capture more value on our platform, which can enable us to further monetize our significant travel influence.","We'll now open-up the call for questions.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Barclays. Your line is open.","Deepak Mathivanan","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So, first, can you talk about the media \u2013 the strategy behind the media efforts at a little bit more in detail? The content particularly on the feed is improving steadily and we look at that very closely. And we also noticed that, you're launching some new ad units recently. Although it's still in early days, what should we expect to see both in terms of product and also in terms of monetization efforts over the next few quarters that makes this a more sizable business in the next few say \u2013 next few years?","Steve Kaufer","Sure. Thanks for the question. This is Steve. We first kind of want to remember more than 400 million unique users, and they're almost all on our site looking for place to go, looking for a place to stay, looking for a thing to do, a place to eat. That's an incredible amount of influence across the travel ecosystem. And as you know, we've monetized through a couple of different vehicles so far in our history, but we really don't feel we've tapped into the opportunity to better understand who these folks are so that we can segment them and offer visibility to these users across all of our endemic clients as well as non-endemic clients.","So you've noticed a couple of different ad units. That's great. You'll see more custom pieces throughout the site. You'll see more native integrated pieces. The feed will be part of that, but I wouldn't say it would be -- I wouldn't guess as we implement new products I wouldn't guess that it would be the majority of the new pieces.","We're going where we find consumers are at a decision point. Where can we inspire them or where can we help our clients inspire them to go to that location? And then how can we help select the right hotel the right thing to do for them? All that comes down to new video units, better programmatic capabilities or our clients can buy easier on our platform, more ad units across all of our devices and in general a better targeting ad text stack that we're already in the process of assembling.","So this is new people, relatively new effort. I should say we have a very nice display and media business but it's a nice opportunity for us to dramatically grow that using latest technology where we haven't invested as much before. Compared to some of our peers with our audience size, we see it relatively \u2013 we see what we believe to be a fantastic opportunity for doubling this part of our business in the next three to five years.","Deepak Mathivanan","Great. Thanks, Steve. And then Ernst was the 2Q revenue trends in the HM&P segment a surprise to you at all? How are you thinking about it? And then looking at it in terms of back half as well, so you're calling out returning to growth in 4Q. Is that primarily from comping through some of the marketing expenses, or is there any other puts and takes that\u2019s going on in there as well? Thank you.","Ernst Teunissen","Hey Deepak. The profit growth trend in HM&P was not a surprise to us. We continue to benefit from the optimizations that we've done around our marketing expenses. We saw continued aggressive profit improvement. First half now, we have a total of 31% EBITDA growth in our HM&P segment and Q2 was very close to the 30% mark. So that was very pleasing and very strong for us.","On the revenue side, we had said that we would continue to see some weakness in the overall revenue line as a result of the marketing pullback. This quarter we additionally saw some increased SEO trends as well that we focused on. But if you look ahead for the rest of the year, in Q4 we are seeing the segment go back to growth. Into Q1 for next year, we have fully lapped all the marketing -- the reset that we have done. We will be in a position to start growing our eight marketing channels again and we're forecasting to return to growth on the HM&P segment in that year.","Display is an additional growth driver for the back half. So, it's not just comping the paid marketing spend. The display initiatives that Steve was just talking about will start to kick-in some extra contribution to our revenue growth as well towards the end of the year for our expectation.","Deepak Mathivanan","Okay. Thanks Ernst.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Lloyd Walmsley","Thanks, guys. Two questions, if I can. First, can you just talk about the comments in the letter on E&D segment growth tapering? And what might be driving that? And where are you in terms of bookings through core TripAdvisor versus Viator? Is some of the impact competitive or are you kind of done making TripAdvisor kind of fully bookable?","And then second one just when you talk about slower demand is that on the consumer side in terms of hotel shoppers or the advertiser side or both? Any comment you can share on trends in pricing options will be great.","Ernst Teunissen","Yes. Hi Lloyd, thank you. First of all growth for the segment E&D in the second quarter was strong. It was 28%, but excluding the impact of currency was 33%. The product supply and marketing initiatives that we're driving are progressing very nicely, pleased with that. We're making a lot of investments this year that may not necessarily impact the revenue growth this year, but is setting us up for longer term growth on the platform. And as you know a huge market opportunity across both restaurant and experiences that is very untapped, 80% offline on the Experiences side.","There's a couple of things this year in the revenue trends that we called out before is one is currency. Obviously, it's making an impact this half, but also in the next half. We've called out before that -- we're comping some very high growth in our -- with new restaurant products and restaurant media products that we built last year and we're comping against that particularly in the back half of the year that was a major factor last year.","But also we have pretty explosive growth on the TA platform for Experiences last year which we're comping into as well. So, if you dial back from all of that we -- we're making huge investments for the growth here -- for the future here and there's long-term sustainable growth that we're able to capture we believe. We're playing to win. Not everything is focused on optimizing revenue this year, but we see this as a long-term growth opportunity for TripAdvisor.","Steve Kaufer","And then, this is Steve. When you look at the actual what's going on, on TripAdvisor there is -- we think we're doing a much better job helping our travelers find the things that they really want to book in advance before they go.","We feel there's a lot more headroom there. We're improving our -- what we call our trip functionality, so you can start building more of a trip together. That needs to include and will include abilities to book tours, those magical moments that are part of the vacation that trip has. Whether they be thinks sold on the platform or just the wonderful advice that you can get, it's really that full package that consider Trip that allows us to shine so well and Experiences is a vital part of that.","Ernst Teunissen","To your second question Lloyd about the hotel meta option, the trends that we're seeing are on the consumer side. So, on the supplier side, we've seen consistency in the bidding behavior of our partners. We've seen slower demand in paid marketing obviously because we're bidding less aggressively on those search terms, and we're getting fewer paid customers in. And on the SEO side, we made the comments that we saw some slowdown.","Lloyd Walmsley","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of line of Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Mike Olson","Good morning. Other than the space continue to talk more, more about getting more aggressive in the activities and Experiences segment, just wondering if you're seeing any evidence and more competition in that category, or not really at this point? And then, also in Experiences & Dining I realized you're pushing for long-term growth with continued investment in the segment. I believe you've said in the past that you think the segment can have a margin profile that's more similar to HM&P. Do you still believe that's the case, or is there anything structural that would make that more challenging? Thanks.","Steve Kaufer","Hi, Mike. Thanks for the question. This is Steve. The focus \u2013 the way we look at the overall experiences market is that, it's really in the beginning. The demand is huge. This is a huge new category coming online. We got in really early. We have a number of other players that are also in the space. But the vast, vast majority of everything going on is still offline, offline in the pre-trip phase, offline in the destination as in someone walks up and buy something. We truly believe, all of that or a huge portion of that will migrate online and some of it will migrate online to our app others for pre-purchase or pre-trip activities. We're doing our best to invest in all the different areas we need in order to capture more than our fair share of the marketplace.","We fully expect all of our competitors to be on the same game plan and the beauty is there's plenty of opportunity for there would be multiple winners in this category. We think our phenomenal traffic advantage gives us a great opportunity to do extremely well so between traffic, between supply, between the frictionless booking platform we have now it all works.","To your second question on margin profile for the business, we're not going to be too specific, but we do believe that the margins in this category do end up looking like hotel margins have evolved to. And so we feel it's a very natural opportunity for our marketplace to consolidate the supply. And we already have a huge portion of the demand and that makes for a great business with the ton of network effects.","Mike Olson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Naved Khan from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Naved Khan","Yeah. Thanks a lot. Another couple of questions, maybe on the hotel side, as you talked about the SEO headwinds, is that \u2013 are the SEO headwinds just limited on the hotel side, or is that something you're also seeing on Experiences? Can you just clarify that for us? And then just based on the commentary it just seems like, if I look at the Hotel's sub-segment you're going to comp the advertising cuts in Q1 of 2020. So this is that \u2013 when we should expect that sentiment to kind of stabilize or maybe even start seeing positive? What's the right way to think about that?","Steve Kaufer","Sure. Thanks, Naved. This is Steve. I'll take the first SEO related question and let's start with the context, and of course we gain a lot of the SEO traffic for all of our business units and it's a great way for travelers to discover TripAdvisor and in everything we do.","There is an effect of Google and other search engines moving more and more into the travel space and that's a bit of a hotel headwind we called out. Of course it hits all of our business units, but we continue to look at the overall positive of how this traffic finds us, how we're able to educate them on TripAdvisor. And then at some point if you want we can go into the rest of the initiatives that we're doing to otherwise drive long-term loyal behavior of our customer base.","Ernst Teunissen","To your point -- to your second question Naved, HM&P and growth in the future, yeah, this year 2019 is obviously a profit focused year. We've been talking about the significant profits we've been driving. We have progressively throughout 2018 made improvements in our performance marketing. We're now in Q1 and Q2 flat on our returns there. We're happy on our returns. We're lapping into some benefit but it's a diminishing benefit and it should start helping revenue and our ability to start acquiring paid marketing again and grow that line.","So in Q1 of 2020, we'll have fully lap that and we will be in a position to start focusing on growth in our paid marketing channels again. So we've called out -- in Q4 we are anticipating to go to growth for the segment and into 2020 we're expecting growth from that segment.","Naved Khan","Okay. Just a quick clarification on that. I think on the last earnings call, you spoke about some weakness in auctions for the month of April. It seems like that might have been more advertiser driven. Can you just give us more color on how the quarter evolved and if that persisted, or what are you seeing on your end? It seems like based on the results out of the two large OTAs, their own businesses seems to be seeing room rates at least room rates growth in the double digits. So what are you seeing on year end and have those trends improved since April?","Ernst Teunissen","Yeah, Naved. What we called out is not from our perspective an advertiser driven event. It is more about the demand side, on the one hand us pulling back on marketing and increasing efficiency there, which has been an impact and wasn't impacting Q2, plus the SEO challenges that Steve just talked about. And so we are going to lap through a lot of those changes throughout the rest of the year. And as I just responded, we see us return to growth for the segment by the end of the year.","Naved Khan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of line of Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you. A few questions. One, could you please talk about demand trends? You mentioned in the letter that they were softer than anticipated demand trends. A little bit more comment on that will be great?","Second, on your membership and loyal customer base. So that is very interesting. You shared some metrics around frequency as well as the ability to generate more revenue than an average user. Could you talk about what you're doing in order to get more members, in order to keep them more engaged and some of the initiatives that you have taken and may take for the rest of the year?","And then finally on EBITDA thank you for sharing the -- giving some color on double-digit growth rate as well as acceleration in Q4 over Q3 and then back half growth being less than 15%. But could you talk about how you're thinking on investing in the Experiences segment, how we should think about EBITDA in the back half of that segment as you invest? Thank you.","Steve Kaufer","Sure. This is Steve. Thanks for the question. When we look at membership, we look at the ability to sign somebody up, have them use our app, have them invest a bit in the platform that might already in review. It might be saving a couple of things to a trip that they want to take. We then take that information, customize our CRM and our push notifications to make it highly relevant to what the customer is looking for and then encourage them to return to the site to either finish the booking process they were in the middle of or explore another adjacent activity.","You can imagine when there's someone starting on a flight or a hotel, it's a great opportunity to add a thing to do an attraction, a private tour. There's wonderful upsell opportunities that we'll have going down the road.","Job one for us that we've been working on is making sure the messages that we're sending to people are highly relevant. We want to make sure that when they come to the site, we know more about them than just their name and IP address, so that we can give rate recommendations.","That all drives a wonderful value proposition for members and you combine that with our activity of soliciting membership more and you can -- what we're happy to share is we've seen the past four quarters have been consecutive growth in our membership numbers, the growth -- the year-on-year growth of how many new members we add each quarter and we're on -- for the rest of the year.","That's just one indication of how we get from the 400 million a monthly use to a more meaningful set of members who are coming back using us or letting us help them in all of their trips. That's also one aspect of how the demand question gets framed a year from now because we'll have a much more direct relationship with so many more members going forward.","Ernst Teunissen","To your second question about the Experiences & Dining EBITDA trends, this is obviously a year in which we're making investments for the future. This is a year in which EBITDA in this segment is coming down year-over-year fortunately funded by significant EBITDA improvements on the hotel side.","We said before and we maintain that although EBITDA will be lower for the segment, we forecast to be positive for the year in the segment. And so you're going into the second quarter expect additional -- to see additional investment in this segment.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you, Steve and Ernst. And then on demand trends that will be great and that's it for me. Thanks.","Steve Kaufer","Look we already covered some of the demand trends. And then I talked about how membership -- I didn't talk much about app download, but that will be another aspect that we're working on. We have seen some nice results in order to move this demand to be more in our control.","If you're referring to, kind of, overall travel demand in the industry, it's -- we see a number of different kind of signals out there, when we look \u2013 when we listen to other companies' comments. There's a little confusion out there but we're seeing a reasonably good travel environment at the moment.","So in our prepared remarks, we're not commenting or we're not calling out anything particularly unique in travel that's causing a big plus or a big minus for us. So we're happy with the overall environment and we're executing and putting we think well on our journey. ","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Justin Patterson from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Justin Patterson","Great. Thank you. I wanted to go back to the ad platform opportunity. How should we think through the investment ramp and ad tech infrastructure and the sales force as you build out this new initiative? And another big picture one, if I can. I want to play devil's advocate for a second. I agree you're under indexed on media revenue versus peers. However, it's also true that you're more vertical-focused focused on travel whereas a lot of those peers it's either more horizontal in nature, curious to hear how you think about that and how you think through potential ceilings on monetization? Thanks.","Steve Kaufer","Sure. Thanks, Justin. I love the question. So we're fortunate enough to have resources internally on the tech side that we were able to shift over. It includes some licensing and some buys not builds. But I wouldn't phrase it as a big multi-year lift to do this, because we already have $150 million-plus business built on a level of targeting and we just need to extend it make it easier for clients to buy programmatic and then build some additional ad units particularly video, fast-growing area, where we just don't have the product offering. So, I would say, small tech lift there.","On the sales force side, we're already very global. Of course, we need to add some more folks as we reach into different sets of clients that haven't historically been advertising on our site, but love the demographic that we represent. So we're probably pretty well covered in endemic. We feel like there's a lot of opportunity outside of travel with audience targeting.","As evidenced by the many other companies out there that do it pretty well. We are obviously pretty good at taking advantage of the vertical nature of our categories and we moved into that transaction as we go. But of all the people that go to TripAdvisor so many are purely in the research mode and they just are not ready to buy anything. That's a beautiful aspect of our site being a funnel for many others. So for the folks that aren't ready to buy, how do we monetize the ability to influence in one direction or another? And that's not a click off to an OTA. That's not a transaction of a private tour. That's a media opportunity to help educate a consumer on all the different stuff that they really should do. So we have a ton of influence in the category. We have a ton of traffic that is looking for something around their trip. And the more information, we can get about, who those folks are, the better we can do for overall general targeting. I hope that was helpful.","Justin Patterson","That was very helpful. Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Jed Kelly","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just speak on the new brand campaign, what the key message is going to be? And then can you provide any update on the amount you spent on television this quarter? And then one more if I can, any way you can give us some KPIs just around the membership opportunity in terms of percentage of MAUs or how many are converting to members?","Steve Kaufer","Thanks for the question. I'd say that I can't really share the details of the brand messaging in part, because it's evolving and in part we're not ready to launch at this point. But I can tell you it will be most likely be focused on aspects that are relatively unique to the TripAdvisor value proposition versus what the other set of travel players can provide. We have done a lot of research on our travelers, the awareness we have in different markets, and the irreplaceable value that we provide to so many travelers. So the brand campaign, we expect will highlight that delivered in unique and compelling ways across a wide variety of media.","Ernst Teunissen","In terms of the spend we spent $26 million on brand this quarter, which makes really the first half very comparable and spend almost the same as the year before. With all these changes that we're thinking about our brand advertising, it does not mean that we\u2019re increasing our budgets for it. So it shouldn't be incremental spend now or even in the following year. We're doing this all within our existing budget.","Jed Kelly","And should we expect to see the new television commercials this quarter?","Steve Kaufer","No. You would -- that would be far too early. What we have going for next year is -- and I want to back up. I wouldn't phrase it as just the television effort because we really do believe that there's a host of different media opportunities available for us. And as the branding rolls out later in the year and the advertising begins probably closer to next year, maybe that will help set your expectations.","Jed Kelly","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of -- we have Lee Horowitz from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Lee Horowitz","Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the SEO headwinds that you guys had called about. Obviously, Google has been moving more aggressively into travel products for a long time now. And I was wondering, what may be different in this quarter that warranted a headwind or impact on your business in a more meaningful way?","Steve Kaufer","Sure. So back up. We actually grew SEO traffic in 2018. That was -- I've mentioned many times, it is getting a lot harder due to Google pushing their own products. And by the way we think it's entirely appropriate for regulators to be looking into this practice, but frankly we're focused on what we can do about it. This past quarter they did a few things on the hotel front, which hurt a bit more than usual, but we've been working on a handful of initiatives, some of which we've already covered to counter that for a while.","So as we pointed out in the prepared remarks, member growth, app usage, building a stronger direct relationship with the travelers, new branding campaign. These are the sorts of things that we look to drive that deep consumer relationship that while we love the Google traffic, while we love all search engine and all social traffic as well, we're looking -- we've been implementing and have more on the horizon initiatives that enable us to own the relationship in a tighter way.","Lee Horowitz","Great. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of James Lee of Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.","James Lee","Yes, thanks for taking my questions. A couple of questions here. Just want to dig a little bit deeper about the trends in the second half here. Last quarter you mentioned for the hotel and media business you're expecting growth in the second half kind of implying third quarter will be growing.","I wonder what has changed. Is it more due to maybe the external environment where you see demand overall for travel is weak, or is it more due to internal decision where you want to cut down marketing expenses as a result of revenues coming down?","And secondly also on digital advertising I'm sure you guys know it's obviously a pretty competitive space. And I was wondering what new products are coming up that you feel confident that is differentiated and does the confident that you put in this product include the news feed product advertising we've been talking about over the last couple of quarters? And how should we think about the growth rate for the hotel and media business going to 2020? Thanks.","Ernst Teunissen","I'll start with the first part of the question. So, this year has been a year in which growth in our Hotels, Media & Platform business has been impacted by our decision to optimize the marketing expenditure and that has been a major impact on the growth rates as we've been calling out throughout as we believe those will start to abate by the end of the year and fully lapping in the first quarter.","So, from that we're expecting improvement. We are seeing growth for the first time to return in that segment in the first quarter and then we're well set up for the period beyond. You want to take the second?","Steve Kaufer","Yes and so for the media growth opportunity as I've mentioned the new video ad units, better programmatic access to specific audience, us understanding our own data in conjunction with other data which I'll just call it more enhanced segmentation allowing advertisers to buy that specific audience that they want and some of this -- or I might argue, most of this is not actually rocket science. It's just an area that we have not invested in, in the past. And so with a new level of focus, we've already seen some modest results, already rolled out a couple of additional products.","We mentioned there's some other ad products that are in beta now, be able to sponsor a location or sponsor the discovery of a location. And there are just a lot of both untapped media dialers in travel or endemic category and then a wide open opportunity. Of course, we have competition with that opportunity, but we have a ton of first party data unique to our massive audience at a global scale and that makes us a particularly nice compelling ad buy for quite a few folks looking for an extremely brand safe environment. ","James Lee","Great. Any commentary on growth rate for hotel and media business for 2020?","Ernst Teunissen","Sorry, can you repeat the question, sorry?","James Lee","Yeah. Any commentary on the revenue growth rate for the hotel and media business for 2020? ","Ernst Teunissen","Yeah. As we said, we are expecting to return to growth a little early to be more specific than that, we'll do that in the quarters to come. We obviously have highlighted the various puts and takes there, the return to a more level playing field around the marketing efficiencies, and as well as the ambition we have in the media space, which we believe we can at least double in the next three or five years.","James Lee","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Kevin Kopelman","Thanks a lot. I just had a follow-up on the HM&P revenue guide. So the second quarter was down, the revenue was down 4% ex currency. And it looks like you're expecting that to grow year-over-year in the fourth quarter. So in the interim, can you talk about how Q3 is looking for HM&P? Do you think it will \u2013 it will be better than Q2, or you see it \u2013 the full quarter of SEO headwinds making it similar or worse in Q2? Thanks.","Steve Kaufer","We're not putting too fine a point on it. Q3 will be still a quarter in which we'll have significantly lower marketing expense, which will be great for profitability, but it's still slowing the recovery of revenue growth. So Q3 will be another quarter in which we experience that. Really in Q4, we see a more meaningful start of the lap of the marketing performance and that's why we call out Q4 as the moment where the segment can come to growth.","Kevin Kopelman","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then \u2013 and on that Q4 the confidence there returning to growth is that really across the segment? And how much of it is driven by what you anticipate in the display side for the fourth quarter versus really the display and also the TripAdvisor rated hotels?","Steve Kaufer","Yeah. It's a combination of the increased lapping into the marketing performances that we will see, but also we have some exciting things in the works on the media side and we expect positive impact from that in Q3 and more in Q4.","Kevin Kopelman","Okay. Great. And just one other \u2013 just quick follow-up. I've talked about kind of the SEO headwinds. It sounds like start or maybe exacerbating kind of mid-quarter and second quarter. Have you ever seen SEO driven revenue down before or was 2019 would expect that to be the first year that would happen?","Steve Kaufer","We've seen our growth rates decelerate over the years. But I've kind of been talking about this for quite a while as Google continues to move into travel. The notion comes back to with this trend that's been going on for several years, how we take control of that customer \u2013 control is perhaps a bad word, how we help that customer and encourage the relationship so that they can continually come back to us?","And with our growth in membership becomes as we mentioned in our published remarks the improved repeat rate, the improved monetization, and the improved loyalty to TripAdvisor. So we're particularly excited about the growth in our membership numbers. You should expect more from us in that store, and that helps address a number of the other concerns around the business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Stan Velikov","Good morning. This is Stan for Brent. Thank you for taking my question. I was just wondering from what you know so far about your brand spend. Is it helping drive more incremental traffic to the platform, or it\u2019s more shifting I think from paid to direct channels?","Steve Kaufer","Thanks for the question. It's hard for us to know that, because we're blessed with so much traffic in so many of our points-of-sale and our pure branding campaigns tend to be in our larger markets. It's a little hard to -- we know we are getting some additional audience, but the purpose of the campaign was really to drive different behavior of the people who already knew us. And so we've seen consistent improvement in conversion on our things to do section on TripAdvisor. Some of that is going to be the brand campaign. Some of that is going to be converted on the site, better implementations, better supply teasing out the differences are, but we know the brand campaigns have been helping the TripAdvisor point-of-sale.","Stan Velikov","I got it. And one more question. Can you give us some color on international trends? Any specific markets or regions to go out?","Ernst Teunissen","Nothing really to highlight at this point. We see pretty uniform trends across the globe at this point. We called out in the past that we saw some softness particularly in Europe that has started to converge. So we don't see a particular area and we see actually the upside from all the initiatives that we are currently deploying in all our markets across the world.","Stan Velikov","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. I'm showing no additional questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to CEO, Steve Kaufer for any closing remarks.","Steve Kaufer","Great. Well, thank you everyone for joining the call. In closing, I want to thank our global travel community because you make the TripAdvisor stay better every day and we will work tirelessly to deliver you great products to help you experience the world. I also want to thank our partners. We will continue to deliver offerings that enable you to drive your business.","And finally I want to thank all of the TripAdvisor media group and employees around the world. We have a lot of exciting work ahead. And I look forward to updating everyone next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day."],"20899":["TripAdvisor, Inc.

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to your TripAdvisor's Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Will Lyons. Please, go ahead.","Will Lyons","Thanks, Kyla. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our call. Joining me today are Steve Kaufer, our CEO; Ernst Teunissen, our CFO; and Chief Experience and Brand Officer, Lindsay Nelson. Last night, after market closed, we distributed and filed our fourth quarter and year-end 2019 earnings release and we made available our shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website located at ir.tripadvisor.com.","In the release, you will find reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures discussed on this call. Also on our IR site, you will find supplemental financial information, which includes certain non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, as well as other performance metrics.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that this call may contain estimates and other forward-looking statements that represent management's views as of today, February 13, 2020. TripAdvisor disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. Please refer to our earnings release, as well as our filings with the SEC for information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements.","Now, here's Steve, who will share a few thoughts before we open the call up to your questions.","Steve Kaufer","Thank you, Will, and good morning, everyone. As we outlined in our shareholder letter, challenging 2019 hotel auction trends persisted in Q4, though our financial results were in line with our lowered expectations. We've taken action in our three important focus areas.","Specifically, we've continued to focus on driving revenue growth outside of the hotel auction, we adjusted our cost structure to support continued strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, and we will return a total of $548 million of capital to shareholders through a special dividend and share buyback.","We also closed two acquisitions that further bolster our fast-growing restaurant offering in Q4. More recently, we reorganized to align teams on a One TripAdvisor vision. These changes bring together and streamline the TripAdvisor user and shopping experience, leveraging our differentiated people-powered planning consumer value proposition.","Our target travelers wants to take a trip that's really important to them, come to us to plan that entire trip. We therefore expect our non-hotel auction revenue will drive the lion's share of our future growth. We expect E&D revenue alone will exceed the hotel auction in 2020. And over the coming years, the relative sizes of these revenue lines will reduce the hotel auction's influence on our overall results.","In summary, we are enhancing our position in an attractive and competitive travel market and clearly differentiating ourselves from every other travel company. We continue to have strong unique assets and our progress makes us optimistic about our future.","We'll now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Deepak Mathivanan with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Deepak Mathivanan","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Two quick questions. So, first, can you talk about the trends in Hotel auction business during 4Q versus third quarter? Did Google impact get worse or was it largely stable? And did your commentary on the revenue growth improving in second half of 2020 depend on Google's efforts being relatively stable? Or can you do it, just, largely given the comps?","And then the second question a little bit more near term. Can you comment on what you're seeing from the coronavirus impact so far, in terms of traffic and maybe the OTA partner bidding activity related to that? How are you thinking about that in the guidance too? Thank you. ","Steve Kaufer","Sure. Hi, Deepak, this is Steve. Thanks for the question. Hotel auction was stable Q3 to Q4, but it's still challenged. What we're doing about it is, building direct relationships with our travelers and you can see that in the increased membership rates. With this direct relationship, we're getting more repeat traffic and a higher percentage of our revenues coming from these members. And that's great for our long-term health of our business.","Perhaps just as important, we're focused on extending this relationship we have with the traveler to beyond hotel, to help them on the full trip. Say you're going to Cancun, the hotel is important, but you should definitely consider any number of the tours that we offer to really make that trip special. And how about some restaurants?","And all that stuff is working. As you can see more travelers on TripAdvisor are booking experiences than ever before, and our media and reservation businesses are -- they're growing double-digits. In terms of the SEO impact later in 2020, look, we always assume some continued Google headwinds but nothing dramatic. Nothing like that is baked into our plan.","To your second question, the coronavirus. One has to believe it's part of our softer start in the Hotel auction for us. And we do see some unexpected or new cancellation levels in Asia, but we're not that exposed to Asia as an overall part of our business. So, we're watching it closely. We might see a point or two or low-single-digits impact. But at this point, it's there. We're watching it closely. It's not that material to us.","Deepak Mathivanan","Got it. Thank you. Very helpful.","Steve Kaufer","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Chris on for Lloyd. I believe you guys had called out exiting the year at 30% booking growth in the Experiences business. So can you just talk a bit about how you're thinking about the shape of bookings growth this year?","And then separately, we've seen some press that indicates you guys may be in the process of flexing the pricing lever in the Experiences business. And I was curious if you guys could give us some color on how that's factored into the guidance for E&D segment revenue to accelerate this year? Thanks.","Steve Kaufer","Sure. Thanks. This is Steve again. So, we're super bullish on our overall Experiences & Dining segment and Experiences in particular. Internally we've changed things around to really focus both on the TripAdvisor opportunity, which has been growing strongly as we told you to help center around the traveler and whether that traveler is looking at a hotel or a restaurant or an experience help that traveler finish that considered trips.","So, we look at bookings growth rate on TripAdvisor as remaining strong. When we look at Viator, which is the other part of our change, we're adding a bunch more focus on that platform. And with that focus as a pure-play for Experiences, we're excited about its reacceleration in terms of bookings growth and overall focus for the year.","In terms of the pricing question, our marketplace had grown dramatically over the past several years and we discovered that there were parts of the marketplace that frankly weren't fair to a number of suppliers given different suppliers had some different margins on the platform and we wanted to fix that.","We firmly believe in a fair marketplace for all of our suppliers and a fair marketplace is going to give the best results for travelers, no matter where they're traveling. I don't think that's a big impact on overall financial, but it is important for the health of the marketplace.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thanks.","Steve Kaufer","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Naved Khan with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Naved Khan","Yeah. Thanks a lot. A couple of questions. So, on the E&D side, how should we think about the potential for organic growth in 2020 in their business? And how is the restructuring going to affect revenue growth?","And then, on the Hotel side, as we think about your commentary on the decel you saw in January. What are the primary factors for that? Did one of your partners' pull back spending?","Ernst Teunissen","Hey, Naved, this is Ernst. Thanks for your questions. First on Experiences & Dining., we have made two impressive acquisitions. They are going to help with the reacceleration of growth that we highlighted. But we are, as Steve just said, also very bullish on the organic prospects we have into the business.","On the Dining side, we've seen continued strong performance from Viator. They've been able to continue to -- sorry of LaFourchette, they've been able to continue their organic growth and we expect them to continue their organic growth as they have been. They are pushing deeper into secondary and tertiary markets other cities. They are making progress on loyalty of their customers repeat the rate to their customers so very solid piece of the business.","On the Experiences side, as Steve was just saying, we see opportunities as well. We see an opportunity to integrate the Experiences business deeper in the overall TripAdvisor offering and benefit from being able to offer experiences not only to people of the Experiences pages, but also on other parts of their travel. Viator, we believe we can reinvigorate the positioning and the growth of that business. And so we feel very good about the overall impacts of that.","You asked about restructuring impacts. Yes, we have taken out some costs out of the Experiences business in particular within the E&D segment. We have got -- come out of a period of about three, four years of significant investment. We have more than doubled our cost in Experiences for instance in the last few years to build a supply base which we have done very aggressively and we are very happy with now and build like our systems for a larger scale.","And we feel we've come out of that investment cycle and we're now pivoting towards focusing more on the demand side which is less labor-intensive than the first and the supply build has been. So, we felt we could take out some costs. We don't believe that's going to have a meaningful impact on our ability to execute for the rest of the year.","Naved Khan","That's helpful. And then on the Hotel auction piece. Can you just give some color on decel?","Ernst Teunissen","Yes sorry. The deceleration we saw early in the year on the Hotel side, not so much due to partner bidding levels, but more to an overall -- the continuation of the Google trends, but maybe an overall travel spending and coronavirus impact that we've seen and we've seen that decelerate versus what we saw in Q4.","As we look ahead, of course, what we're focused on super focused on, on the Hotel business is making sure we grow the non-auction lines. We have some ambitious plan for 2020 for our hotel B2B business which was growing double-digits last year and we have aggressive growth plans for this year.","And of course, our Media business Lindsay is on the line and she's going to talk later more undoubtedly about our Media business. But we see a reacceleration of our media business as well into 2020 and these will offset some of the pressures we've seen in the auction.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shweta Khajuria with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Shweta Khajuria","Great. Thanks. Two questions please. First, member growth that accelerated for the sixth consecutive quarter I believe that's from the letter in the fourth quarter. Could you provide a little bit more context around member versus non-member trends? So, how much more do they spend or how much more do they engage? What is their demographic profile versus non-members? Any context there?","And then second your fiscal year 2020 guide calls for Experiences & Dining to be higher than auctions revenue. I don't believe you break out auctions, but any context on how big that is as a part of the branded Hotels revenue? Could we assume 70% 80% of that revenue is auctions? Thanks.","Steve Kaufer","Sure. Thanks Shweta. This is Steve; I'll take the first question. Member growth does continue to accelerate that's a lot of fresh users who had been coming by our site haven't found a reason to log in and now they're doing so. That allows us to reach out to them again through our CRM efforts. We added 50 million as we indicated in 2019 and we're on a great pace going into 2020.","Members do come back more, no surprise there. They are a higher percentage of our overall revenue is now coming from members as I had said. And while we're not kind of ready to share specific numbers about increased monetization rates every great business builds its loyalty based upon people view themselves as members signing in as one attribute. We're just coming back to main direct, coming back for more and more of their travel purchases.","Critical to this kind of focus of ours and it really is a focus and you can see the results is that considered trip in helping those members plan not just what they originally started on for TripAdvisor, but the rest of that travel cycle. They started on a restaurant. They become a member that's fantastic. We can help them with the experience with the hotel, with the flight, et cetera.","Ernst Teunissen","And Shweta to your second question the -- our TripAdvisor branded Hotels line consists of two main components of the auction as well as our hotel B2B business. Without putting a finer point on the split between the two, you're correct to assume that a large majority of that revenue today is in the auction. The other part the B2B Hotel business is the part that is growing. It's been growing last year. We expect it to grow nicely this year as well. So as we -- over time we see within the Hotel line the auction be less impactful and especially less impactful within the overall HM&P revenue line.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brad Erickson with Needham & Company. Your line is now open.","Brad Erickson","Hi, thanks. I guess can you just give any kind of a finer sense of what promoted listings video ads stuff like that ended up being financially last year as you've gotten started? I guess that one might be for Lindsay. And just kind of how big of a contributor we should expect that to be here in 2020? And then also can you just give the updated monthly active users on the site in Q4?","Steve Kaufer","Sure. This is Steve. Could you clarify the promoted ads? That's not really the term we use. Are you referring to our sponsored placements or us....","Ernst Teunissen","Our media business.","Steve Kaufer","Our media business [Indiscernible].","Brad Erickson","The sponsored placements I guess is what I was getting at the piece of the business. I know it was small, but I think it was roughly doubling last year. Just ended up wondering if you got there and kind of how much of a contributor that becomes in 2020?","Ernst Teunissen","It was again another nice growth rate for that product. It's a very popular product for our customers. A significant part of the growth that we've seen this year in our hotel B2B was as a result of our continued growth in sponsor placements. We expect that to continue to grow into 2020. It's not the only growth area in B2B in 2020. We have some new products that we're building out that are B2B products for our hotel base. So sponsor placement plus other products, we see continue to drive hotel B2B revenue next year.","In terms of overall users, the decline of the users narrowed in Q4. We had a little over 380 million users in Q4. Q4 of course is a seasonably low number for users compared to is it Q3? The point remains that we have huge scale and the overall new users is only a fraction of what we really look at. We look underneath. We look at membership growth. We look at the quality of these users. And we've highlighted in our prepared remarks a few of the great green shoots that we've seen there.","We're particularly excited about being able to grow membership, because membership -- members just have a better ability for us to market to especially on e-mail, but they also tend to be much more loyal and much more higher revenue generating. So we look at underneath and -- we look at the underneath -- the trends underneath the 380 million users and we're actually quite pleased with where that's trending.","Brad Erickson","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Brian Fitzgerald","Thanks guys. I had a couple of questions with -- around the engagement on TripAdvisor media manager and then some color there on the mix and dynamics between ramping endemic versus non-endemic clients. And then related question with TripAdvisor Connect, it's your new self-serve off platform kind of audience extension media solution. What are the puts and takes there for advertisers? Is it -- may we get a holistic view of our travel marketing spend and ROI in one place and one dashboard and we don't have to hassle with managing multiple DSPs? Would they get better rates there versus going directly to a DSP? Can you give us some color there on TripAdvisor Connect?","Lindsay Nelson","Yes. Thanks, Brian for the question. To take it up a notch I mean we remain pretty optimistic about the potential of the display business given the massive scale that Ernst just talked about. And we're also pretty proud of the brand-safe environment and the access to first-party data, particularly in a world where identity and authentication of one user base is getting harder and harder for many other publishers in this basis very much connects with our ambition around membership. The more logged in members, the more people we have a deep understanding of and the better we can attribute them on behalf of our marketing partners.","So to your question around TripAdvisor Connect, the challenge many marketers have is once you identify a high-value audience, how can you continue to remarket and start a conversation with that audience whether they're on TripAdvisor or off platform. So that's a product that meets that demand. We're seeing a lot of interest in that product. It's already starting to grow quickly, particularly with both endemic and non-endemic advertisers. Just to give you some highlights as we closed out the year the leading indicator that we continue to pay attention to as to whether or not we can grow -- double this business in three to five years is whether we're growing our new customer base. We added over 200 new advertisers in Q4.","We also increased our average deal size. We grew average deal size by about 20%. And I think that's a pretty remarkable achievement to not only continue to grow your customers to be able to maintain pricing integrity in the overall deal volume and the impact of each of those deals. We've also increased our programmatic business relative to the overall growth in the market.","Programmatic of the channel for us grew by 100%. And we continue to grow monetizable inventory across the sites and increase sell rates. So when you think about the spectrum of the market and to your question around the self-service platform, we believe that we have great solutions for enterprise partners to do multiyear deals particularly around exclusive data relationships.","But we also think we can serve that small and medium-sized business through the self-serve platform. And if you look the other vertical on the matrix, we believe, we can meet the highly transactional programmatic buyer, but also introduce high-touch solutions like branded content like sponsorships. And so far the market has been reacting pretty positively.","Brian Fitzgerald","Great. Thanks, Lindsay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom White with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.","Phil Rigby","Hey, it's actually Phil Rigby on for Tom. So the letter you talked about conversion gains with experienced shoppers and how to accelerate it. I was hoping you could just elaborate a bit on your initiatives there and how you're driving better conversions and experiences?","And then maybe can you talk about those 10 products rolled out in Q3 and how those are performing? I think you touched on some of those earlier in the call. And just lastly, any more color you can give us on your product pipeline would be great? Thank you.","Steve Kaufer","This is Steve. I'll take the Experiences conversion. I might ask you after I finish to repeat the second question. So with the Experiences it's a two-part answer. On TripAdvisor, we're getting better and better at helping travelers no matter where they are in the funnel, discover the experiences and make it very easy for them to buy the right experience around that point of interest. So if it's a Buckingham Palace, is it a guided tour, is it a skip the line, is it a private tour, what's the best experience -- what's the best thing that we can offer to help sell that particular attraction.","On Viator, the fact that we have so much more choice and that we're improving our ability with the streamlined methods to actually complete the purchase still a bunch of low-hanging fruit that we're excited to tackle that we started on over the past several quarters and have a rather robust roadmap to help our travelers on that particular point-of-sale.","I reiterate the focus that our recent changes are allowing us to pursue in terms of helping the traveler throughout the trip on TripAdvisor, makes us extremely bullish given the hundreds of millions of travelers on our site, planning a considered trip.","And then on Viator, occupying the mind share around being the place to go to have that magical experience whether I discover Viator when I'm in destination or whether I'm a planner and I'm picking out the absolute best hike or tour or Vatican experience or whatever.","Could I ask you to repeat the second question?","Phil Rigby","Yeah. That's very helpful. Thanks. And then -- so you -- on your last call you talked about two or 10 new product launches that you rolled out over Q3. Just wanted to get any more color on how those are performing or what your product pipeline looks like for 2020?","Steve Kaufer","I don't think we referred to 10 products. We had launched a couple on the ad side that Lindsay had covered in the last answer. And certainly there are different ad units on our site, different than a rectangle or we have a new homepage placement that we've been talking about.","I give -- the short answer is it's all part of the mix that makes us comfortable with continued with our estimation that we'll still be able -- continue that we are executing on our plan to double our media revenue over the next three to five years.","We're not sure any one product is going to be a breakaway hit. But our strategy is really to focus on our audience, segmenting it for the right buyer, and leveraging the fact that we have so much first-party data, which is becoming scarcer across the media universe.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Jed Kelly","Great and thanks for taking my question. In the prepared comments, in the E&D segment, both seated diners and bookings, you mentioned they grew over 30%. And revenue in that segment, I think grew 20% ex-FX.","Can you just talk about what the gap is, between your key KPIs and the overall revenue growth?","Ernst Teunissen","Yes. Seated diners and bookings are obviously volume indicators, particularly in Experiences. And we've highlighted this before this year. We've made a push into new products, with a lower AOV.","So they have lowered our revenue per booking. And that may be a short-term impact, as we just sign up more -- new customers with offering them more attractively priced lower AOV products. But that has been the main driver on the Experiences side.","On the dining side, there has been less of a shift between mobile -- between volume and pricing, year-over-year. As we look forward into next year, we see an opportunity for both of those segments to keep driving volume, but also have opportunities to keep driving AOV as well.","And so we look ahead. And we believe this is a great -- both of these metrics are great leading indicators, for what we can do over time.","Jed Kelly","And then, on Experiences and on the cost rationalization, has that impacted how you're thinking about your overall marketing that product in 2020?","Ernst Teunissen","The cost rationalization, I want to be very clear has been on the back of a number of years really deeply investing, particularly in supply growth and overall platform growth, the overall scalability of our platform. ","We've been growing as you have been able to see in our statistics bookable products very aggressively, triple-digit type of growth, that we've seen. We feel now we're in a very good place. We've made a big spurt.","We thought it was important to make a big spurt of available inventory. We have that now. We're shifting now towards the less labor-intensive activity of pushing on the demand side.","So we have a lot of initiatives that we're driving to stimulate demand. And we've shifted our focus that way. It doesn't have a direct implication on how we can execute on that side, the fact that we've tapered our expenses on the other side.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is now open.","Eric Sheridan","Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe two, if I can. First on the auction dynamic, is there any way we can get a little additional color on, whether its advertisers adjusting budget?","How much of it is macro industry issues, versus pricing dynamics, versus budget dynamics, that you're seeing in the auction. And how you're -- maybe the assumptions you're making looking out to 2020. And how those might change from what you saw in 2019.","And then on Experiences, could you help to frame, how you see the competitive landscape in Experiences playing out from 2020 and beyond? There's a lot of players in travel, albeit, probably not at the scale you guys are at today of inventory, trying to go after that opportunity.","So how do you see the competitive landscape playing out, especially reflected in trying to continue to scale inventory and choice for consumers in Experiences? Thanks so much.","Ernst Teunissen","Yeah. Eric, I'll take the first. And then, Steve will take the second one. In terms of the auction, there have been a number of factors at play. The macro, we believe is important. The continuation of Google is important. The overall willingness to transact of users is important.","Of course advertisers are adjusting their budgets accordingly, when they're on other platforms. So it's sometimes a little bit difficult to tease apart, But we putted in the bucket of some of these external headwinds that are coming on overall travel spending by consumers, as the most important driver.","Steve Kaufer","And on the Experiences side, let's all remember, 80% of the bookings are done off-line. And so when you look at -- with the TripAdvisor brand, lens on we have so many of those travelers already on our site. Our job is to match that traveler demand either in planning mode or in destination. We don't have to pay additional dollars to get those travelers. It's a clear advantage we have over basically every other competitor in the attraction space. When you look at Viator, we did supply footprint certainly in the markets where we are strong, we're sort of a clear leader a clear player with all of the heavy not all, but most of the heavy lifting already done in terms of building the supply footprint and infrastructure.","So when you compare Viator's closer to stand-alone entity versus their head-to-head competitors, certainly, we believe we stand ahead and we stand tall. We have better supply. We have a ton of traffic. We have more direct traffic more brand awareness. It's really quite a good story that we plan to leverage going forward. Great markets bring lots of competitors. So we're not particularly nervous about other pure-play attraction players. We're certainly watching carefully because the market is so big and had such nice growth opportunities.","Operator","Next question comes from Mike Olson with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.","Mike Olson","Hey, good morning. So related to the E&D segment and particularly looking at Experiences it sounds like there's a high degree of confidence in continued growth there. And you talked about new ways to engage and convert users but are there also just certain regions or categories that just may have more opportunity for growth or less penetrated that you're looking into? And I guess along those lines are there also been areas where supplies may be less robust today that you're particularly working on? Thanks.","Steve Kaufer","Yeah. Excellent question, there's certainly a plethora of opportunity around the globe. And so we do have to focus in on certain areas. We're not trying to do everything in every geography. So, naturally we go where we already have good supply footprint and\/or a great traffic footprint, particularly on the TripAdvisor point-of-sale so that we at least come with either a strong supply footprint or a strong demand footprint as opposed to having to start from scratch in either. That's pretty much how you can see our product strategy, our supply strategy, and our demand strategy rolling out between TripAdvisor and Viator leveraging either a supply or a demand footprint.","And there will be other players we recognize that. That grab of foothold in a market that we're not particularly strong in at the moment. However, our overall considered trip with our current audience where we can bring the demand, if we don't have the supply ourselves we cut the supply relationships with somebody else perhaps. There's lots of different ways to do what's right for our traveler.","Ernst Teunissen","And Steve answered this question mostly for Experiences. But if you look at the dining side there are exciting opportunities there as well. And these two acquisitions that, we've been making are supporting that as well. LaFourchette with its transactional business has been able to grow in the footprint that they've had within Europe because it's still underpenetrated. But the acquisition with Bookatable that we've made allowed us to more deeply penetrate the U.K. and Germany which were two white spaces for LaFourchette which is very exciting. LaFourchette will now be a truly pan-European player and able to leverage the scale associated with it. Last year \u2013 earlier last year we made an acquisition in South America as you know which is another growth market that we're focusing on. So on the transactional business, there's a lot of growth opportunity ahead geographically but also deeper penetration within market that we ahead of us.","And then the other component of this \u2013 of restaurants as you know is the products that we're selling through restaurants restaurateurs on TripAdvisor, which is our restaurant services business that we've been able to grow very nicely. The other acquisition we made single platform is an ability to add more product to the sales force that is selling these two restaurants on TripAdvisor. And so it's highly synergistic. We've bought a company that was not growing as part of the platform that they were on. But we are able to take that and put that on top of the sales force that we've created and offer more product to the same restaurant. So another area of product additions, product proliferation for restaurants is another nice growth area on the TripAdvisor restaurant services side.","Operator","Our next question is from Justin Patterson with Raymond James. Your line is now open. ","Justin Patterson","Great. Thank you. Could you expand on the redesign of the TripAdvisor app? You change the user experience not that long ago. So I'm curious how this redesign compares to the last, what you're trying to solve and how we should think through the business impact?","And then the second question is on Experiences. Steve, I think, you just said 80% of attractions are still booked off-line. Where would you say the industry is in that shift from off-line to online? And what can you do to accelerate that shift to convert more bookings online?","Steve Kaufer","That's terrific two-parter. I'll ask Lindsay to handle the first, and you'll see how it dovetails nicely with the second.","Lindsay Nelson","All right. Thanks, Mike for the question about the app as we shared a few months ago. We've been in the process of overhauling the app for about two quarters now and we have about two quarters more to go. As you can appreciate these projects are not only about what the consumer sees, but also how we manage the back-end services that support not only app, but that will also improve the web platform experience.","Overall our ambition is just to create world-class consumer products and that includes not only the planning experience, but also the shopping and booking experience. And while there's a lot to love about the current app we think there's a lot of areas of improvement to not only make it much more lightweight, but also just much more reactive and personalized and intuitive for the traveler.","We recognize that the travel planning process happens across many surfaces. Sometimes that happens on your phone. Sometimes it happens on your desktop. Sometimes you want to exchange e-mails with your travel partner to compare the best hotel or a really exciting tour. And we don't make it easy to hand off across those platforms. We really want the app to be that, sort of, in-your-pocket hub for all of your travel planning moments, but also your on destination companion where you can not only organize all of the things that you've booked on TripAdvisor, but also discover great deals, last minute opportunities or recommendations from travelers like you.","I would say that the most important thing to take away for this group is just the importance of personalization and ongoing member communications. We recognize that not every traveler is the same. It's important that we don't have a blend instrument experience.","And so we believe that on the back of the membership opportunity, which is why we sequenced the focus on membership in advance of the launch of the app that the more logged in users we have the more questions we ask as users, the more information we have about what your travel preferences are the better recommendations in merchandising we can do across any category on TripAdvisor.","And we believe that the combination of data collection within membership and the delivery of that through the new experience is not only going to increase engagements and repeat users but it will ultimately drive revenue because each app user will be given an app experience that is tailored to their preferences and we're pretty excited about that.","Steve Kaufer","And as you can imagine downloading and being a frequent user of the app is an ultimate sign of loyalty. And so when we look at that 80% off-line experience purchase a chunk of it is I have no reason to book in advance and all of a sudden TripAdvisor and Viator are now giving you a reason because of convenience. You can always cancel 24 hours before the thing. There's a different payment methods. There's potentially deals and there's just the convenience of buying through a safe channel like TripAdvisor or Viator in advance.","And then for all those things that you put on your wish list not ready not because you don't like the tour you're just not sure if you're ready to take it. Now you're in destination you open up our app and there it is in that exact same format and now you're ready to buy it because heaven forbid it's now sold out. And with the app continue push notifications telling you that hey inventory is getting limited or now is a good time or here are some three other things you might want to do.","Imagine it down the road how incredibly helpful it can be to have a travel agent, a travel wizard in your pocket giving you recommendations based on where you are, what the weather is like, the things that we've learned about you to just make that in-destination travel experience so much easier, so much better. And that's the sign of loyalty that we feel we're in a great position to deliver.","To be clear, that is not a Q3 launch. A Q3 launch is the beginning of the app. It's a new surface. We're very excited about it. It's the \u2013 what I talked about was the several year vision of how the traveler becomes super loyal to us because of all the services that we're providing both in planning and in-destination.","Justin Patterson","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Wasiolek with Morningstar. Your line is now open.","Dan Wasiolek","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Two if I may. So the first one on marketing expense, which saw some pretty strong leverage in 2019. How should we think about your ability to continue to optimize channels and the impact you're increasing loyalty member base and the app relaunch might have on direct traffic in 2020 and beyond? And should we think about marketing expense leverage potentially again in 2020? And then just in regards to Google, it looks like it might be testing place in some organic links above its meta in some markets. If that were to become prominent, how might that impact your business? That's it for me. Thank you.","Ernst Teunissen","Thank, Dan. This is Ernst. On marketing first. We've gone through a serious effort as you know over the last few years in improving the efficiency of our marketing on the Hotel side. We're through that cycle now. So going forward on the auction side, we expect to \u2013 marketing to grow with demand grow with overall revenue volume.","The same actually for our growth businesses for Experiences, for Dining, we see marketing grow with overall volume. To your point of channel diversification and will reinvigorate app help us actually lower marketing cost. That is definitely a potential. Not baked into our numbers at the moment or our forecast at the moment but that is definitely a potential that we are able to reduce our dependence on some of these paid marketing channels.","Steve Kaufer","This is Steve. With regard to the test that Google seems to be doing putting an organic link above some of their placements. We'll see how it goes. Far, far too early to tell whether that's a no effect or a modest positive. But a little hard for me to believe that it would be meaningful from what I've seen so far.","Dan Wasiolek","Great. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lee Horowitz with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Lee Horowitz","Great. Thanks so much for the question. Just one if I could. On the reshuffling of the management team and the alignment in the Experiences business, focusing on Viator as a separate product and Experiences on TripAdvisor as it's their own kind of stand-alone business. Why was this the right timing to seemingly break these two businesses somewhat apart given that you've tried to integrate them a little bit more closely over the last couple of years?","Steve Kaufer","Thanks, Lee for the question. Excited to answer. We had a plan many years ago when we first bought Viator. First turning it into a marketplace from very curated selection growing supply. Doing it geographically and leveraging the demand that existed on the TripAdvisor and the Viator platform. And we needed to teach ourselves how to best merchandise Experience\u2019s having been kind of \u2013 from the TripAdvisor side not in that business for \u2013 previously.","And so the one team that was responsible both for TripAdvisor and for Viator was leveraging all those new learnings for how to effectively sell Experience\u2019s to travelers. With several years now of getting that into our DNA, we're now able to split it off and say \"For TripAdvisor we've got the merchandising down. Let's now tackle how an Experience is part of a key considered trip.\" And that's a little bit of a different muscle that's very unique to TripAdvisor because of all the traffic we have across all of the verticals. So reorganization apply a focus towards helping that traveler on TripAdvisor, no matter whether they're looking for a restaurant, a hotel or an Experience.","Flip it back over to Viator. Now we have an opportunity as a pure-play OTA for experiences to really build up both the brand, the focus on the merchandising and just the Viator point-of-sale, leveraging our third party relationships of which there are quite a few and focus from a set of consumers are looking for just the best thing to do while they're in destination or beforehand.","And while some may go to TripAdvisor, which will be great for TripAdvisor Media group, they will be a set that are just looking for a pure-play experiences offering and we want Viator to have all the leverage to win in that space.","So it's kind of like, it was always part of what we thought would happen and I think we timed it well in terms of being able to have both sides learn the merchandising, learn the best practices and then enable each brand to chase its audience.","Ernst Teunissen","And the other component of this reorg of course is this focus on TA and the overall TA platform, which is really important to us. We have developed TA very attractively vertical by vertical. There's a huge opportunity that we outlined in looking at the consumer much more holistically. And with great hires that we made with Lindsay and Kanika, we feel we have the right plan in place right now to actually affect that.","Lee Horowitz","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Doug Anmuth","Thanks for taking the questions. Just want to ask two. First, can you just give us some more color on how your brand campaign will evolve in 2020? You talked about optimizing and reducing some investments. If you could just help us kind of quantify 2019 and 2020.","And then separately just on the at least flat EBITDA in 2020 relative to 2019. Can you just talk more about some of the bigger puts and takes there and just how we should think about top line growth that's contemplated in the guide? Thanks.","Lindsay Nelson","Yes. Thanks, Doug. So I'll give you a little bit of big picture color on the brand campaign. So last year when I joined we initiated a brand transformation. And when I think about what it means to transform a brand especially one as iconic as TripAdvisor, it's not just about a paid marketing campaign. It's about how do we design and reset, how we think about the target customer, the role we play within travel and ultimately define strategically and creatively what it means for us to be the world's preeminent people-powered guidance company.","The first external signal of that transformation was a very exciting moment for us a couple of weeks ago where we relaunched the visual identity of the company including a simplification of the iconic Ollie logo. And consumers will continue to see rolling updates not only across the platform, but also all of the channels that we own and operate over the next couple of months.","We will be in market in April with a pretty high impact, but targeted city campaign where the company will do out-of-home for the first time, particularly in major transit hubs like airports and subways and train stations. We will continue to think about what our communication strategy is for the first half of the year. And as we look into the back half right now, we are acutely focused on the channels that we actually own and operate that we don't pay for.","As we talked about earlier, we have an enormous very valuable audience. Historically, we haven't necessarily taken advantage of that audience. Using open inventory to merchandise and promote our businesses, such as the growing experiences opportunity on TripAdvisor. So we'll have a big focus there.","The second is CRM. As Steve said, it's sort of a simple acronym, but what it means is for all of these new members -- these are people we can connect and communicate to directly. And CRM as a channel has been very fast-growing for us not only in volume, but efficacy. And we expect to double the revenue contribution from that channel this coming year.","And that extends of course into push, as we continue to grow app downloads even in advance of launch. Again, that's a coveted audience that we have a direct line into.","From there, we'll look to the back half, as we identify what our specific campaign objectives are. And as we have an understanding of how the business is doing, we'll put our back half media plan together and allocate the budget accordingly.","Ernst Teunissen","As you can tell from what Lindsay says, TV marketing as we've done in previous years, it's going to have less of an overall weight in the way we go-to-market with our brand. The other ways we go-to-market with the brand as Lindsay outlined are going to be more efficient and effective we believe. And so we're looking at a reduction year-over-year in our overall brand budget from last year. It's one of the areas where we've seen cost efficiency for the upcoming year.","In terms of your second question on the puts and takes in -- or at least flat EBITDA outlook for 2020. Let's start with E&D. E&D is a source for profit growth in 2020 for us. Not only does the top line continue to develop very nicely. We are also seeing improved margins in E&D this upcoming year. It's partly from the scale, we are achieving in dining, it's partly from the scale we are achieving in experiences.","And as you know and as we have outlined, we've taken some cost out of the experiences business as well. And so that combines to a meaningful profit improvement for the year.","The other part of the puts and takes is our Hotel auction. The pressure on the Hotel auction is putting some challenges on the profitability of that particular line item. And then thirdly, we have identified other cost savings areas that we have outlined in our prepared remarks as well.","There are three: There's experiences there's other areas of the business where -- that are less strategic or we can take some efficiency work taking some cost out and then the brand marketing I just talked about.","We're partly reinvesting about half of it -- of the savings of $80 million of our run rate that we're creating. We're reinvesting in growth areas of the business in our restaurant business in particular, but also in building capabilities around our core Experiences Lindsay's area as well as the Hotel B2B. So partly reinvesting by taking some efficiencies. So that all together combines in our outlook for the year of at least flat EBITDA.","Operator","And our next question comes from Nat Schindler with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Nat Schindler","Was wondering - I don't know if it was really clearly answered but I think I just wanted to ask what portion of the Hotel-branded TripAdvisor-branded Hotel revenue is auctions? Because I'm trying to clarify your guidance on trying to figure out how much of E&D is going up? And then if you could give at least some partial direction on how much of the E&D growth is acquisition-related.","Ernst Teunissen","n terms of the auction as a percentage of the TA-branded hotel I said it's a large majority. We're not breaking it out but it's a large majority. And Shweta produced some percentages on it. And directionally she's correct in thinking it's a large majority of that business.","In terms of E&D inorganic contribution, so we made two acquisitions, last year stand-alone businesses in 2019. They created about $50 million, 5-0 million, of revenue with a flat bottom line with no profitability. The component in Q4 -- of our Q4 financials was very de-minimis. We made these two acquisitions at the very end of the year -- at the end of December and so it didn't have a meaningful impact at all on Q4.","Going forward we're looking at these two assets as incredibly powerful add-ons to the overall dining business. As a standalone businesses they were actually growth-challenged, but we think we can reinvigorate that on top of our platform. And it's going to be a part of what we do next year. Organically as we have said a number of times we also believe we can meaningfully continue growth or in part accelerate the growth that we've seen before.","Nat Schindler","Okay. One other clarifying question, what other than auction is in the TripAdvisor-branded Hotel just for clarification? And then a second additional question, is it -- can you go back over the last -- it's about two years. Your E&D margins have kind of fluctuated wildly and they seem to correspond with the inverse fluctuation in your Hotel revenue -- Hotel margins.","Have you done anything to change over the last couple of years, your attribution of marketing between those because obviously someone who comes into your site because coming in for multiple reasons. And so it's somewhat subjective what they're coming in for?","Ernst Teunissen","First part of your question is about that line of hotel revenue. Two main components auction and the other is Hotel B2B services which split between subscription services, as well as sponsor placement services. So Hotel B2B is the other component there. There is -- there has been no reallocation of expenses over the last years or marketing expenses between the segments. So that's not a driver.","The core -- there is no -- the correlation as you're identifying, I don't think is there. There have been very specific reasons why our E&D margins came down over the last year and now up again and we talked about that in significant investment cycle, we've had over the last two years specifically in our Experiences business and a shift from supply growth through demand growth now in the upcoming year.","Steve Kaufer","Yes, this is Steve. If you look back, we had wanted to diversify our business over the past five years. And with our acquisitions of LaFourchette and Viator the subsequent set of acquisitions and the investment that we put behind them at the expense of margin over the past several years, you can see that it paid off pretty much as we had looked for in terms of growing the overall E&D component. And so now, we're sitting here yes with the hotel auction that's challenged, but a growing hotel B2B business, a growing media business, a growing experiences business, a growing restaurant business, as we successfully with still lots more to come, but successfully moved the core focus of our overall business from Hotel auction to a much more diversified and growing set of segments.","Operator","Our next question -- I'm sorry. Our last question comes from James Lee with Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open.","James Lee","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Ernst, just want to follow-up on the contribution from acquisition for the restaurant reservation business. Is it fair to say that the additional contribution is in line pretty much with the growth of the restaurant supply that you added from the acquisitions here? And then also for Steve, I think over the last couple of quarters you've been speaking very highly of your newsfeed product. I was wondering, any new learnings there? Any new improvements or features you plan to add for 2020 to increase the engagement of travelers on your website? Thanks.","Ernst Teunissen","So, to your first question, that math is probably too simplistic that you have outlined. It is going to make a contribution. As I said, these assets stand-alone have been growth-challenged, but we can integrate them into our platform. It's going to be somewhat difficult going forward to fully tease apart how much the acquisitions have delivered and how much we've done with it as part of our overall platform. We see acceleration of growth in our overall E&D line. These acquisitions are going to help, but also other lines the organic growth lines, we see a very important opportunity as well.","Steve Kaufer","And this is Steve. The list is quite long in terms of additional product enhancements in 2020 to help drive engagement. We talked a lot already about members. We talked about a new app experience. We talked about better able to help the traveler plan out and save all the different things that they're looking to do and present that in a more convenient way and enable travelers to share that with their traveling companions, all in the engagement category to the feed question that we had launched. The feed is still there. Everything still gets posted. It helps in different types of content contribution. We like all that. It's just kind of one of the many things in 2020 that we expect will be helping to drive engagement.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to CEO, Steve Kaufer for any closing remarks.","Steve Kaufer","Terrific. Thanks everyone for joining the call with us today. In closing, we're executing on our plan and I look forward to updating everyone on our continued progress next quarter. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."]}}
