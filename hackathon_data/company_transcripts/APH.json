(Operator Instructions). I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Ms. Diana Reardon. Ma'am, you may begin.","Diana Reardon","Thank you. Good afternoon. My name is Diana Reardon and I am Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO and we would like to welcome you all to our third quarter earnings call, Q3 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question and answer session.","Please note that all the share and per share amounts that we'll discuss today have been adjusted to reflect the company's 2-for-1 stock split that was effective earlier this month. The company closed the third quarter with sales of $1.359 billion and EPS, excluding onetime items of $0.58, achieving strong growth and new records of performance in both sales and earnings per share. Sales were up 18% in US dollars and local currencies compared to Q3 of 2013. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency impacts, sales in the quarter were up 11%. ","Sequentially sales were up 3% in both US dollars and organically from Q2 of 2014, breaking down sales into our two major components. Our cable business, which comprised 7% of our sales, was flat with last year. The interconnect business, which comprised 93% of our sales, was up 19% from last year, reflecting the benefits of both good organic growth and the company's successful acquisition program. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.","Operating income, excluding onetime items increased to $270 million in the quarter. Operating margin excluding onetime items, increased to 19.9% compared to 19.7% last year and 19.5% last quarter. The sequential increase of 40 basis points in operating margins over the second quarter represents an excellent conversion margin on incremental sales of over 30%. This strong performance resulted from an increase in operating margins in the interconnect business based on excellent operating execution and cost management on incremental sales volume.","From a segment perspective, in the cable business margins were 12.5% down from 12.7% last quarter and 13.8% last year primarily due to the impact of market pricing and some impact from product mix. In the interconnect business, margins were 22.1%, up from 21.6% last quarter and 22% last year. We're very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement. We continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and culture of cost control are a significant contributor to the company's excellent operating performance, ensuring that the company's resources and cost structure are appropriately and quickly adjusted to maximize profitability in what continues to be a dynamic environment.","Through the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance. The company has recorded acquisition costs in both the current quarter and in last year's third quarter of approximately $2.5 million or $0.01 per share.","These costs include professional fees, transaction taxes and other expenses relating to the acquisitions closed in the respective quarters. In accordance with current accounting rules, these costs are expensed as incurred.","In addition at this point, we do anticipate approximately $6 million in onetime acquisition-related charges in the fourth quarter relating to the valuation of the acquired backlog of the Casco business as is required under U.S. GAAP. These onetime charges will be separately disclosed as is our practice and are not included in our guidance. Interest expense for the quarter was $21 million compared to $16 million last year due to higher average debt levels resulting from the company's acquisition and stock buyback programs. Other income was $4.7 million in the quarter, up from $3.6 million last year primarily as a result of higher interest income on higher levels of cash and short term cash investments.","The company's effective tax rate in the quarter was 26.5% compared to 25.5% last year both excluding onetime items. On an as reported basis, the company's effective tax rate was 26.8% this quarter and approximately 23.9% in last year's third quarter. The 2013 rate included the impact of a net benefit of $3.6 million relating primarily to the completion of prior-year audits.","Net income excluding onetime items was approximately 14% of sales in Q3 and EPS before onetime items increased 18% from last year, a very strong performance. Orders for the quarter were $1.342 billion up 17% from last year resulting in a book-to-bill ratio in the quarter of approximately 0.99 to 1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash and had strong cash flow in the quarter of $224 million or approximately 122% of net income. For the nine months, operating cash flow was $607 million or 117% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income.","The company had good working capital management during the quarter. Inventory was $848 million at the end of September, up 2% from June excluding the impact from the Casco acquisition which was closed at the end of the quarter. Inventory days also excluding the acquisition impact, were 80 days down one day from June levels. Accounts receivable was $1.1 billion at the end of September, up 3% from June, excluding acquisition impacts.","Days sales outstanding was 70 days and consistent with June levels, accounts payable was $600 million at the end of the quarter, up 8% from June levels excluding acquisition impacts and payable days were 56 days, up two days compared to June.","The cash flow from operations along with our net proceeds from our senior note offerings of $745 million, cash on hand of $192 million, $41 million in proceeds from stock option exercises were used to purchase 3 million shares of the company's stock during the quarter for $151 million to fund net capital expenditures of $57 million. We funded acquisition payments of $449 million in the quarter relating to the Casco acquisition and repaid $469 million under our revolving credit facility. We also made $71 million in dividend payments during the quarter.","At the end of the quarter, the company had 2.9 million shares remaining under its 20 million share stock repurchase program which expires in January of 2015. As previously announced in September, the company completed a $750 million note offering of three and seven-year notes. The notes were issued at 99.9% of their respective face values and have interest rates of 1.55% and 3 1\/8% respectively. The company incurred fees of approximately $5 million in connection with the sale. The notes were issued in anticipation of the company's upcoming debt maturity of its $600 million 4.75% notes, which are due in mid-November.","At the end of September, our cash and short term investments balance stood at $1.245 billion, the majority of which is held outside the U.S. Debt at the end of September was $2.6 billion, bringing net debt to $1.35 billion. At quarter-end, borrowings and availability under the company's $1.5 billion revolving credit facility were $22 million and $1.48 billion respectively and EBITDA in the quarter was $307 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter.","Before I turn the call over to Adam, I would like to make a few comments relative to the guidance. As noted in the press release, we have increased our 2014 guidance by $50 million in sales and $0.03 in earnings at the low end and $30 million in sales and $0.02 in earnings at the high end. The increase in guidance reflects the net positive impact of the addition of the Casco acquisition and a slight increase in organic sales which is partially offset by the translation impact of the significantly stronger dollar. The Casco acquisition that closed at the end of the quarter adds about $55 million in sales and $0.02 in earnings.","The negative translation impact caused by the significant strengthening of the dollar towards the end of Q3 in relation to the euro and certain other currencies has the impact of reducing 2014 sales guidance by just under $30 million in sales and a $0.01 in earnings per share. In addition, organic revenue is up about $5 million versus prior guidance with stronger operating execution adding about $0.01 of earnings in the second half versus our prior guidance with Q3 slightly up and Q4 slightly below the prior expectations. Our guidance for 2014 reflects a strong organic growth rate for the year of 7%.","I would also just note relative to the Q4 guidance that, from a sequential standpoint at the high end of guidance, sales are up 2% with the Casco acquisition increasing sales by 3% and the negative translation impact from the stronger dollar reducing sales by 1%. From an organic standpoint, Q4 sales are expected to be relatively flat which is down slightly from our prior guidance for Q4 but slightly better, as I mentioned, for the totality of the second half of 2014. The flat sequential organic performance in Q4 results primarily from an expected 18% or so decline sequentially in the mobile network market based on an expected pause in spending in this market in both China and North America after a somewhat stronger than expected Q3. The expected pause in spending in this market in the second half of 2014 is consistent with our prior expectations.","Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends.","Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much Diana and let me also add my welcome to all of you here on the phone today. I'm going to spend a few moments to highlight our achievements in the third quarter. As Diana mentioned, I will then discuss our trends and progress across our served markets and I will just make some short comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year. With respect to the third quarter, I can just tell you that we're very pleased to have reported new records in sales and EPS, both of which exceeded the high end of our prior guidance.","Sales increased 18% from prior year and 3% sequentially establishing a new record for the company of $1.359 billion in sales. As Diana mentioned, orders also reached a new record of $1.342 billion. We're very proud of our profitability in the quarter, which was very strong as we generated excellent sequential conversion margins leading to an expansion of our already industry-leading operating margin to 19.9%. And with our successful third quarter bond offering, we once again reaffirmed the financial strength of Amphenol.","I can just tell you that I'm extremely proud of our global team who once again in the third quarter was able to react quickly to the many opportunities that are being created by the electronics revolution while continuing to exercise the discipline and drive necessary to achieve outstanding operating performance. Our record results in this third quarter clearly demonstrate the benefits of Amphenol's entrepreneurial culture.","As we already announced early in the quarter, we're very pleased to have completed at the end of the quarter the previously announced acquisition of Casco Automotive Group which was completed at the very end of the third quarter. Casco is a global manufacturer of highly engineered, data connectivity, power charging and sensor products to the worldwide automotive market with annual sales of approximately $220 million, a very significant acquisition for us and really one of the three largest that we've made in our history.","Importantly, Casco represents a significant new platform for future expansion for the company; in particular as we now have a leading position in automobile in-cabin data and power interconnect as well as an expanded range of sensor products. We are very excited to welcome the outstanding Casco team to Amphenol and we look forward to continuing to create value in the future with our very successful acquisition program.","Now turning to the trends in our served markets, I just want to mention that once again, we're very pleased that our balanced and broad end-market diversification supported very clearly the company's strong performance in the third quarter. We're particularly pleased that no single market represented more than 17% of our total sales in the quarter, a great confirmation of the balance across markets that we participate in.","Now turning to the individual markets, the military market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased 7% from prior year and 3% from prior quarter on stronger sales of products into military aircraft engine, communications, ordinance and avionics. We're especially encouraged that after essentially six quarters of year-over-year declines in the military market in the third quarter. We were able to deliver strong performance despite continuing downward pressure on overall military budgets.","Looking towards the fourth quarter, we expect demand to continue to grow somewhat from these levels on increased volumes of new programs on which we have higher content. While military budgets overall are clearly not expanding, our technology leadership and broad program participation has enabled us to realize the growth that we experienced in the third quarter and has allowed us to benefit long term from the expanding adoption of electronics and military hardware as well as from stronger spending trends that we see in emerging geographies.","The commercial aerospace market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter, sales increased a strong 16% from prior year and declined seasonally as we had expected by roughly 6%. Our year-over-year growth was driven by benefits from last year's Ionix acquisition together with our increasing content on new programs which continue to ramp towards volume production. For the fourth quarter, we expect demand to essentially remain at these levels and we retain a positive outlook for the commercial air market in 2014 and beyond.","We're very pleased that we're now realizing the benefits from our long standing efforts to gain position on the latest generation of airliners. As airlines continue to demand planes that are more fuel efficient and that create a better flying experience for the traveling public, aircraft manufacturers are adopting complex, new technologies on their next-generation airliners. This is creating an exciting, long-term opportunity for Amphenol.","The industrial market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. We once again achieved extremely strong sales growth in the industrial market of 44%, driven by contributions from the Advanced Sensors acquisition completed at the end of last year, as well as by a very robust 18% organic growth in the industrial market. In fact, sales increased 3% sequentially in a quarter that would normally be seasonally softer.","Our excellent organic growth was driven by strength in the medical, rail mass transit and oil and gas segments in particular which again is a clear confirmation of the value of our diversification strategy across the industrial market. Looking towards the fourth quarter, we expect our sales to remain at these high levels and we look forward to continued progress as we broaden our interconnect and sensor technology offering while increasing our penetration of the many exciting growth areas of the industrial market. The automotive market represented 15% of our sales in the quarter.","Sales increased significantly from prior year, growing also by 44% and a very strong 21% organically. As we continue to benefit from the diverse range of new sensor and infotainment automotive products provided by our acquisitions last fourth quarter of Advanced Sensors and Tecvox and as we continue to grow our sales of new products (indiscernible) and emissions management, as well as drivetrain control among other applications.","Our sales in the market grew by 3% sequentially even with the impact of a typical third quarter seasonality. We're very proud that we're outgrowing the overall automotive electronics market and really by a wide margin as we're capitalizing on our broadened suite of interconnect and sensor technologies which are being incorporated into a wide array of new and complex vehicle electronics.","Now with the addition of Casco, we have further expanded our product offering and are positioned in several new high growth applications within the car, including data and power connectivity as well as temperature, sun and rain sensors. Casco also strengthens our position with a diverse set of highly complementary vehicle manufacturers, thereby bolstering our overall position in the automotive, interconnect and sensor market.","Looking towards the fourth quarter, we expect a significant increase from these sales levels as we benefit from the contributions of Casco and we look forward to an overall excellent 2014 and beyond for our rapidly expanding automotive business. The mobile devices market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased as we had expected by a robust 13% from prior year and 14% sequentially, driven by higher demand essentially across all mobile device product types.","Once again, our mobile device team was able to quickly flex our production resources to capitalize on increased volume requirements from our customers demonstrating that our organizational agility remains a core advantage of Amphenol in this very dynamic end market.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect sales to grow further from these levels as we benefit from a range of new program launches. We remain confident that, despite the ever-changing landscape in the mobile device market, our leading technology, our preferred supplier relationships with the broadest range of device makers as well as most importantly the excellent execution of our outstanding agile organization positions us well for the future in this exciting market.","The mobile networks market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter and we continue to support significantly higher levels of demand for wireless network build outs in the quarter with sales increasing a stronger than expected 38% from prior year. This was driven by growth in both OEM and service provider sales essentially across all major geographies. While we had anticipated some sequential slowdown in sales going into the third quarter, our sales actually grew slightly from the second quarter.","Consistent with our prior expectations of a somewhat lower second half compared to the first half and as Diana mentioned earlier we now expect a roughly 18% sequential reduction of sales in the fourth quarter as operators around the world are planning a moderation of their recently strong build out activities. Regardless of this end-of-the-year pause in activity levels, we're very pleased with our overall performance in the mobile networks market in the full year of 2014 and we remain extremely confident that with our industry-leading breadth of interconnect as well as antenna products. We will continue to participate broadly in ongoing next generation mobile network deployment around the world. We look forward to further building on this excellent platform in the long term.","The information technology and data communications market represented 16% of our sales in the quarter, as we had expected, sales decreased by 6% from prior year due to lower levels of sales of products that are incorporated in particular into networking equipment. Sequentially, our sales increased slightly from the second quarter as stronger growth in storage and servers was almost all offset by lower sales of networking related products.","Given the continued uncertainties in the IP datacom market in particular related to networking equipment, we do expect a slight moderation of sales in the fourth quarter and we continue to anticipate sales to be slightly down for the full year in this market consistent with our prior guidance. While there are no doubt a great deal of changes occurring in the IT datacom world, we remain encouraged by our industry-leading high speed and power products. Our preferred relationships with leading equipment suppliers, as well as our enhanced focus on service provider and data center customers all of which are creating a platform for us to outperform in the future in this important market.","The broadband market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter and sales declined slightly from prior year on a moderation of spending from U.S., cable operators and were essentially flat to the second quarter.","Looking out towards the fourth quarter, we expect a slight reduction in demand which is due to normal year-end seasonality in this space. Although the demand and pricing environment for traditional bulk cable continues to be challenging, we are seeing still the emerging benefits of our product and customer diversification and ultimately. Our future success in this market rests on the company's proven capability to create innovative solutions for our customers to support the rapid growth in high speed data delivery. As we drive further efforts to create these enabling technologies. We look forward to maintaining our leading position in the broadband market.","So in summary, with respect to the third quarter, I can just tell you very simply put I'm extremely proud of the Amphenol organization as once again we executed so well in a challenging and dynamic market environment. Our performance in 2014 so far has been a clear reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across our diverse array of markets, our worldwide presence and our lean and flexible cost structure. But above all these strengths, our greatest asset remains, our high performance culture that is reinforced every single day by Amphenol's agile and entrepreneurial management team.","Now turning to the outlook and Diana has already spoken at length about this, but let me just say that based on stable economic conditions as well as on constant exchange rates including the impact of the relatively weaker overseas currencies that we now see -- we now expect in the fourth quarter and the full year 2014 the following results.","We expect sales in the range of $1.341 billion to $1.381 billion in the fourth quarter and $5.260 billion to $5.3 billion for the full year respectively and we expect EPS for the fourth quarter and full year in the range of $0.58 to $0.60 and $2.20 to $2.22 respectively. For the full year, this represents both sales and EPS growth excluding onetime items of a very strong 14% to 15%.","We\u2019re very encouraged by our continued strong outlook in sales and earnings, especially given the many uncertainties that are clearly present in the global marketplace. The ongoing revolution in electronics is continuing to create tremendous opportunities for Amphenol and I am confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to continue to capitalize on these opportunities both to grow our market position and to expand our profitability and thereby to drive continued superior performance for Amphenol.","Thank you very much and at this time operator we would be happy to take any questions that there may be.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Two questions for me. Maybe to start with Adam, in the press release, you talked about seeing some increased level of uncertainty on a geopolitical basis. I'm actually struggling to understand where in your guide are you factoring this in, other than the mobile networks, which I realize is down a fair amount. But if I look at all the other segments, kind of flat to up a little almost. Can you maybe just talk about where are you seeing these uncertainties? Where do you see a downtick from order pattern across these end markets?","Adam Norwitt","First of all, let me say that the level of uncertainty in the marketplace -- we\u2019re not seeing anything different than anybody else is seeing in the newspaper. You read anything and there is certainly a more complex array of incidences and circumstances around the market and I think that's reflected in some of the movements you see in things like exchange rates and interest rates that clearly have moved more significantly in the quarter than anybody would have anticipated three months ago. Look, we give a range for our guidance and we always do that. But, as you know we certainly always strive to get to the top end of that range and that's certainly the goals that we have within the company.","But to the extent that we show a range, one could anticipate that if there were greater accelerating problems, that's why we have a low end of such a range and I think it's not necessarily that we're seeing specific things coming from customers but rather that there just appears to be as indicated by some of these movements a greater level of uncertainty around the world and that is whether it is political whether that is economic or whatever that is you see a flight to quality as evidenced in particular by the strength of the dollar and the interest rates today.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","And then just on the mobile devices, you obviously had a nice Q3, but how do we think about the growth in Q4? Because I was looking at the last five years and it's gone from as good as plus 30% to as bad as 20%. I know you said you expect growth, but is there a way to think about what do you think seasonal growth is? Is it low teens again in December and is it more tablet centric or more broad based this time around?","Adam Norwitt","Let me just put this in some perspective. We had excellent performance here in the third quarter, growing 13% year-over-year, 14% sequentially and as I mentioned we expect that to be somewhat higher in the fourth quarter. I think we would expect that kind of (indiscernible) high single-digits sequentially. If you put that in perspective compared to last year, in the second half this year, our growth is essentially going to be somewhere around the low 20% growth second half to first half and that's essentially what we saw also last year.","And you may also recall that last year in the fourth quarter, we had a very significant uptick in demand, which was essentially us picking up market share when others could not support the demands of certain new program ramps for customers. So we actually think that our performance this year in mobile devices is very consistent with prior years and very consistent with what we see in the marketplace where you have clearly a wide array of different results and expectations among customers, but our strong growth here across all the product lines that we're participating in. Again to grow by more than 20% second half to first half and to grow in the third quarter by 13% is we think not only consistent, but a very strong reflection of our excellent position in that mobile devices market.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research. You may ask your question.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Just backing up on some of the acquisitions that you've done this year Adam, I was curious, especially around the GE business and some of the momentum you're seeing in auto, could you talk about how you've been able to leverage the acquisition into those end markets, how it's translating into organic sales growth now? And then what those deals are doing in terms of adding to earnings for the full year? And then I had a follow-up. Thanks.","Adam Norwitt","Well, I will talk a little bit about the leverage and then I will let Diana comment to some extent on how those are contributing. But let me just say that we're so happy with the Advanced Sensors acquisition and I think that's the one you mentioned. Obviously, we did five acquisitions last year, four of them completed in the fourth quarter that included Advanced Sensors and Tecvox to name two and we're just very, very pleased in particular with Advanced Sensors.","As we've talked about from the day that that company joined Amphenol, it's a fabulous company from numerous respects. Number one, great technology and I think now as we're coming upon soon the first year anniversary of that company joining Amphenol, we feel even stronger about the value of the technology of the company across the range of sensors that they supply because it is a very diversified company. I think the second thing that we talked a lot about was the fact that it is a very diversified company, about 2\/3rds of the sales in industrial and 1\/3rd in automotive, but within those markets has a very, very diversified array of applications and then customers from medical, heavy equipment to advanced smart building, Internet of Things type applications and then within the car from pressure and temperature, CO2 and all of those type of sensing applications. And all that I can tell you is, again, our great expectations have been really surpassed in terms of the depth that that brings us with the customers.","I myself have been to a number of these customers over the course of the year and in each time I go to those customers, you hear a very common refrain and that is that the challenges that the customers are experiencing relative to sensors very frequently revolve around the mechanical interface of the connector and how to integrate that sensor into the interconnect system that then allows that to perform its desired functionality. Again, that was our theory going into it, more than a theory actually that we felt was true, but that has been truly confirmed as we go on.","Now let me say things don't happen overnight. Rome was clearly not built in a day in terms of leveraging the typical things that people talk about, synergies and all of that, but we are getting leverage. We're getting leverage at customers who now see us as a broader supplier. We're getting penetration at customers with whom we previously had maybe a smaller presence and today, now we're viewed as a more broad strategic partnership where our access to decision-makers in those customers is greater than it was before and conversely, the Advanced Sensors business gets viewed now under -- in the kind of patina of an Amphenol who is known as a powerful and leading component supplier as opposed to sort of a company within a big conglomerate like a GE that really was viewed as an adjunct to their core business. And I think all of that together has acted to create really a truly fabulous first year and the honeymoon has certainly not ended yet for us in Advanced Sensors.","Diana Reardon","And Steven, in terms of the impact of the acquisitions on a year-over-year basis, if we look at the high end of guidance, our sales growth is expected to be about 15%. About 8% or so is the contribution from the acquisition program on the top line and I would say it's a little bit less than that from a bottom-line perspective, but certainly a very strong contribution all the way around from the program in 2014.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Then just a quick follow-up. In terms of two of the markets, auto and industrial, and I think you touched on this a little bit in just what you talked about, Adam, but those two markets seem to be drawing more attention relative to some of the geopolitical concerns in Europe. Can you just give us a base case for how you see those markets right now and whether you're more concerned about end demand or how maybe you're able to overcome it a little bit more given some of these acquisitions? Thanks a lot.","Adam Norwitt","Again, thank you very much. I think relative to Europe, clearly, I've been in Europe a couple times in the last month and you don't want to read the paper if you want to have a smile on your face. But I can tell you that our team has executed fabulously in Europe and in fact, if I look at our performance by region, truly in local currency and organically, however you want to look at it, Europe was actually our fastest-growing region in the quarter on a year-over-year basis.","So clearly, the Amphenol team is not putting their head in the sand after reading every morning the Financial Times or Le Monde or Der Spiegel or whatever that is going to be. So I think from that standpoint, we are doing outstanding in that space compared to what the overall macro is performing. And I think there's no doubt about it; our strength in industrial and automotive, as well as in commercial air, which is another space where we do have more business in Europe and mobile infrastructure, our teams there have just done an outstanding job at executing on the opportunities at hand and then refocusing the resources towards those places where there is growth opportunity because regardless of what happens in the macro environment, the electronics revolution is continuing without missing a beat. You've just got to find where that is and I think our ongoing strategy of diversification, in particular in the industrial market, the automotive market, I mean these are areas where we're constantly plumbing for new places where technology is taking hold and not trying to take share from others, but trying to enable something that is new. And I think that has been really the recipe that we have followed. In Europe, we follow it obviously on a global basis, but I think the impact of it compared to the macro indicators is certainly magnified in Europe to the positive for Amphenol.","Operator","Your next question comes from James Kisner with Jefferies. Please ask your question.","James Kisner - Jefferies","I'm just wondering again about mobile devices. Obviously, there was some very strong demand at some large OEMs recently and perhaps even a surprise in mix shift towards larger phones at one major OEM. I'm just wondering if you could comment on leadtime or supply chain dynamics, mobile devices. Is there any potential for double ordering, tightness in supply chain and perhaps also what are the key puts and takes that we might think about entering into Q1 seasonality? Thanks.","Adam Norwitt","Sure. Let me answer the last part, which is it's too early to say about Q1. I think we're not in a position yet, especially in a market like mobile devices, where visibility is not necessarily the longest in that space. I can't tell you that we have seen ourselves any double ordering or tightening of supply chain. Obviously, we're making certain products, antennas and interconnect products and we certainly ourselves don't have any tightening of our supply chains and we are more than able to satisfy very quickly our customers. And that has been a real hallmark and a benchmark of Amphenol for a long time.","Again, I mentioned earlier in the call, last year in the fourth quarter when we had sort of a real unexpected uptick in demand and we were able to do that really flawlessly when our competitors were not. So I think from that standpoint, we are not stretching leadtimes. We are not a bottleneck and to the extent that customers can take more, we will be there to support them with that. Otherwise, what other components are doing relative to that, I can't tell you that I have great visibility on it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS.","Amitabh Passi - UBS","Diana, my first question was for you. I was curious how are you thinking about OpEx into the calendar fourth quarter, particularly now with the integration of Casco?","Diana Reardon","Sure. I think that you probably saw in the financials in Q3 that we had a good performance in terms of operating costs or SG&A in Q3 and they've now come kind of back down to the level they were at last year at that time. We had some increase in the first quarter when the Advanced Sensors acquisition came in as they were running at a higher level, but I think they've started to manage some of those expenses down. I think as we look into Q4, I would expect kind of a normal Amphenol pattern where we would see less SG&A growth from a percentage standpoint than we would see in sales growth. And I think that the Casco acquisition has a cost structure that I would say more mirrors our own, so I wouldn't expect any significant impact there.","Amitabh Passi - UBS","Okay. And it seems like the last couple of quarters you've had an attractive conversion margin of greater than 30%. I'm just wondering do you think that's sustainable over the next couple of quarters, particularly as you continue to integrate and optimize the sensors business or do you think you revert back towards the mid-20%s target? I'm just trying to get some rough sense of how we think about what you're seeing in conversion margins, which has been quite attractive the last couple of quarters.","Diana Reardon","Sure. I guess I would say two things. One is our long-term goal is still 25% and to your point, we have been doing better than that the last couple of quarters. There have been a number of factors contributing to that. Certainly very good operating execution across the company. I think in this quarter, we'll also start to see some impact as the acquisitions come closer to the average of the company, so we have a lot of good strong contributions going on there. I think that when you look at Q4, the sales volume, as I said when I walked through the guidance in the prepared remarks, the incremental sequential sales growth is really coming from the Casco acquisition with some offset from the foreign currency translation. So as we look there, we wouldn't expect, because of the components of the sales change, for that to be at that high conversion margin level. We would expect more ROS in Q4 to probably be closer to that Q3 level."," And as we look into next year and give guidance for next year when we close the fourth quarter, I think we will talk more about what to expect at that point. But I think I can tell you that our 25% conversion margin goal certainly still remains the goal for the management team.","Operator","Your next question comes from Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Please ask your question.","Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research","The first just being on mobile networks, it looks that the absolute dollar level of sales for this year is probably in line with maybe where you previously guided. It's just the shape of the back half is different. Is that true? And second, within that is it just a pause in spending? Did you see was it more of a pull-ahead, and does this in any way impact your view on 2015 and what could be another good year for the mobile networks business in 2015?","Adam Norwitt","I think you correctly characterize if we think about how we had guided to the mobile infrastructure market going forward, we had said that we would expect the market to be somewhat down in the second half compared to the first half. Our Q3 sales were a little bit higher than expected, and thus I think the fourth quarter is maybe a little bit more of a drop-off than we would have expected coming from the third quarter.","But if you look at it, first half to second half based on our outlook, it would be down 1% or 2% in the second half to the first half, which I think on any industry comparable basis is a very, very strong performance. And when we think about the performance this year, we expect still to be up in that market and kind of the mid-20% range. Again, very, very strong performance and much stronger than you see in kind of the OEM reports that are available and I think it compares very favorably on any peer basis.","What does that mean, the fourth quarter relative to looking out into next year? We have not given guidance about next year, but I don't think that our change in guidance here would change any degree our outlook long term in the market. We have an outstanding position. I think one thing that has been very favorable for us this year has been that regardless of what spending happens, we have demonstrated this year to our customers that when they need us, we are there for them. With very strong upticks in demand -- you may recall in the second quarter, we had just an outstanding second-quarter sequential growth, somewhere close to I believe 20% quarter-to-quarter and to react so quickly as we were able to do when our customers needed it, that is something that they don't forget going forward.","In particular in this market where oftentimes you're not talking about factories, you're talking really about crews in the field waiting for parts. And you don't want to be the guy who is holding those crews up in the field waiting for parts and we have never been and in fact, we've just executed so well in that strong growth this year that whatever happens in the overall spending market, I think our position and our ability to capture more than our fair share of that going forward has been very much confirmed this year and will create a great platform for us in the future.","Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research","Okay and then a brief follow-up. It's not part shortages holding anything up right now and then just on Casco, that $0.02 of accretion for the fourth quarter, should we expect that to normalize to maybe like a $0.03 plus range as we head into 2015 per quarter?","Adam Norwitt","I'll answer about -- there was not a parts shortage, if that's what you're asking relative to mobile devices. There's no impact. It's just in the quarter we see somewhat less buildout activity and I'll let Diana talk about Casco.","Diana Reardon","Sure. I think that the $0.02 in the fourth quarter is within a margin of what we would expect to see in 2015. I think we're not giving guidance for next year yet and we don't ordinarily specifically call out EPS contribution from individual acquisitions. I did it in this case; I thought it would be helpful because we had a lot of moving parts in the guidance. But I don't think the $0.02 would be misrepresentative of the level that we would see next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please ask your question.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","I think that you, or maybe, Adam, you said that growth in the fourth quarter on an organic basis is probably about flat. I wanted to understand if that is more sort of a timing issue. I think you said for the full year you expect to grow revenue about 7% on an organic basis, but wanted to think about your views of organic growth going forward and if you still think you can grow 2X the market?","Diana Reardon","Sure. Maybe just to say the numbers and then maybe Adam can talk about the growth versus the market, but that flat organic growth I was talking about was the sequential performance between Q3 and Q4. If we look at, on a year-over-year basis, which is what the 7% for the full-year is year-over-year, in the fourth quarter from an organic standpoint is somewhere in the sort of the 3% range and it is somewhat impacted by the fact that while the mobile device market is growing sequentially between Q3 and Q4 on a year-over-year basis, we did have a huge fourth quarter in 2013 for the reasons that Adam already described and so that does have some impact in terms of the year-over-year organic growth discreetly in the fourth quarter.","Adam Norwitt","And Sherri, relative to our target and history, long history of outperforming the market and really growing at 2 times the market, we continue to have a great degree of conviction around our ability to do that and we believe not only do we have the ability, but we've really built the platform to do that going forward. Ultimately what is the market growing, that we'll only be able to assess when the dust has settled on 2014. But I think this year our performance is really outstanding given this guidance that we have and we continue to look forward to pursuing and achieving on that 2 times the market goal going forward.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","And then, Diana, you gave some detail on the impact of the stronger dollar relative to foreign currencies in the fourth quarter and just wanted to understand how much will that continue into 2015 and is it sort of the same magnitude as the fourth quarter? Thanks.","Diana Reardon","Sure. When we would look at 2015, if rates stay roughly where they are, we would expect it could be something like a 1% year-over-year drag from a translation perspective if that helps.","Operator","Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. Please ask your question.","William Stein - SunTrust","One question and one follow-up, first, I want to just ask a follow-up on the wireless infrastructure business. There has been pretty widespread understanding that there have been some component shortages, not from Amphenol, but in the RF power amp area that have caused some other companies to have kind of inconsistent results in this market. So I'm wondering if you see this as more of a pause in buildout by the carriers or is this an inventory adjustment by the equipment vendors and then I had a balance sheet question as well.","Adam Norwitt","It's very true. I think in the first half of the year, there were these component shortages and you correctly point out I mean what we hear also related to RF power amps in particular. I don't know whether there were others, but the RF power amp was certainly something that was widely discussed in the industry. And I think we talked about last quarter and even before that, because of that, we probably would have anticipated this year the second half to be even more down compared to the first half. But they were not able, many of our customers, to truly get the build rates of the base stations up because they didn't have these -- they were missing these components.","And I think, from that perspective, that's one of the factors that allows -- in our second half, we're down only really by about 1% or 1.5% compared to the first half. Otherwise that could have been a more significant falloff in demand as there really was quite a wave of buildout happening that was intended at least to happen in the first half. None of those -- I have not heard recently that those component shortages are continuing. I think there's a relatively normal degree of demand. Whether there was double ordering of those components or whatnot, I mean we're not close enough to really judge.","Now one thing to understand is we're shipping -- some portion of our business in mobile infrastructure goes to OEMs, but another portion and really a roughly equal size goes direct to service providers. And so when we're selling to service providers, you don't really have inventory corrections per se. That's much more in a real, almost just-in-time delivery where they say we're going to have a crew there in a week and we need your parts there also on that same week. And from that standpoint, you don't get those inventory bubbles that you can get more related to a traditional OEM manufacturing process.","William Stein - SunTrust","And the follow-up, maybe, Diana, for you, capital expenditures as a percent of revenue has been a bit elevated and it was again this quarter and I'm wondering if that's related to Sidney. I thought that that had been already kind of resolved and built out. Maybe there's something else going on. Thank you.","Diana Reardon","Sure. Actually you're correct; it has been higher for the last few quarters. And in this third quarter, there was the last of the spending relating to the project that you mentioned where we were building a new facility to replace the flood-damaged one from a couple years back. So we have been spending more at 4% of sales over the last few quarters in order to accommodate that additional spending. We would expect the spending to come down in the fourth quarter to a more normal level and would expect the same as we move into 2015 and that normal level would be somewhere in the 3%, 3.5% of sales range.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Please ask your question.","Jim Suva - Citi","Adam and Diana, to you and your team there at Amphenol. When we look at your recent acquisitions, I think it's fair to say they're kind of going as an extension, so to speak, beyond your traditional cable and connector business when we start talking about sensors and all this. And then when we did some work looking at the industry of sensors, it actually looks like sensors are more profitable than traditional connectors. So is it fair to say that there is a chance that these recent acquisitions could actually be accretive to your companywide margins and if not, maybe is there something wrong with my logic or what I see in the sensor industry versus connectors?","Adam Norwitt","I think it's very true. I mean we have been, over the last essentially three years, we've now made 11 acquisitions and of those, two of them have a sensor component. One was the Advanced Sensors business that we acquired close to a year ago, which was exclusively sensors and then we acquired here Casco, which has a sensor productline, as well as their interconnect productline.","I think the sensor market is for us one that we feel very good about because of its wonderful leverage that you can get between the sensor and the interconnect product, combined with its great diversification. Much as we love so much the diversification of the interconnect market, we feel the same way about the diversification within the sensor market.","Now are sensors by definition more profitable than connectors? I wouldn't necessarily say that. I think there have been examples in the sensor industry of some who make more money and some who make less. I think when we acquired the Advanced Sensors business, we did talk about the fact that, at the time we acquired it, that company was operating at a level that was meaningfully below our corporate average and that we certainly had the aspiration and the goal to bring it up to our corporate average over time.","Is there something empirically different about sensors that means you can make more money than connectors? I don't know that that is true, but I do know that there's certainly at least the equal opportunity to make great returns in the sensor market because, at the end of the day, we're able to make our fabulous returns into the interconnect market by enabling the technologies of our customers, by creating for them something that ultimately makes their system perform better, either have a better performance, be able to sell more of them, get a better marketshare, whatever they can do with their end equipment."," And I think sensors have very much the same property to them. You embed technology in the sensors and that is either with the sensing element or very interestingly you embed the technology in the packaging of the interconnect. And by embedding that technology, which creates value for the end customer, you're thereby able to charge a price that allows you to make a fair return on that business. And so to that standpoint, we certainly feel that the sensor market has at least as good of an opportunity to make the returns that we like to make and we'll see over time whether it's better than we think.","Jim Suva - Citi","And a quick follow-up for Diana. Diana, for currency changes, is it mostly like the euro or the yen or what particular denomination should we be most mindful of because someday down the road, I'm sure currencies will change a little bit again?","Diana Reardon","Sure. The euro would be the biggest one that would have an impact on us. Others have some impact as well, but they are smaller.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Wood with Macquarie. Please ask your question.","Mike Wood - Macquarie","In terms of going back to automotive. 21% organic growth is very impressive and significant outgrowth. You've called out some synergies from Advanced Sensors. My understanding of the automotive business, there's typically very long leadtimes to get on programs before you actually get those synergies. Can you talk about how you're getting them so quickly and with Casco, would that be the similar type of immediate synergies?","Adam Norwitt","Thank you very much. I think, again, we're very pleased with this 21% organic growth. I don't think I attributed that growth necessarily to these so-called synergies between the sensors and the connectors. Even if we have actually started to see some early opportunities a little bit even quicker than we expected them to leverage a connector in a sense or in a single application, but clearly that's not the main driver or even a significant driver of the 21% growth.","The 21% growth is really coming from new applications in the car and when we look at these applications -- again, I mentioned a few -- emissions, telematics, drivetrain control, things like antilock braking. Essentially where ever you see in a car new electronic functionality that maybe was not there in the past, those are the type of systems that are really creating this outsized growth for us.","So again, this is not us just capturing a marketshare from an incumbent on something that is there already; it is us working long term, and this is over many, many years of effort to work to design in on new applications, as you correctly point out, over a relatively long cycle time and you see those new programs and those new functionalities and those new feature sets in the car starting to roll out. And I think the one thing that I would say is that the automakers around the world, they have clearly woken up to the fact that electronics helps them make money, number one and sell more cars, number two. And so I think that cycle of implementation of electronics into cars -- if anything, that cycle is compressing to a shorter cycle than the traditional sort of platform cycles that you see in the automotive industry. You have really what I would almost call mid-platform upgrades that happen on things like lighting systems and infotainment systems and otherwise, new things like LEDs in the car and all of that. I think these are all the areas where our team is heavily focused both in the short and the long term to make sure that we're participating at more than our fair share of those applications.","Mike Wood - Macquarie","Great. And just to be thorough, the only area I don't think we discussed is just the decline recently into metals like silver and gold to a lesser extent. Can you comment on what you'd expect to happen on the pricing erosion side going forward?","Diana Reardon","From a pricing erosion standpoint, I think that we put the guidance together based on the costs that we see at the particular time. I think as we've talked before, we do certainly a great job from an operating management standpoint to maximize overall profitability in the company and that's the combination of managing sales price and then managing cost and from a cost perspective, the current environment is certainly better relative to the trends in commodities than what we've seen in a few of the prior years, but we certainly wouldn't expect any particular windfall from any specific metal. The company uses a lot of different metals, a lot of different plastics and I think does a very good job of really getting the most bang for the buck from a profitability perspective. And I think you've seen two really strong quarters of excellent conversion margin here during 2014. We hit 19.9% ROS in the quarter and so we're really very pleased with the profitability performance of the company and the team is very committed as we look out into the future to continuing to work towards a 25% conversion margin goal and certainly good procurement practices is part of that, but there are many different factors that go into achieving that kind of profitability at the end of the day.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs","I was hoping you could help me understand the reason for the softness in the networking portion of your IT segment and then how we should think about that as we go into 2015.","Adam Norwitt","Thank you very much. I think -- I talked about the fact that in the IT datacom market, there is clearly a lot of dislocation happening and change happening in that market. And I'm sure you know as well as I do some of the macro factors that are happening there, the rise of data centers and web service providers, the challenges that many companies are facing in other markets, including places, for example, like China where, for a wide range of call them political considerations, certain legacy suppliers are having more trouble to sell in particular their core networking equipment into those spaces. And so for whatever reason it is, I think there has clearly been some moderation of the sales of these networking equipment.","But, look, at the end of the day, that is not going to be a perpetual situation because those are the equipment, this networking equipment and the IT, which is really forming the backbone of the Internet and the data rates that are going, that we see, the expansion of data rates that we see in our server and our storage business and that we see in particular with these new LTE and 3G networks that are being built up over the course of -- in the wireless market, these things are creating tremendous end demand for data that ultimately is going to flow through these core networks and through the switches and the routers and all of those things that drive the core networks. And ultimately will create let me just call it more of a pent-up demand for that equipment.","It actually reminds me somewhat of -- for a number of years, we saw, in the mobile infrastructure market, not great spending trends and over that time, there was that pent-up demand that grew and grew and ultimately developed into real demand. And whether that will happen in networking equipment and whether there will be that kind of real demand that comes as a result of this pent-up demand, that I can't tell you and I can't certainly predict what is the timing of that. But I think the empirical requirements of data on the network, those are not changing.","And now it relates to us, and if I look at our position and our position really on a global basis with customers who are creating that next-generation networking equipment, we have a position that is truly second to none. And that starts with our high-speed products and those high-speed products, which are really enabling the highest level of data transport through these systems. It goes to our power products. It goes to our fiber optics and others and the real broad suite of products that we supply into high-end IT datacom, no doubt about it, even if there is that kind of pause this year in that -- due to the changes that are happening in that market, our position long term with our high technology products is really second to none.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs","I appreciate the context there. For a follow-up question, I'm hoping you can help me think about the capital allocation strategy going forward. This year, the company has done some larger acquisitions in GE, Advanced Sensors, in Casco. You also stepped up the buyback a little bit this quarter and did the nice job buying back 3 million shares. Should we expect going forward that the company is planning to be a little bit more aggressive on the capital allocation strategy there in terms of the size of the potential companies you may tuck in or the way you're thinking about doing the buyback or is this just you had a couple of larger deals that came to fruition as you executed upon those?","Diana Reardon","Look, I think the company has had a very consistent strategy for many years relative to the deployment of the financial strength and the prioritization there clearly is towards the acquisition program, which we believe provides the company with the best long-term return both from a growth and profitability perspective. We do also though feel that a balance is important and I think whether or not you look at the last five years, you look at this year, you look at last year, I think what you see is really quite some balance if you would look at the free cash flow of the company with about half going back to shareholders in various forms and the other half being deployed towards the acquisition program.","I think as Adam has said on many occasions, the size of the acquisitions is not really the important criteria as far as we're concerned; it's much more about the fit from a technology standpoint, about the strength of the management team, about the potential that we see for both top and bottom-line growth. So we would certainly, if there was an appropriate acquisition that fit all of those criteria that was bigger, that would be something that we would prioritize that financial strength towards because, as I said before, we do feel as a management team that that's what makes the most sense for the company.","So I think what you'll see us continue to do as we look into the future is to continue to have a balanced approach, but certainly to err on the side of funding the acquisition program as those opportunities present themselves.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the speakers.","Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much and I'd like to thank all of you for spending some time with us today on what is here in New England a blustery fall day and we certainly appreciate all of your attention and I hope it's not too early as we will not speak to you until next year to wish all of you a great holiday season and a successful fourth quarter.

Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. ","Craig Lampo","Great. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2019 conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary and then Adam will give an overview of the business, as well as current trends, then we will take questions.","As a reminder, we may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information.","The company closed the fourth quarter with sales of $2.151 billion and with GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.03 and $0.98 respectively. Sales were down 3% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.","From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency impacts, sales in the fourth quarter decreased 8%. Sequentially, sales were up 2% in both U.S. dollars and in local currencies and up 1% organically.","Breaking sales down into our two segments, the Interconnect business, which comprise 95% of our sales, was down 3% in both U.S. dollars and in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of last year.","Our Cable business, which comprised the remainder of our sales, was down 3% in U.S. dollars and down 1% in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of last year.","For the full year 2019, sales were a record $8.225 billion, which was flat in U.S. dollars, up 2% in local currencies and down 3% organically compared to 2018. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.","Adjusted operating income was $430 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 20%, which compared to 21% in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 19.7% in the third quarter of 2019.","From a segment standpoint, in the interconnect segment, margins were 22% in the fourth quarter of 2019, which was down compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 at 22.8%.","This reduction was primarily driven by normal downside conversion on the organic decline in sales, as well as the impact of acquisitions, which are currently operating at profitability levels before the company -- below the company average.","In the cable segment, margins were 10%, which was down compared to 11.9% in the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily driven by volume and product mix. For the full year 2019, adjusted operating income was $1.645 billion, down 3% from 2018. We continue to be very proud of the company's operating margin achievement, which reached 20% for the full year 2019, especially given the demand environment.","This performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high performance action-oriented culture, in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in any market environment.","Through the careful fostering of this culture and the deployment of our strategies to both existing and acquired companies, our management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance in the future.","Interest expense for the quarter was $28 million compares to $26 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The company's adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5% for the fourth quarter 2019, compared to 25.5% in the fourth quarter of 2018.","The fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate for both periods excludes the impact of the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises. In the fourth quarter of 2018, adjusted effective tax rate also excludes the tax effect of acquisition-related costs as well as the finalization of the provisional income tax charge related to the Tax Act. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 was approximately 20.3%, compared to 21% in the fourth quarter of 2018.","For the full year, the company's adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5% compared to 25.5% in 2018. The adjusted effective tax rate excludes the impact of the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises, as well as the tax effect of both acquisition-related costs and refinancing related costs associated with the debt tender offer in the third quarter of 2019.","Full year 2018 adjusted effective tax rate also excludes the finalization of the provisional income tax charge related to the Tax Act. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for 2019 was 22.2% compared to 23.4% in 2018.","Adjusted net income was a strong 14% of sales for both the fourth quarter and full year 2019. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS declined by 6% in the fourth quarter to $1.03 compared to $1.09 in the fourth quarter of 2018. And adjusted diluted EPS declined $0.07 to $0.98 in the fourth quarter of 2019 from $1.05 in the fourth quarter of 2018.","For the full year, GAAP diluted EPS was $3.75, a 3% decrease from 2018 GAAP diluted EPS of $3.85. And adjusted diluted EPS was $3.74 for 2019, a 1% decrease from 2018 adjusted diluted EPS of $3.77.","Orders for the quarter were $2.200 billion, which resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02 to 1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $424 million in the fourth quarter and a record $1.502 billion for the full year or 140% and 131% of adjusted net income respectively.","Net of capital spending, our free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $352 million and the full -- for the full year was a record $1.207 billion or 117% and 105% of adjusted net income respectively. These are excellent cash flow results and reflect the hard work of the management team around the world and carefully managing working capital in the uncertain economic environment in 2019.","From a working capital standpoint, inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were $1.3 billion, $1.7 billion and $867 million respectively at the end of December. And inventory days, days' sales outstanding and payable days were 80, 73 and 53 days respectively, all within our normal range.","The cash flow from operations of $424 million along with proceeds from exercise of stock options of $100 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand of approximately $95 million net of translation were used primarily to repay $366 million in borrowings under our commercial paper programs and other facilities, fund dividend payments of $74 million, fund net capital expenditures of $72 million on acquisitions of $47 million repurchased approximately $43 million of the company's stock and fund acquisitions of and distributions to non-controlled interest of $18 million.","During the quarter, the company repurchased 400,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $103 under the $2 billion stock repurchase plan bringing total repurchases for the year to 6.5 million shares or $600 million.","At December 31st, cash and short-term investments were $909 million, the majority of which is held outside of the U.S. And at year-end, the company had issued $395 million under its U.S. and euro commercial paper programs. The company's cash and availability under our credit facilities totaled $3 billion.","Total debt at December 31st was $3.6 billion and net debt was $2.7 billion. The adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter and full year 2019 was $522 million and $2 billion, respectively. In summary this is a strong quarter and full year for the company financially especially in light of the continued uncertainty across the global markets.","And I will now turn it over to Adam who will provide an overview of the business and comment on current trends.","Adam Norwitt","Well, Craig, thank you very much and welcome to all of you to our first call of the new decade here in 2020 and I hope it's not too late for me to wish everybody on the call a Happy New Year.","As Craig mentioned I'm going to highlight some of our achievements here in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2019. I'll then spend a few moments to discuss our trends and progress across our served markets. And then finally I'll make some comments on our outlook for the first quarter and the full year 2020. And of course we'll reserve some time at the end for some questions.","Our results in the fourth quarter were stronger than expected as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in both sales and adjusted EPS. And that's despite an ongoing environment of uncertainty in the global economy.","Sales were down by 3% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currencies but reached $2.151 billion. On an organic basis as Craig described, sales were down by 8% and that was largely driven by the significant reductions in the mobile devices and mobile networks markets.","The company booked $2.2 billion in orders in the quarter and that represented a strong book-to-bill of 1.02 to 1. Despite our decline in sales in the quarter adjusted operating margins held up very strongly reaching 20% and the company generated excellent operating cash flow of $424 million in the quarter, really another reflection of the quality of the company's earnings.","I just have to say I remain very proud of the Amphenol team. Our results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst a very dynamic economic environment all while driving superior operating performance in the quarter.","Also very pleased to announce that just in the last several days we closed the acquisition of EXA Thermometrics. EXA is a provider of high technology temperature sensors based in Bangalore, India with annual sales of approximately $10 million.","And while EXA is still a relatively small company, the company strengthens our overall sensor offering and expands our sensor manufacturing footprint to India. EXA represents an excellent complement to our growing portfolio of sensor products, which have become a core pillar of Amphenol's overall interconnect offering.","As we welcome this outstanding new team to the Amphenol family, we remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for Amphenol. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring these new companies into our family remains a core competitive advantage for the company.","Now let me just make a couple of comments about the full year 2019. And despite the many challenges in the global economy in 2019, it was a successful year for Amphenol. Amidst significant organic declines in the mobile devices market as well as moderations in demand in several other markets that we discussed early last year, we are very pleased to have just surpassed our 2018 sales levels.","Our full year operating -- full year adjusted operating margins once again reached 20%. And this strong level of profitability enabled us to achieve adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.74. And very importantly, we generated record operating and free cash flow of $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion respectively both of which are excellent confirmations of the company's superior execution together with our disciplined working capital management.","Our acquisition program created great value for the company in 2019 with nine new companies added to the Amphenol family in the year. These acquisitions which included SSI, Aorora, Copec, Charles Industries, CONEC, Bernd Richter, GJM, Cablescan and finally XGiga expanded our position across a broad array of technologies and markets.","We're excited that these acquisitions represent expanded platforms for the company's future performance, in particular because of the outstanding and talented individuals that have joined the Amphenol organization. These new Amphenolians as we call them deepen our already strong bench of leaders around the world.","In addition in 2019, we deployed further our capital by buying back over 6.5 million shares under our share buyback program, while also increasing our quarterly dividend by 9%. Amphenol's long-term mission is to be the enabler of the electronics revolution.","Through the organic development efforts of Amphenol's entrepreneurial organization, together with the benefits of our acquisition program, we have expanded our relationships with a broadening array of customers across all of our diversified end markets. This has resulted in the company's strengthening our position across the many segments of the electronics industry.","And while the overall market environment in 2019 was highly uncertain, our agile entrepreneurial management team is very confident that we have built further strength from which we can drive superior performance into the long-term.","Now, turning to our trends and progress across our served markets. I would just note that we continue to be very pleased that the company's balanced and broad end market diversification remains a real high-value asset for the company. No single end market in the year represented more than 20% of our sales.","And we believe this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets, while also exposing us to all of the leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry.","Now, turning first to the military market, the military market represented 13% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 12% of our sales for the full year 2019. Sales again grew very strongly from prior year increasing by a greater-than-expected 30% in the fourth quarter, driven by growth across essentially all segments in the military market including in particular, military vehicles, rotorcraft, and airframe applications. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 7% with very strong performance given the normal fourth quarter seasonality that we've typically seen.","For the full year 2019, we're very pleased that our military sales grew by an outstanding 23% in U.S. dollars and 22% organically, reflecting broad-based strength across virtually all segments of the market.","Our organization working in the military market has worked so hard for many years to strengthen our broad technology position, while increasing our capacity to serve customers across all of the segments of this important market. And I can just tell you that our superior performance in 2019 is a great reflection of the results of their efforts.","Given the ongoing favorable military spending environment, our team continues to solidify our leadership position by ensuring that we execute on this increased demand by supporting the many next-generation technologies that are required for modern military hardware.","Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to decrease slightly from these fourth quarter levels. And for the full year 2020, we expect to achieve mid to high single-digit sales growth on top of our already strong sales levels from 2019.","Turning to the commercial air market, that market represented 5% of our sales both in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2019. And sales in the fourth quarter increased by a stronger-than-anticipated 15% as overall demand from commercial aircraft manufacturers continued to be robust.","Sequentially, our sales increased by 8% from the third quarter, also a very strong performance. For the full year 2019, we're pleased that our sales grew by 14% as we benefited from broad design-ins of our next-generation interconnect products on new aircraft.","Looking into 2020, we do expect a sequential moderation in sales from these levels in the first quarter. For the full year, we expect sales to remain at roughly 2019's level as increased sales onto new jet platforms is offset by some impact from one program's widely reported production delays.","Regardless of this more muted outlook for 2020, we remain encouraged by the company's strong technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems that are integrated into those airplanes. And we look forward to benefiting from that position for many years to come.","The industrial market represented 19% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 20% of our sales for the full year 2019. Sales in industrial in the fourth quarter grew by a bit stronger-than-expected 7% from prior year, driven largely by the contributions from our acquisitions completed over the past year.","On an organic basis, sales actually declined by 3% as growth in instrumentation, alternative energy, and medical was more than offset by moderations in other segments of the industrial market. On a sequential basis sales reduced by 2% from the third quarter reflecting continued moderation in the overall industrial market in particular in Europe.","For the full year 2019, sales in the industrial market grew by 4% in U.S. dollars and were down by 3% organically as growth in medical, factory automation, rail mass transit and oil and gas were offset by moderations in other segments of the industrial market. We remain very pleased with the company's broad position in the worldwide industrial market.","And while the overall environment in 2019 became increasingly uncertain as the year progressed, we added several outstanding acquisitions, which strengthened our overall position. Through both our acquisition program, as well as our organic innovations, we've developed a very broad array of products across a diversified range of exciting segments within the global industrial market.","We're proud of this success and look forward to realizing the benefits from our efforts in the industrial market for many years to come.","Looking into the first quarter 2020, we anticipate a slight decrease in sales from these levels as demand continues to be uncertain particularly in Europe. And for the full year 2020, we expect to realize low single-digit sales growth as we continue to benefit from our acquisitions, as well as our organic growth efforts.","The automotive market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter and 19% of our sales for the full year. Sales were stronger than we had expected coming into the quarter with revenues growing by 8% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currency driven by the contributions from our acquisitions completed earlier in the year.","On an organic basis sales were flat from prior year as slowing vehicle volumes offset increased sales of products sold into new vehicle electronics applications. Sequentially, our automotive sales increased by 3% in the fourth quarter as we benefited from several new program launches.","For the full year 2019, our sales in the automotive market grew by 3% in U.S. dollars and 6% in local currency, but were down by 2% organically reflecting the benefits of our acquisitions as well as our broad array of new products into next-generation applications offset by the overall slowing of the worldwide automotive market. We continue to benefit from our long-term and consistent strategy of expanding our range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products both organically and through acquisitions to enable a wide array of onboard electronics across a diversified range of vehicles made by auto manufacturers around the world.","Looking into the first quarter 2020, we expect sales to moderate slightly from these levels. And for the full year 2020, we expect a low single-digit sales increase for the automotive market. And while the overall market remains uncertain, we're confident that our broadened range of high-technology solutions positions us for continued growth in automotive into the future.","The mobile devices market represented 15% of our sales in the quarter and 13% of our sales for the full year 2019. Sales in the mobile devices market exceeded our expectations coming into the fourth quarter growing 9% sequentially from the third quarter as our team executed extremely well to satisfy increased demand from customers making both smartphones and tablets.","Compared to prior year sales were down by 35%, but which was better than we had expected especially in light of the very strong fourth quarter, we had had in the fourth quarter of 2018.","For the full year 2019, sales in the mobile devices market decreased by 20%. And as we discussed extensively at the time of our first quarter earnings release, our reduction in sales for both the fourth quarter and the full year were driven really by changes in available content due to architectural shifts and product designs of certain smartphone models.","We're pleased that the team outperformed our previously revised expectations of an approximately 30% reduction for the full year, a great testament to our mobile device team's continued agility in the face of an always volatile market.","Looking into the first quarter 2020, we anticipate a relatively normal seasonal sequential decline of approximately 25%. And for the full year 2020, we expect sales in the mobile device market to be flat with 2019 levels. Although 2019 was a difficult year for this market after our record performance in 2018, I can just tell you that we come into 2020 in a great position to capitalize on any future opportunities for growth that may emerge.","Our leading array of antennas, interconnect and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices. And while this market will no doubt remain one of the most volatile, our outstanding team working in mobile devices looks forward to continuing to drive value for our customers and for Amphenol into the future.","The mobile networks market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter and 8% of our sales for the full year 2019. Sales in this market decreased from prior year by a bit more-than-expected 20% in U.S. dollars and 31% organically, as we were impacted by reduced demand from both OEMs and operators.","As we discussed extensively back in July, the U.S. government restrictions on sales to certain Chinese entities, ultimately resulted in many operator and OEM customers reassessing both their build-out plans and inventory levels leading to lower demand for our products.","For the full year 2019, our sales were down slightly from prior year but were down organically by 9% as the benefits of our acquisitions completed earlier in the year were offset by the dynamics I just mentioned.","Looking ahead, while we expect sales in the first quarter to increase modestly from these levels, we do expect sales for the full year to be down in the low single-digits as the full year impact from the U.S. government restrictions as well as the associated effects are partially offset by increased demand from operators who are beginning their next-generation network build-outs.","Regardless of the challenges that arose in the mobile networks market in 2019, we're confident in the company's long-term position in this important and exciting industry. Our team continues to work aggressively to expand our opportunity with next-generation equipment and networks.","And as customers plan for their advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers around the world. This creates a significant long-term expansion potential for the company.","The Information Technology and Data Communications market represented 20% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 19% of our sales for the full year 2019. Sales in the quarter were stronger than expected rising by 3% in U.S. dollars, but down by 3% organically from prior year, as the contributions from the Charles Industries and XGiga acquisitions, together with stronger sales of server-related products were offset by lower sales of products incorporated into networking and storage systems.","Sequentially, our sales in IT\/datacom grew by a stronger-than-expected 10% from the third quarter, as our team capitalized on stronger demand in servers and storage and, to a lesser extent, networking products.","For the full year 2019, our sales in the IT\/datacom market were flat from prior year in U.S. dollars and down by 3% organically, a really strong performance by our team, given the impact of the U.S. government restrictions and the associated knock-on effects we discussed earlier.","These results were a direct result of our team's continued efforts at developing industry-leading products across a wide array of technologies, including in particular high-speed and power products.","In addition, our team continued to adapt quickly to the changing market environment, including, by capitalizing on the expanding importance of web service providers, a group of customers that grew strongly in 2019.","Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to moderate from these levels. And for the full year 2020, we anticipate sales to remain flat to 2019 levels, as the full year effect from the U.S. government restrictions are offset by continued growth of next-generation products sold into a wide array of customers, including those web service providers.","We remain very encouraged by the company's strong technology position in the global IT\/datacom market. Our customers around the world continue to drive their equipment to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power.","In turn, our team remains singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT\/datacom through their ongoing development of a wide range of next-generation technologies.","Finally, the broadband market represented 4% of our sales, both in the fourth quarter and the full year. As we had expected, sales decreased by 6% from prior year as spending levels from broadband operators continued to moderate.","On a sequential basis, sales decreased by 6%, also from the third quarter. There's no question that 2019 was a challenging year in this market, as our sales declined by 7% from prior year on reduced levels of operator capital spending.","Looking ahead, while we expect sales to moderate slightly from these levels in the first quarter, for the full year we expect our sales in the broadband market to increase in the low double digits, as operators begin to ramp up their network upgrades.","Despite the challenging conditions in the broadband market last year, we remain encouraged by the company's continually expanding range of products, together with our strong positions with customers around the world. We continue to position ourselves as the most flexible supplier, thereby ensuring that the company can benefit as operators begin to increase network investments.","So, just in summary, while 2019 was a challenging year in many respects, I come out of the year extremely proud of our team's performance. Amidst a very uncertain market environment and in the face of many unexpected dynamics that developed during the year, the Amphenol organization has clearly continued to execute extraordinarily well.","Through our dual-pronged approach of growing both organically and through our acquisition program, the company continues to expand our market position, while strengthening our financial performance.","Amphenol's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages: our leading technology; our increasing position with customers in diverse markets; our worldwide presence; a lean and flexible cost structure; highly effective acquisition program; and most importantly, our agile entrepreneurial management team.","Now, turning to our outlook and given the continued heightened level of market uncertainty and based of course on constant exchange rates, we now expect for the first quarter and full year 2020 the following.","For the first quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1.960 billion to $2 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.85 to $0.87. This represents a sales increase versus prior year of 0% to 2% in U.S. dollars and 1% to 3% in local currency and a decrease versus prior year adjusted diluted EPS of 2% to 4%. For the full year 2020, we expect sales in the range of $8.240 billion to $8.400 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.76 to $3.84.","For the full year, this guidance represents both sales growth, represents sales growth of flat to up 2% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 1% to 3%. We're encouraged by the company's performance in 2019 and all of us at Amphenol look forward to driving renewed strength going forward into 2020 even amidst the many dynamics around the world.","I remain very confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon our results in 2019 and to continue to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability.","And with that operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The question and answer period will now begin. Please limit to only question and one follow-up. And the first question is from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Your line is now open.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I have a question and a follow-up. I guess to start with, when I look at the calendar 2020 EPS guide, I think the implication there is that incremental operating margins are around 5%. I want to make sure A, I'm getting that math right. But if so, what is the delta versus the historical target that you guys have talked about in the 25% range?","Craig Lampo","Yes. Thanks, Amit. I actually don't think your math is right. If you look at the implied guidance which is the kind of 1% to 3% on the EPS for the full year growth and the 0% to 2% on the revenue growth, what that would really imply is a little bit under our normal kind of conversion margin going into 2020.","And I guess I would kind of stress that we really think that's an impressive profitability conversion considering that we still do have some drag related to the acquisitions that we have done. And even though we have made some progress there, we do still have some work to do in regards to some of the acquisitions.","As you know there -- they are done throughout the year. So we're not -- there is some time to get those up to the average level of profitability. And -- but if you take those out, actually we're converting well above our normal range. And that would also just reflect the actions that we've taken that aren't reflected at -- the cost of which aren't reflected in 2020 as well as other actions that the company's really done a great job of to ensure the bottom line profitability and really these low rates of organic growth that we're guiding to in 2020. So, really happy with the conversion and ultimate profitability implied in our guide.","Amit Daryanani","Perfect. Thank you for that. And I guess Adam, on mobile devices, when we think about the flat guide for calendar 2020 sales and I realize it's early in the year for you guys.","Just help me understand the delta between the guide here versus what you guys did last year or guided for last year. Does that essentially reflect that you don't see any negative change to your allocation opportunity in calendar 2020? Is that really the message there? Or is there a bigger message in them, which is the content will be as well in calendar 2020?","Adam Norwitt","Yes. Well thank you Amit. And I think every year we get into that discussion about our guidance for mobile devices with good reason. It's a very difficult market to guide to and you'll remember our -- my track record over a number of years is not the greatest at being accurate.","All that being said, we came into last year with an outlook of being down in the mid to high or high teens. And in fact we ended up even though we adjusted the guidance down early in the year but our team ended up really doing a great job in the second half and ended up for the year down in mobile devices by 20% and in fact 19% in local currencies. So, we're kind of spot on last year, which was the first in a many year period.","I think our flat guidance is based on what we see today. I think our team has done an excellent job of positioning ourselves well, making sure that we're present on lots of different new platforms that we're getting at least our fair share if not more than our fair share of a variety of allocations and that we're working on lots and lots of different mobile devices.","And I think that last point is a very important one. People talk a lot about mobile devices in terms of just a phone or a smartphone or something like that. But there is an extraordinary array of devices more and more, which becomes smart devices and ultimately one calls them a mobile device.","I mean, I was just as you know out in Las Vegas a week and a half ago at the Consumer Electronics Show and seeing that essentially everything has become smart. You cannot find a category of a thing that one uses in one's life and not find at the Consumer Electronics Show a smart version thereof.","And these smart devices ranging from frying pans to drink mixers to things you put on your wrist to exercising devices and of course to smartphones and tablets, laptops, wearables, headphones, all of those things these continue to create new and wonderful opportunities for our company to find ways to grow as our products can help our customers make their products better. And that remains.","And I'd just remind everybody our philosophy in mobile devices, our philosophy remains that we will participate in those products where we can help our customers add value.","And just the constant growth of the types of products that are out there, I think creates a good opportunity for us. All that being said, it's a very volatile market. It's a very, very hard to predict market. And as we sit here today just in the third week of January of 2020 flat is what we see. And you can bet our team will do everything they can to capitalize on any incremental opportunities that may arise.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Mark Delaney","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and I had a question and a follow-up as well. I guess first on the macroeconomic environment. Adam, you talked about how some of the events that transpired in 2019 around export bans and tariffs caused some challenges in revenue in certain markets and certainly understand some of those factors remain in place today. But with the phase one trade agreement being put in place between the U.S. and China, are you seeing that translate into improved order rates in any areas?","Adam Norwitt","Yes, I mean look we're very happy if the world's two largest economies can work their way towards a more peaceful coexistence economically. And so I think from that perspective, we applaud that there is this Phase one deal in a very macro standpoint.","All that being said, if you look at really what the Phase one deal really means, it does not roll back for example the vast majority of tariffs. And you'll remember well Mark, List 1, List 2, List 3. I mean, those tariffs are all still in place and those are tariffs that our team has done a fabulous job of managing through in 2019, and before, and we'll continue to manage through them going into this year.","The restrictions that are really part of a national security discussion as opposed to part of the trade discussion, none of those restrictions have really gone away. So, I wouldn't say that there are tangible benefits of the Phase 1.","But I think there's a huge intangible long term, which I very much applaud, which is that it's progress. And hopefully that will lead to more progress, which will lead to really resolving some of the more insidious parts of the trade war that have gone on so far.","Mark Delaney","Got it, that's helpful. My follow-up question was around the margin integration topic that was previously discussed. And maybe you can help us understand or remind us, how long it typically takes to integrate acquisitions in past situations?","And then along those lines, I remember in 2019, there were some higher-than-normal integration spending that was done, and to Amphenol's credit does not strip that out of non-GAAP earnings. But are there any higher-than-normal integration expenses that are planned in 2020 SG&A that's may be a part of that margin conversion rate that was mentioned? Thanks.","Craig Lampo","Yes, sure. Actually I'll start off with this kind of second part of your question first. I guess, I wouldn't -- these weren't -- these costs that we talked about in the third quarter really had nothing to do with integration spend related to acquisitions.","It really is related to the fact that based on the current demand levels and that we saw coming into the third and fourth quarter that we -- our general managers around the world those that really saw a reduction these are the things that we talked about really had adjusted their cost levels.","And there's -- in some cases this means headcount-related activities and there's a cost to that. And that's really what we saw in the third quarter, that isn't recurring neither in the fourth quarter really of any significance nor in our expectation from a guide perspective in 2020.","I mean, I say that with a caveat that that's based on the current demand environment. If there was some sort of an additional drop down or step down in the current demand environment, of course, we would take quick action and there could be some costs related to that. But certainly that's not our expectation and not included in our guidance.","In terms of the margins in regards to acquisitions and how long it takes us to get those margins up to the company average, I guess, I would say that it really is very dependent on the specific acquisitions.","Over the course of history, we've had ones as short as months and three to six months or so as it relates to companies like FCI and others that we've had. And then we've had to take -- some have taken years, and it really just depends. So I wouldn't necessarily say that I would nail down and say it's within one. There was a median to that or anything of that nature.","So, -- but we are -- I think we have a pretty good track record in regarding to doing that. The management team is very committed to getting the margins up over some period of time, and we do have an expectation. With that being said, there will be a bit of a drag on our margin in 2020, albeit not as significant as there was in 2019.","And if you look at our 2020 sequential margins kind of going throughout the year in terms of implied guidance where we start in the first quarter in terms of where we end up for 2020, you would see that there is expectation of some improvement which is partly from acquisitions and partly from just the underlying actions that we take from an organic perspective.","Operator","The next question is from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes, thank you. Adam I appreciate your comments around mobile devices, but just normal seasonality would imply mobile devices would be up quite significantly on a year-on-year basis.","So, should we conclude that there's just not enough visibility at this point to make that statement about how those trends are going to be at the back half of the year? Or do you actually expect seasonality to be sort of sub-seasonal this year? And I have a follow-up.","Adam Norwitt","Yes, I mean I don't know that the normal seasonality -- I mean normal is what in the mobile devices. There -- we -- I think our guidance would imply that there is still a strong second half pickup in our sales in the mobile devices in 2020. Is it as strong as it was this year? No, but I think that if you look this year from Q4 to Q1, we were down by more than 50%.","And so every year in mobile devices has a little bit of a different cadence across the quarters depending on how things go. We had that extraordinary quarter in the fourth quarter of 2018.","We then had a very significant, more than half reduction sequentially into Q1 of 2019. This quarter, we anticipate a relatively modest sequential reduction in the first quarter; let's call it a more normal sequential reduction in the kind of mid-20s. And so I wouldn't say that there is any sort of big categorical difference in terms of how that cadence goes throughout the year.","Wamsi Mohan","Okay, thanks Adam. And then we've seen some semiconductor companies talk about a near-term bottom-end demand in place. I'm wondering if you view any lead-time movement indicating anything similar for you or how you would categorize the broader demand environment as you're entering this year. Thank you.","Adam Norwitt","Yes, I mean I'm not maybe as good at finding where are bottoms and where are tops. And part of that may be because distribution is a relatively small proportion of our sales and I think there are plenty of companies who have relatively high distribution content who maybe see that a little bit more clearly on sell-throughs and inventory levels and all that's associated with distribution.","I think the overall demand environment remains very uncertain. I'm pleased with how our team did in the fourth quarter. I'm especially pleased that we had a positive book-to-bill in the fourth quarter which gives me some sense of confidence.","At the same time there are a few of our markets where the first half of last year has a very difficult comparison to the first half of this year. And for one I would point out mobile networks where clearly we will see in the first half of this year because of all the dynamics that we already have discussed a few times, we'll see that market being down relatively significantly in the first half and that has some impact on the overall outlook for the year. But are we at a bottom? I think it really depends by market. And I think it's not always easy for us sitting where we sit to pick are we or are we not at the bottom.","Operator","The next question is from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes. Thank you. First question Adam, just on the automotive market. If you can just touch on kind of from a production perspective, how you're seeing things at the start of this year? And then you mentioned a couple of new programs. So any highlights you call out from a content perspective that are important for this year?","Adam Norwitt","Yes, I think the auto market clearly as we went through the course of last year and we talked about this a lot in the middle of the year, we did not see a recovery in the auto market that we had anticipated would have come in the second half. And that ultimately kept our performance more muted than we would have liked.","Now all that being said, I think that we were in the fourth quarter as I mentioned flat on an organic basis. For the full year, just down by a very small amount organically. And that's in a worldwide automotive market, where you probably know the numbers better than I do, but I think it's like 6%, 7% volumes down.","I think there's lots of different forecasts for what the automotive market will be in 2020, but none of them seem to be so rosy in terms of the outlook. I think our team, we don't go about forecasting our business by saying what is production and what is content.","But I think very clearly with our outlook to grow in the low single digits in 2020, I think that continues to represent gains in content by the company. And as it relates to new programs I mean, we are always working on lots of new programs that in particular are dealing with new electronic systems in the car things like electric drivetrains, things like new emission systems, things like new passenger comfort and infotainment systems and when we looked at our performance in the fourth quarter that was not clearly driven on a sequential basis, where we grew 3% on a quarter-to-quarter basis. That was not driven by auto volumes. That was really driven by some of these new programs that we've been working hard on for a number of years starting to ramp-up. And we would expect to see some of that to continue into 2020.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on mobile networks you talked about just some of the uncertainty kind of a ripple through effect of the Huawei restrictions. Any signals you're getting from operators in terms of just how they're feeling about the pacing through this year?","Adam Norwitt","Yes. I mean, operators don't give you the longest-term forecasts. And that's one of the things about being in the service provider market. And we know how to work in service provider markets. We've gotten very good at it over the years. And forecasting in the service provider market is not so easy.","And I think the operators are -- some of them are still of the mind to say, let's wait and see how this whole thing shakes out vis-\u00e0-vis which vendors can we use and not use in particular in places outside of the U.S. I think in the U.S., the problem does -- isn't related necessarily to that, because that's pretty well defined.","But it's more in the U.S. you continue to have uncertainties around corporate combinations and the sort of is the equipment ready? And is the economics around 5G there to support significant investment increases? And I think those are still yet to be seen.","But look we expect in 2020 to see some next-generation network build-out not enough to offset the comparisons that I talked about in one of the prior questions. But certainly we do expect to see that with some of our operator customers around the world.","And to the extent that, they decide to accelerate those or that the economics become more clear or the supply base becomes more clear, we will be right there to support them whenever they need us.","Operator","The next question is from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Samik Chatterjee","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Happy New Year to you guys as well. If I can just clarify, I think you said industrial segment you expect growth in 2020. Is that an expectation on the organic sales as well? And if so kind of which are the geographies you're seeing improving trends? And what's your latest assessment of the inventory situation there?","Adam Norwitt","Yes. So, I think the answer is yes we expect some modest amount of organic growth in the year in industrial. I think across which segments, it's a little hard to say that in advance. No doubt about it.","I mean we had good momentum in industrial finishing the year in instrumentation, alternative energy and medical. I mean those all seem to have continued outlooks of favorability but it's very hard to forecast which of the many segments of the industrial market are going to ultimately drive the result.","Relative to distribution and the sort of stock positions and all of that I think we did see over the course of the year in 2019, relatively significant reductions in industrial distribution between the first half and the second half. I don't say that we have a big recovery for that embedded into our numbers.","I think a lot of distributors are waiting and seeing to see ultimately when is the end demand going to come back in those markets which they serve. All that being said, what we feel very good about in the industrial market beyond just our core position we've made some outstanding acquisitions over the course of the last year, which have really built our product offering and our penetration into those various segments of the industrial market in a really significant way.","And so our team is working very hard around the world to leverage those new product offerings to make sure that we can continue to become ever more important to our customers. And to the extent those customers ultimately have more demand to fulfill I think that will be a real tough choice for them to work with in 2020 and beyond.","Samik Chatterjee","Okay. And if I can just follow-up on the cash flow. Craig, how are you thinking about kind of operating cash flow for 2020 given that you had a sizable improvement here going from 2018 to 2019? Are there more kind of working capital benefits that we should expect in a flat operating profit environment in 2020?","Craig Lampo","Sure. Thanks. No, I mean the company certainly has historically been and continues to have a very strong cash flow generation. And I think in years where the organic growth is a little bit lower such as 2019, we would expect to generate stronger-than-average cash flow versus those years that we grow really strongly organically such as 2018, where the cash flow is a little bit lower than the average.","I guess what I would say about the expectation 2020, is I wouldn't expect any significant change from kind of the average cash flow conversion that we typically have. It's -- so I would expect that same kind of rough within the range of 100% of net income free cash flow conversion in the 90 -- mid-90s, maybe, in that range and over 100% kind of from an operating cash flow perspective, which basically is what we're going to expect over the longer term from a cash flow generation perspective.","But I would tell you that we're extremely happy about the cash flow generation. And, in 2019, we certainly deployed that, given all the acquisitions that we had and certainly the share repurchases.","So, I think, it's really a strategic advantage of the company, generating this level of cash. And I think the 2019 cash flow that we generated was just an example of that. We're really proud of that.","Operator","The next question is from Shawn Harrison from Longbow. Your line is now open.","Shawn Harrison","Afternoon, everybody. Double-digit growth in the broadband business is something, I guess, I haven't heard for a while. So, maybe Adam, if you could delve into why the operators are finally looking to spend here in 2020.","Adam Norwitt","Yes. Shawn, sorry, either I misspoke or you misheard, because I said -- I think, I said low single-digit growth in broadband. So, I apologize for that, if it was my misstatement. ","Shawn Harrison","Okay. So, low single-digit growth, never mind on that.","Adam Norwitt","Which is still good, given the last two years.","Shawn Harrison","Correct, correct, considering the history. Okay. Then moving on. Then the IT\/datacom business is flattish organic growth. If you exclude the entity ban impact, where would you expect to see organic growth in that business in 2020?","Adam Norwitt","Yes, I mean, that's a little bit hard to say. I think, we feel very good about our position in that -- in the IT\/datacom market. Clearly, the first half has a more magnified impact, because of the various effects. And it's not just the ban itself, but also the knock-on effects that we discussed, I think, pretty extensively back in our second quarter discussion.","So, I -- what would it be organically? I don't know, low single digits, something like that. If I sit where I sit today, which is the very beginning of the year, thinking about a market that is not always the easiest to forecast, maybe something like that around those levels. But no doubt about it. There are parts of that market where we continue to make great progress irregardless of what's happening in the overall environment.","And I mentioned, our progress that we've made in web service providers, which had really great growth last year, double-digit growth organically, in an environment where those customers, that part of the IT datacom world is really striving for a real step function increase in bandwidth and processor capability, in order to support just all what is being supported, a lot of which is, as you know, very well, getting people to watch videos on their phones and tablets and over-the-top on their TVs at home.","And that extraordinary increase in video traffic continues to drive just a lot of demand for the next-generation higher speed products. So, what will that ultimately be, it's hard to say at this stage. I think, the guidance that we've given to be flat for the year is a very good guidance, given all the dynamics. And, obviously, our team is going to work very hard to outperform that if they can.","Operator","The next question is from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is now open.","Matt Sheerin","Yes, thank you. And hello, Adam and Craig. A question, Adam, regarding your sensor business. You seem pretty excited about that small acquisition in India. You've made several acquisitions over the years. And, I know, there's a mix between both industrial and auto.","Could you update us on where you stand there in terms of revenue run rate, the end market mix? And also, how much are you seeing in terms of traction with doing complete subsystems for customers that include both the sensor and interconnect technologies?","Adam Norwitt","Yes. Well, thanks very much, Matt. Look, we are very excited about our sensor business. And yes, it's a very small acquisition and maybe I sound a little more excited than the scale of it. And I think, the reason for that is a few-fold. Number one, it is our first acquisition that we've made in India of a private company.","And it gives us a new base of low-cost manufacturing at a time when diversification of low cost seems to be not a bad idea in many respects. And I think this EXA will really be a fabulous space for us to support the world which they do already.","And in addition, it gives us really a direct on-the-ground access to the Indian market for sensors, which we have not had before. So, that's something that's very new. And we would really anticipate in the future that that team will become a beachhead for us in a very, very important market in particular in the industrial market, but also in automotive, military and otherwise.","In terms of where do we stand in our scale in sensors, we're a lot bigger than we were before. We don't talk publicly about exactly what the size of our sensors is. But you can piece that together relatively well by looking at the disclosed sizes of all of our acquisitions and knowing that we've grown our sensor business organically at a relatively robust pace during that time period.","What do we look forward to in terms of that sort of value-add offering? I can tell you that now that we are six years in to having owned our first sensor company which was the GE Advanced Sensor acquisition, we see a lot of opportunities with customers to give them a total solution of interconnect and sensor products, which ultimately allows them to simplify their approach to their vendor base, to have one company on whom they can rely for that total system and especially a company that has that harsh environment capabilities that we have had for so many decades, in fact the whole history of Amphenol.","And I think that that proposition, which was originally more of a hypothesis when we acquired the Advanced Sensors Business six years ago is clearly a platform for us for long-term growth in the sensor and the interconnect market. And we look forward to taking advantage of that for many years to come.","Matt Sheerin","Okay, very good. That\u2019s it from me. Thanks a lot.","Adam Norwitt","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","The next question is from Will Stein from SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Will Stein","Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong Q4 results including the inventory performance. That said, Adam, I'm wondering if you can comment on inventory conditions in the channel? I know you're not a huge user of the channel, but any view into that category's inventory levels and similarly at your direct customers, any visibility that you could comment on?","Adam Norwitt","Yes, I think the inventory conditions in the channel again it's a relatively small proportion of our sales just 15% of our sales through distribution. And we get some visibility across that 15%. I'd say that the inventory positions are healthy. I would say that they are relative to the end demand of the market.","So, we have some proportion of our distribution which is in the military market, where there's very robust demand and where we've done a great job of satisfying that demand.","And so maybe inventories have come a little bit up in that area. And conversely we've seen them come a little bit down in areas like the industrial market. But I wouldn't point to any significant disruptions that we would see there in inventory.","Relative to our direct customers there's no question and we talked about this in the middle of the year that our customers following in particular after the events of the second quarter between the U.S. and China, a number of our customers looked at their overall inventory position and decided that maybe they had a little too much.","And I'd say that those positions as best as we can tell because we don't have any visibility that's a real visibility. But at least the anecdotal evidence is that they -- those positions are working down and to a little bit more of a healthy environment.","Will Stein","That's helpful. If I could have one more, I want to revisit the mobile device end market again. I know this is very difficult to forecast. So, you've provided us with a view that's flat year-over-year. But there are some pretty big architecture changes coming this year or at least those are anticipated relative to 5G, certainly maybe Wi-Fi 6 we'll see more of that as well. And these architectural changes drive potential for step function different content from various companies including Amphenol.","I'm wondering when we should expect to hear about any update. Or when does Amphenol have some better visibility into what the content situation looks like? Is that during Q1 event, during Q2? Any clarity on that would help. Thank you.","Adam Norwitt","Yes. I mean, look we always struggle with this here in the first quarter Will as you know coming up with a guidance and knowing when we have clarity. I think we usually have decent clarity at least in our design-in position sometime into the second quarter.","But look I think the guidance that we've given is based on a very, very rigorous look at all of our design-in positions and the outlooks from the customers, obviously, taking some with grains of salt.","In terms of the next-generation architectures I mean the good news about these architectural changes whether that be 5G, whether that be Wi-Fi 6 or something else the good news about them is they tend to stack on each other as opposed to replace something else because if you take 5G as an example, you will not buy a phone if it only works for 5G. You will not buy a tablet if it only works for 5G, because the 5G networks are going to be relatively minimalistic up until -- for a number of years to come.","And thus it has to be an additional functionality in that device, which has then backwards compatibility to 4G network, LTE to 3G. And you know what sometimes you're driving through a part of the country and some of those parts of the country seem to even be in Connecticut where you don't even have 3G. You have 2G or Edge or whatever they have to call it. And phone got to work. You've got to be able to call 911. You got to be able to make at least a phone call even if you cannot watch your Netflix movie at the same time.","And because of that these devices become more complex. They may add some type of architecture of 5G whether its antenna or the whole signal path associated with it. But ultimately it increases the complexity, which creates opportunities for us all things being equal.","Now, I say all things being equal because every new device has a different cut of how they're going to architect it a different approach and that's why you have to be so flexible and dynamic and innovative as a supplier into that market. But I think those are things that our team has really nailed down for many, many years.","And so what that 5G will bring, I think at a minimum it doesn't make things worse. And can it create opportunities? I think certainly it can. And the same goes with something like a Wi-Fi 6, which maybe will slowly take over for the higher speeds that it entails and that can create new opportunities for us over the long-term.","Operator","The next question is from Deepa Raghavan from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Deepa Raghavan","Hey, good afternoon Adam and Craig. Adam question for you first. Do you -- overall, do you feel fundamentally better about the macro environment than you did three months or six months ago? And does the guidance contemplate some of the cycle recovery prospects in automotive, industrial or semis? I mean you touched on this earlier, but my question is, does the guidance -- does the guide contemplate any sort of recovery expectations similar to what you might have seen in prior historical cycle recoveries?","Adam Norwitt","Well, to your first question do I feel better than three to six months ago? Yes, I mean, six months ago was not the most fun having dealt with everything that we faced in Q2 and a relatively sudden impact of the restrictions and the various aspects of the trade war and other knock-on effects.","So, yes, I guess, I feel fundamentally better than I did at that time. Does our guide contemplate a recovery? I think arithmetically you can apply some sort of normal seasonalities and see that, yes, I mean, our second half is assumed to have some growth compared to the first half.","Now, that's not so odd for us. We do typically have a second half that's stronger than the first half. We had that in this last year. Even without the impact of the acquisitions, there was growth in the second half.","But I think that for sure we have some expectation. Is that a recovery with a capital R? Or is that a normalization? Or is that us also expanding our position on a variety of new programs? I would call it a good combination of all of the above.","Deepa Raghavan","Got it. My follow-up is with Craig. Craig, does the full year EPS guidance contemplate share buybacks? You've always talked about free cash -- a third of free cash flow being deployed towards share buybacks where possible. In the recent past you've done 50% or more the last few years, but you've got this M&A going on which I understand. But what's embedded in the full year 2020 guide? Thank you.","Craig Lampo","Yes. Sure. Thanks Deepa. Yes. So the 2020 guide does reflect some small level of repurchases that we would expect to do under normal course. So, I guess, I would also say that also what it reflects is that our share price is where it is. And not to get into the dynamics of how weighted average shares are calculated, but there is an impact when the share price is higher that actually increases your weighted average shares that does have some offsetting impact to the share repurchases. So, I guess in terms of how we would think about that is that there is some impact of both of those reflected in our guidance.","Operator","The next question is from Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Joseph Spak","Thanks for fitting me in here. I just wanted to quickly go back to the guidance. If we look at both the first quarter and the full year revenue guidance at the midpoint, it's about 1%, yet the guidance would imply the margins are a little bit softer in the first quarter than maybe the rest of the year. I know there could be some seasonality or maybe mix related, but is there anything specific we should be thinking about or what gets that higher in later in the year?","Craig Lampo","Yes. No, I think the margin in the first quarter I think reflect the fact that we're sequentially organically reducing by the 7-ish -- on the high end the 7%-ish sequential quarter. And that does bring with it a little bit higher than normal conversion.","On the downside, we talked about that in 2019 we're maybe close to 30% decline. And we're kind of in the 25% to 30% sequential decline from a conversion perspective into the first quarter which just normally brings with a little bit lower margins.","I think if you then look at the full year kind of implied guidance as I mentioned earlier, we do expect some increases there on from that maybe even a little bit higher than typical going into the rest of the year which again as I mentioned before, reflects work that we're doing in the base business as well as maybe some progress from an acquisition profitability perspective.","Joseph Spak","Thanks. And just as a follow-up on aerospace. You mentioned the 737 MAX as a headwind. I guess technically you were more diplomatic. I guess I just mentioned it. But can you just give us some indication of what you're really considering there in your guidance just so as we continue to follow the news and headlines there track how it should impact your outlook?","Adam Norwitt","Yes, I mean look I think first of all for the overall outlook of the company, there's not a program including the one you mentioned that is material to our overall outlook. But in that market commercial air which did represent for us for the full year just 5% of sales, one significant program can have some modest impact on your outlook and that's what I had here.","I mean our overall presumption is consistent with probably what everybody has read publicly in terms of timing. And I wouldn't say much more than that.","Operator","The next question is from Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment Research. Your line is now open.","Jim Suva","Thank you and Happy New Year to you and your team. And I have one question that is actually kind of the same question for both Adam and Craig. And that is as you look at 2020, what's kind of maybe the two or three variables or swing factors or end markets or items that you're really focused on?","Maybe A for Adam on the sales side and then B for the profitability side for Craig. Like for example does the integration cost really something you're really focused on from a margin perspective or the challenges in the aerospace or mobility for the sales side? I'm just trying to figure out what the top couple variables that you're kind of most keenly focused on for 2020 that could directionally go much better or potentially be some more risk? Thank you.","Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much Jim and Happy New Year to you as well. Look, I mean two variables end markets I mean we are focused really on making sure the company performs regardless of what risks emerge for us. I think we saw in 2019 many things that came about that we did not anticipate. And to categorize in advance well that could happen or this could happen, that's not how we operate the business.","The way we operate the business is we try to be prepared regardless. And so I can tell you that, our team fully expects that in 2020 there maybe unexpected external things that happen and occasionally some of those external things that happen can have some sort of effect on Amphenol, and it's up to our team to really make sure that that doesn't have any financial harm to the company.","And what you see in our results in 2019 is clearly that our team sprung into action quickly, dealt with whatever came our way, managed effectively and ultimately brought the company out of 2019 in a stronger position than we had come into it.","And I think that's the whole mantra for Amphenolians worldwide is we cannot necessarily control the environment, but we can control our agility in the face of that environment. And that's true inside of each of our markets. If in military there were a decline in spending, well, our team would deal with it. We would manage it.","And by the way, we would have just outstanding presence with customers who we have pleased so well during the course of this latest expansion, we would do a fabulous job of that.","We just talked about aerospace. I mean in the industrial market, we have such a great position now because of the acquisitions that we've made and the various new product developments that we are ready for whichever end market goes up, and we're ready to deal with it, if there is something that would happen within those segments that would not be as favorable.","And I could go through each of the markets in that way. I wouldn't say that, any of our markets sitting here where we sit has a different kind of risk of something external happening.","I would of course say that, some of our markets are a little easier to predict than others. The mobile devices being the one that's the hardest to predict on one side and maybe the military being the one that is a little bit more certain because of the length of the lead times and the spending patterns.","But I didn't answer your question in terms of two variables, but I can tell you that our team is focused on dealing with any variable that would come our way. And then maybe Craig, I'll let you talk about the -- ","Craig Lampo","Yes, yes. No, sure. I guess, there's a lot of things obviously have to be thinking about as we move into 2020. I mean, one of them will continue to be our acquisitions and bringing the profitability level up to the average of the company. I mean, we did 10 acquisitions over the last 13 months here and certainly met more before that.","And we are continuing to spend a lot of time to ensure that we're making the right decisions and helping those operations make those decisions to ensure that ultimately we get to that -- to get those profitability levels up.","And that's something I probably will spend the disproportionate share of my time on and along with all the other things that would typically do during the year that some of which Adam just mentioned in his prior comments.","So, anyways, again, I apologize for not talking about many, many different things, because we probably be on the phone for way too long here. But from an M&A perspective that will continue to be one of the things, I'll spend time on.","Jim Suva","Thank you for the answers. And we hope you also have a great 2020.","Adam Norwitt","Likewise, Jim.","Operator","The next question is from David Kelley from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","David Kelley","Hey, good afternoon and thanks for squeezing me in. Just one quick follow-up on the earlier automotive discussion, I'll pass it along. With CO2 emissions regulations ramping this year, are you seeing any meaningful change in content opportunity in Europe as customers are shifting their mix to electric vehicles?","Adam Norwitt","Yes. I mean, I think David that all these regulations whether they be CO2 emissions regulations, whether it be like PM2.5 kind of regulations, Euro VI, the China version thereof, I mean, all these regulations tend to create dislocations which requires then new technology solutions to meet with those regulations. And I think by and large, those are always great inflection points for our organization to take advantage of them with our new enabling technologies.","And so, I wouldn't just confine it to that universe of CO2 emissions in Europe, but rather just broadly as we see more regulatory impact in the automotive market, those do create opportunities long term and one that our team is well positioned to take advantage of.","We've done a great job on working in electric drivetrain over -- around the world. The biggest market for electric drivetrains has been at least so far in China and that's a place where our team has just done a fabulous job of positioning ourselves.","So, it's really great harsh environment, high-power interconnect solutions. But that's something we're doing really around the world. And so from that sort of micro example of electric drivetrains, we're very well positioned.","Each platform, you can't say that universally it is a positive when something goes from a combustion to an electric drivetrain. But by and large technological shifts like this are good because they create those inflection points and opportunities for new technology.","Operator","The next question is from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Your line is now open.","Joe Giordano","Hey, guys. Good afternoon.","Adam Norwitt","Good afternoon, Joe.","Craig Lampo","Hey, Joe.","Joe Giordano","Hey, I'm sorry not sure if you watch Curb Your Enthusiasm but Larry David said it's too late to wish people Happy New Year, you have three days he said, so just let you guys know.","Adam Norwitt","Let\u2019s do it in Valentine's Day, Joe.","Joe Giordano","Just for me to start on the Huawei restrictions is there -- how do you view the risk of permanent share loss to like local supply if that was like lifted over the next couple months? Like is that a market that we should think comes back for you guys? Or is it just -- it's been fulfilled locally that's unlikely to change again?","Adam Norwitt","Look I mean I think it's a broader question and it's one that we've I think talked about in prior calls which is not even just specific to one customer but is there a kind of a nationalistic purchasing that can happen in the world including in China but not exclusive to China, because of the nature of the various trade disputes that have happened over the last two or three years.","And I think what I've said consistently and we continue to absolutely maintain is that it may happen that the world becomes a more local world as opposed to a globalizing world and our team is ready for that regardless. And I think that's the real essence of how we operate in China, how we operate in India, how we operate in the U.S. or elsewhere, as we do that with local teams who give real localized support for their customers.","And because of that the original restrictions we were able to work through them and continue to support customers because we're not exporting technology. We're complying obviously with every law from the first minute those laws are implemented. But our teams are really developing, supporting, covering the customer, ensuring the quality doing everything in a local fashion really around the world.","And so to the extent that one day, one country decides that they're not going to buy from just American companies, we're still an American company. But I can tell you that our people are giving local support as if they were a Chinese, an Indian, a Macedonian, a German company as well. And that's a real differentiator for our company.","And so, as long as we can offer our customers truly special products that ultimately solve their problems and if we do that in a localized way, I'm confident that we'll be able to minimize any impacts from any of the geopolitical dynamics that have gone on here during the course of these last few years.","Joe Giordano","And then -- that's helpful. And then, last for me on the device. I know, we talked about device a lot. I just want to make sure I'm clear on something. When you're -- when you say you're -- it's impossible to figure out like a guide for this, I fully get that. But is your uncertainty at this point in the year around volumes of those phones that might ultimately be produced, or whether or not you're on these platforms in the first place?","Is that still like in front of you? I know a major company is coming out with something in March and then multiple later in the year? Like, do you know if you're on those? Or is it just, we don't know what the volumes -- have no idea what the volumes are going to be?","Adam Norwitt","Yes. It can be -- at this early in the year, it can be a combination of all of the above. I mean, our team is working on new programs all the time. But sometimes those programs they change pretty soon before they're released. You'd be surprised how dynamic the designs of consumer products can be and so you're not fixed until they're really starting to build the things and ship them in volume.","And so, our team continues to work very hard to maximize what our position is. In January, where we sit, it's not so easy to be able to tell exactly what's going to happen, even if we have a pretty good read on it, as good as we can have here in January.","But look no doubt about it, our team has demonstrated the flexibility that we're going to go out there and win absolutely everything that we can possibly win. We're going to maximize our allocation given the -- our discipline on cost and on price. And we're going to make sure that we can execute on whatever our customers put in front of us.","Operator","Our last question is from Steven Fox from Cross Research. Your line is now open.","Steve Fox","Hi. Good afternoon. I just had one big picture question, Adam. If I think about the organic sales growth decline you had in the quarter, I would imagine there's a lot of other companies in the fragmented industry getting in that are doing a lot worse. So, on one hand, I guess, I'm wondering, what you think about some of the smaller companies, how much they're struggling now, if it's temporary or secular?","And then on the other hand, given that you're looking for no growth again in earnings this year and I understand the broadband comments and the positive trend there, maybe, in the second half. But, like, when do we start thinking about this market as being the market you have to live with and maybe see a change in strategy? Thanks.","Adam Norwitt","Yes. Well, look, I mean, how are other companies doing here in the fourth quarter, smaller companies. I can tell you, if you don't have the diversity of Amphenol, if you don't have the reach of Amphenol, the breadth and the balance of Amphenol, the depth of technology, 2019 is not an easy year. There's no doubt about it. So, I can imagine that that could have been a tough year for many much tougher than what we saw.","I mean, you look at our whole performance for the year; we were down by 3% organically in the year. That is essentially the impact of mobile devices. I mean, mobile devices was down 20% for the full year and it was 17% of our sales in 2018. Just the math of it, is that represents just a bit more than 3% organic growth. All the other markets start to balance themselves out. And I think that's a testament to the diversification of the company.","Now, look, going into 2020, I can't hear you perfectly, Steve. But what I think you said is that we don't have earnings growth this year, but we have guided to 1% to 3% earnings growth and 0% to 2% U.S. dollar growth this year. And I think if we go back a year ago, it's not materially different than the guidance that we had coming into 2019.","I think it's a prudent guidance. It's a guidance that reflects the still highly uncertain environment and it's one that also reflects great efforts by the team to drive cost improvements, to drive value with our customers and ultimately to drive a strong performance.","And to the extent that there are opportunities for us to do better than that environment in the year, you can bet full well that everybody around Amphenol, all 74,000 of us are going to jump on those opportunities with full vigor and energy and thereby execute on them. So, I think it's actually a very strong outlook from that perspective, given the overall environment that we're in and the strong conversion as Craig talked about.","Steve Fox","Okay. Thank you. Sorry for the bad connection.","Adam Norwitt","Thanks so much, Steve. Operator, are there any more questions?","Operator","We show no further questions at this time.","Adam Norwitt","That's wonderful. Well, thank you, all very much. And again, despite Joe's reference, I will once more wish you all a Happy New Year and wish in particular that you have a great start to 2020. And we look forward to speaking with you all again here in about 90 days. Thanks so much.","Craig Lampo","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for attending today's conference and have a nice day."],"2099":["Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) Q4 2014 Earnings Conference Call January 21, 2015  1:00 PM ET","Executives","Adam Norwitt - Chief Executive Officer","Diana Reardon - Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley","Amitabh Passi - UBS","Matt Sheerin - Stifel","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research","Jim Suva - Citi","William Stein - SunTrust","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald","Ryan Hunter - Macquarie Securities Group","Operator","Hello and welcome to the Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain on the listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If anyone has objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce today\u2019s conference host, Ms. Diana Reardon. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.","Diana Reardon","Thank you. My name is Diana Reardon and I am Amphenol\u2019s CFO. I am here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO and we would like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter earnings call. Q4 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We will then have a question-and-answer session.","The company closed the fourth quarter with sales of $1.427 million and EPS excluding one-time items of $0.63 beating the high-end of the company\u2019s guidance and achieving new records of performance in both sales and earnings per share. Sales were up 15% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currencies compared to Q4 of 2013. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency effects, sales in Q4 were up 7%. From a sequential standpoint, sales were up 5% in U.S. dollars and 3% organically from Q3.","Breaking down sales into our two major components: our cable business, which comprised 6% of our sales was up 3% from last year; our interconnect business, which comprised 94% of our sales was up 15% from last year, reflecting the benefits of both good organic growth and the company\u2019s acquisition program. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.","For the full year, sales were $5.346 billion, up 16% in U.S. dollars and 8% organically over 2013, a very strong performance. Operating income, excluding one-time items, increased to $288 million in the quarter. Operating margin also excluding one-time items increased to 20.2% in Q4 compared to 19.7% last year and 19.9% last quarter. This represents the third consecutive quarter of ROS improvement in 2014. The sequential increase of 30 basis points in operating margin over the third quarter and the achievement in the quarter of a new record ROS of 20.2% resulted from an increase in operating margins in our interconnect business.","From a segment perspective, in the cable segment, margins were 12.1%, down from 12.5% last quarter and 12.2% last year primarily due to the impact of market pricing and some impact from product mix. In our interconnect business, margins increased to 22.4%, up 30 basis points from last quarter and 60 basis points from last year. We are very, very pleased with the company\u2019s operating margin achievement both with the full year achievement of 19.6%, excluding one-time items, which reflects the impact earlier in 2014 of the lower than average profitability level of certain acquisitions and in particular with a consistent quarterly improvement and profitability during the year culminating in the achievement of 20.2% ROS in Q4.","The improvement in ROS achieved consistently during the year reflects excellent operating execution both organically and in our acquisition program in addition to aggressive cost management. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company\u2019s entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in what certainly continues to be a very dynamic environment. Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance.","The company recorded one-time charges of $10 million or $0.02 per share in the quarter, which include the amortization of the value associated with acquired backlog relating to the Casco acquisition completed in the third quarter and also acquisition-related transaction costs. The company also recorded acquisition cost in last year\u2019s fourth quarter of $3 million or $0.01 per share. The acquisition related costs include professional fees, transaction taxes and other external expenses relating to the acquisitions closed in the respective time periods.","Interest expense for the quarter was $20 million compared to $16 million last year due to higher average debt levels resulting from the company\u2019s acquisition and stock buyback programs. From a sequential standpoint, interest expense in the fourth quarter declined about $1 million from Q3 to Q4 and will further decline by another $3 million or so in Q1 2015 due to a reduction in the company\u2019s average effective interest rate. The lower average rate is a result of the new note issuance in September replacing a higher cost note maturity in November and the implementation of a new commercial paper program. Other income in the quarter was $5.2 million, up from $3.9 million last year primarily as a result of higher interest income and higher levels of cash and short-term cash investments.","The company\u2019s effective tax rate in the quarter was 26.4% compared to 26.3% last year both excluding one-time items. For the full year also excluding one-time items the rates were 26.5% and 26.3% in 2014 and 2013 respectively. On an as reported basis the company\u2019s effective tax rate was approximately 26.2% in Q4 2014 and 26.5% for the full year 2014 compared to 26.2% and 24.6% for the respective 2013 time periods. The full year 2013 included the impact of a net income tax benefit of $3.6 million or $0.01 per share relating primarily to the completion of prior year audits. In addition, it also included an income tax benefit of $11 million or $0.03 per share resulting from the reinstatement on January 2, 2013 of certain federal income tax provisions relating primarily to research and development and U.S. taxes on foreign income. Our 2015 guidance incorporates an effective tax rate excluding one-time items of 26.5%.","Net income excluding one-time items was approximately 14% of sales in the quarter and earnings per share also before one-time items increased a strong 19% to $0.63 in Q4. For the full year 2014 EPS excluding one-time items was $2.25, up 17% over last year, an excellent performance. Orders for the quarter were $1.427 billion, up 15% from last year resulting in a book to bill ratio of about 1-to-1.","The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash and we had very strong cash flow in the fourth quarter. Cash flow is $273 million or 140% of net income. For the full year operating cash flow was $881 million and 123% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. The company had good working capital management during the quarter. Inventories stood at $866 million at the end of the year, up 2% from September. Inventory days were 79 days, down one day from both September 2014 and December 2013 levels. Accounts receivable was $1.1 billion at the end of the year, up about 3% from September. Day sales outstanding was 71 days, up one day from September 2014 and December 2013 and accounts payable was $618 million, up about 3% from September and from the days perspective was 57 days, up one day compared to both September and prior December levels.","The strong cash flow from operations along with net proceeds from our commercial paper program of $671 million and $12 million of stock option proceeds were used primarily to purchase $139 million of the company\u2019s stock to fund $46 million of capital expenditures and $50 million of acquisition payments relating to the December acquisition of Goldstar to fund the November maturity of the company\u2019s 4.75, $600 million 5-year notes and to repay $22 million under the company\u2019s revolving credit facility. This resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of about $96 million in the quarter.","During the quarter the company repurchased 2.9 million shares under its January 2013, 20 million share stock buyback program. This completed the authorization under that program and the Board of Directors has authorized a new 2-year, 10 million stock share repurchase program that commences this month.","At the end of the year, cash and short-term investments were $1.33 billion. The majority of which is held outside the U.S. Our total debt stood at $2.67 billion bringing net debt to $1.34 billion. And as we previously disclosed in September of this year, the company established a new $1.5 billion commercial paper program that\u2019s supported by the company\u2019s $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. And at quarter end, the company had issued $671 million in commercial paper under the program. EBITDA in the quarter was $330 million bringing the full year EBITDA to $1.2 billion. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance.","Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends.","Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much, Diana and I\u2019d like to offer my welcome to all of you on the phone and hopefully it\u2019s not too late to wish you as well a Happy New Year here in January. As Diana mentioned, I am going to highlight some of our achievements during the fourth quarter and the full year and then I will spend some time to discuss the trends and our progress across our various served markets. Finally, I will make some comments on our outlook for the first quarter as well as for the full year of 2015.","Turning to the fourth quarter, I think as Diana just reviewed, the fourth quarter was an excellent quarter for the company in virtually all respects. As we exceeded the high-end of our guidance while setting new records in sales and earnings, our revenue increased a very strong 15% from prior year and 5% sequentially reaching the record level of $1.427 billion. And the company similarly booked a record $1.427 billion in orders, which represented a book-to-bill of exactly 1-to-1. Diana also highlighted that we reached in the quarter the highest levels of profitability in the company\u2019s history with our operating margins expanding 50 basis points from prior year to 20.2%, a great achievement by any benchmark.","We are also very pleased that our Board of Directors has approved the 10 million share stock buyback program that we announced today, which follows the completion of our January 2013 program. What I can just say with respect to the fourth quarter and for the year, I am extremely proud of our team. Our results this quarter confirm once again the true value of the discipline as well as the agility of Amphenol\u2019s entrepreneurial organization. We continue to capitalize on the many available opportunities for growth, while also driving superior operating performance.","We also made great progress in our acquisition program in the fourth quarter with the acquisition of Goldstar Electric Systems, which was completed during the month of December. Goldstar is a China-based manufacturer of high technology interconnect assemblies for the industrial heavy equipment industry. And the company has facilities in two important new locations in China and has annual revenues of approximately $40 million. There is no question that the addition of Goldstar strengthens what is already a very robust presence that we have in the China industrial market and provides a great complement to our already fast growing industrial interconnect business.","We are especially pleased that the entire management team of Goldstar has joined Amphenol and I personally look forward to them driving continued growth in the company for many years to come. This acquisition is very consistent with our ongoing successful strategy to acquire complementary companies with strong management, leading technology and an excellent market presence. And as we welcome this outstanding new team to Amphenol, we remain very confident that our successful acquisition program will continue to create value for Amphenol into the future.","I\u2019d like to make a couple of comments just about the full year of 2014. And I think we can say very simply that 2014 was an outstanding year for the company. As we grew strongly while establishing new records in sales and earnings, we expanded our position in the overall market growing sales by 16% to a new record $5.346 billion. And we did that while generating EPS of $2.25, a growth of 17% from prior year and achieving 19.6% operating margins.","We are also very pleased to have created further value with our acquisition program in 2014 with the important acquisitions of Casco and then Goldstar, which we just announced. These fine companies are significant additions to Amphenol, which further expand our position in the automotive, interconnect and sensors market as well as in the industrial interconnect market. It is our consistent focus across Amphenol on growing with the broadening array of customers across the many diversified end markets that has resulted in us strengthening our position across the Board in the electronics industry.","In addition, our entrepreneurial organization has accelerated the development of innovative-interconnect technologies in support of our clear long-term mission which is to be the enabler of the electronics revolution. These developments have allowed Amphenol to capitalize on exciting new markets and thereby have broadened the opportunity for the company for our future growth. So as we close 2014, I can just say that we are confident that we have now built a new platform of strength from which the company can drive even stronger performance into the future.","Now, turning to the trends in our served markets, I just want to comment that once again in the quarter our diversification across these end markets remains one of the greatest assets of the company with no market representing more than 17% of our sales for the full year 2014. The military market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter and 11% of our sales for the full year. Sales in the military market increased 3% from prior year driven by growth in military vehicle communications and airframe applications and grew 2% sequentially. For the full year 2014 our sales were up slightly and that is despite what have been very well reported reductions in overall military spending in many Western countries.","We are pleased to have seen some stabilization that demand environment in particular in the United States defense market, but while we do not expect any significant rebounds in overall spending and while world events continue to create uncertainty around these global spending patterns, we are confident that our position remains strong. The increasing electronic content in military equipment together with our broad program participation and strong positions in high-growth emerging markets have created good platforms for future growth. While we expect a slight moderation of sales going into the first quarter, for the full year 2014 we do anticipate a modest increase in sales from these levels as we benefit from the ramp up of new programs as well as from our new designs on next generation military equipment.","The commercial aerospace market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter as well as for the full year of 2014. Sales increased a very strong 6% from prior year and actually 8% organically as we continued to capitalize on increased demand resulting from higher production levels of next generation jetliners on which we have strong content. Sequentially, our sales grew by 4% from the seasonally lower third quarter. And as we look back at the full year of 2014, our sales grew strongly rising from 2013 by 18% including acquisitions and 10% organically clearly outperforming the overall market for jetliners.","We are very pleased with our continued progress in the commercial air market. As we have taken excellent advantage of the proliferation of new electronics on next generation jetliners which we are enabling with our high-technology interconnect products. Looking forward, we expect sales to essentially remain at roughly these levels in the first quarter, but we continue to have a positive outlook for the commercial air market in 2015 and beyond as production volumes continued to ramp up and as new platforms launch thereby creating an exciting long-term opportunity for Amphenol.","The industrial market represented 16% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 17% of our sales for the full year of 2014, effectively one of our two largest markets in the year. Sales in this market grew by a very strong 35% on a year-over-year basis. And this was driven in particular by growth in the medical, heavy equipment and oil and gas segments together with contributions from our acquisitions that have been completed during the course of the past year. On a sequential basis our sales were slightly lower than prior quarters, demand moderated seasonally in several segments of the industrial market. For the full year of 2014 we are just very pleased with this market where sales grew by an extremely strong 44% as we benefited from the acquisition of advanced sensors as well as strong 14% organic growth in the worldwide industrial market.","We are very pleased with our outstanding progress this year in this market. Our expansion within the many growth segments of the market including medical, heavy equipment, oil and gas as well as factory automation has been complemented by a successful extension into sensors as well as our continued development of high-technology interconnect products. The addition of Goldstar here in the fourth quarter represents yet another step forward in our successful expansion in particular within the high-growth China industrial market. While we have seen some recent slowing in certain segments of the industrial market, including in particular the oil and gas area. Looking ahead, we expect sales to remain stable in the first quarter. And we have continued to look forward to a strong year in the industrial market in 2015 as we benefit from the Goldstar acquisition as well as from our continued progress at diversification to the many exciting segments of the industrial market.","The automotive market represented 17% of our sales in the fourth quarter and represented 15% of our sales for the full year of 2014. Sales increased an excellent and higher than expected 62% from prior year and 24% sequentially. Organic growth in the quarter was a very, very strong 21% year-over-year and 5% sequentially really strong by any measure. This significant year-over-year growth was driven by ongoing ramp-ups of new high technology programs as well as generally higher vehicle production volumes combined with the significant benefits from both the Advanced Sensors and Casco acquisitions that we have completed over the course of last year.","For the full year of 2014, we are very pleased as we have achieved excellent growth of 49% in U.S. dollars and 21% organically for the total of 2014. No question that these results reflect our success in our drive to expand our interconnect and now sensor product offering into new vehicles around the world and we look forward to further capitalizing on the accelerating revolution of automotive electronics in the future. Our expanded product offering now extends to many exciting areas of the market from hybrid and electric drives to safety and security, telematics and infotainment, exhaust management and engine control and transmission and braking, all areas which positioned us strongly for future growth in the automotive market.","For the first quarter, we anticipate a moderate increase in sales compared to fourth quarter and a more than 30% increase in U.S. dollars and 45% increase in local currencies compared to the prior year\u2019s first quarter. For the full year 2015, we expect strong double-digit growth in this market as we realized the benefits of the Casco acquisition as well as of our very successful expansion of the range of automotive electronics into which our interconnect and sensor products are designed.","The mobile devices market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter and 17% of our sales for the full year 2014. Our sales increased by stronger-than-expected 4% from prior year on increased sales of products sold into smartphones and smartphone accessories as well as laptops, which more than offset a reduction in tablet-related sales. Sequentially, we grew a very strong 21% from the third quarter again on increased sales of smartphones and accessories as well as some sequential increase in tablet sales. This was another excellent demonstration of our team\u2019s ability to quickly react and to flex our manufacturing capacity to increase customer demand, no doubt, a critical asset in this very dynamic market.","For the full year 2014, sales increased by 5%, which certainly represented better performance than we had anticipated coming into the second half of the year. We are confident that our highly reactive and agile organization will continue to secure a strong position in the ever dynamic mobile device market and remain encouraged by our excellent technology position across the wide range of new mobile computing platforms. In particular, mobile functionality is being integrated into an ever broader array of devices thereby expanding the growth opportunity for both our interconnect as well as antenna products.","Looking into the first quarter, we do expect a roughly 25% sequential reduction in sales due to normal seasonality combined with the impact from strong ramp-ups of new products in the fourth quarter. Just want to note that this is very similar to the seasonal decline that we experienced coming into the first quarter of this last year 2014. At this point, we expect sales for the full year of 2015 to remain roughly at these 2014 levels as increases in products sold into smartphones and accessories as well as laptops are offset by expected reductions in sales related to tablet computers. Regardless of the overall demand environment though, we remain extremely confident that our dynamic, agile team has positioned us to benefit from any increases in demand that may arise in this exciting market.","The mobile networks market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter and 11% of our sales for the full year and sales grew again strongly from prior year expanding by 13% on growth in products sold both into wireless OEMs as well as direct to wireless service providers. As expected, sales declined sequentially by 19% as operators around the world moderated their spending from their earlier high levels of investment. No question that 2014 was an excellent year for our team working in the mobile networks market as they were able to capitalize on the expanded build-outs around the world growing our sales by a very strong 24% from prior year, all organic.","Our clear outperformance of the overall wireless market this year is a great affirmation of the strength of both our broad-interconnect as well as antenna technologies combined with our excellent position with OEM and operator customers around the world. Based on the latest information we have from those customers and looking out into the first quarter and beyond we do expect a further moderation of sales in the first quarter. And at this time we anticipate a slight reduction in our sales to the mobile networks market for 2015 as operators digest the significant investments that were made in 2014. But regardless, we remain very well positioned in this market due to our broad design and positions on new base station platforms as well as our strong presence with a diverse range of global wireless operators.","The information technology and data comm market represented 16% of our sales in the quarter as well as for the full year of 2014 and very pleased that this market performed better than expected in the fourth quarter as our sales decreased by only a very slight amount from prior year as expected moderations of demand in networking equipment more than offset growth in the storage related products and servers. Our sales increased actually by 3% sequentially on the strengthening of sales of our products incorporated into both networking as well as storage equipment. No question that 2014 was a challenging year in the IT data comm market as the overall market experienced significant dynamics and one could even say disruptions. As a result growth in storage and servers that we did achieve was more than offset by declines in networking equipment sales and thus our total sales declined slightly for the year.","Nevertheless, despite those market dynamics we made tremendous progress this year in our development of advanced high-technology products as well as in our initiative to penetrate the many newly arising Web 2.0 and datacenter customers. Regardless of the many structural changes in this market, all of our IT customers are pushing their equipment to new levels of performance in order to handle the rapid expansion of data, which is driven in particular by new mobile devices and by the continuing spread of video on the Internet as well as by the acceleration of cloud-based computing. While we expect a further seasonal moderation of IT data comm demand in the first quarter, we do anticipate this market to return to growth in 2015. And we are excited by the potential of these new technologies together with our accelerating progress with new datacenter customers.","The broadband market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter and 7% of our sales for the full year 2014. Sales in this market decreased slightly from prior year and by roughly 5% sequentially as domestic MSO build-out activity slowed to the traditional seasonality. For the full year, our sales moderated slightly from 2013 as growth in our new products as well as with non-traditional customers was offset by overall reductions in investments by cable operators, which we believe is in part related to the ongoing consolidation that is occurring in the broadband industry. While we expect demand to remain at these levels in the first quarter, we look forward to some degree of renewed growth in the broadband market in 2015. As operators expand their spending in support of higher-speed data offerings and as we realize the benefits of our expanded offerings of cable and interconnect products.","In summary I just want to say that we are all extremely proud of the company\u2019s excellent growth and record performance in both the fourth quarter and the full year of 2014. And despite the many uncertainties that remain in the global economy, our organization continues to execute extremely well and expand our market position. The company\u2019s superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages leading technology, our broadened and increasing position with customers across the diverse range of end markets in the electronics industry, our presence around the world, a very lean and agile, flexible cost structure as well as an entrepreneurial and dynamic management team that at end of the day makes it happen.","Now turning to our outlook for the first quarter and into 2015 I just want to comment that there no doubt continues to a great deal of geopolitical and market uncertainly around the world, including in particular the increased volatility and significant weakening of certain overseas currencies.","Accordingly and based on a continuation of the current economic environment as well as on constant exchange rates, we now expect in the first quarter and the full year 2015 the following results. For the first quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1.286 billion to $1.326 billion and EPS in the range of $0.55 to $0.57 respectively. This represents a sales increase versus prior year of 3% to 6% in U.S. dollars and 7% to 10% in local currency as well as an EPS increase of 10% to 14% compared to prior year. For the full year 2015, we anticipate sales in the range of $5.493 billion to $5.653 billion as well as EPS in the range of $2.41 to $2.49. For the full year, this represents sales and EPS growth, excluding one-time items, of 3% to 6% and 7% to 11% respectively over 2014 levels. In constant currencies, this guidance represents a year-over-year growth of 6% to 9%.","We are very encouraged by the strong outlook in sales and earnings, especially given the many dynamics in the global economy. And I remain extremely confident in the ability of the outstanding Amphenol management team to build upon these newly established record levels of revenue and EPS and to continue to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability into 2015.","And operator, at this stage, we would be very happy to take any questions that there may be.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And the question-and-answer period will now begin. Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks a lot. Good afternoon guys. Two questions for me. I guess one I think you guys spent a fair bit of time talking about just some of the FX impact in Q1 and in 2015. Is there a way to think about what is the FX impact on your EPS and potentially even free cash flow for the year?","Diana Reardon","Sure. I think if you think about what the potential FX impacts on income are I think you have got two components. One is translation component, which is just the mathematics of converting foreign currency sales into U.S. dollars. And I think we have disclosed what the sales impact of that is. I would tell you that if you wanted to compute that impact, you could probably use an average ROS on those sales. So, it would be about the same percentage on income than it is on sales. Yes, the second potential impact is for a mismatch between selling price and cost structure. And I think that\u2019s one where we have a very active program to manage that risk. And I think we have done a very good job historically of being able to manage that down to a level that has never been material for the business and we don\u2019t expect to see anything different in the current environment with respect to that. So, I think the translation impact is the only one that you would have.","Amit Daryanani","Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. And I guess I get $0.07 to $0.08 impact to EPS based on the return on sales math. I guess, Adam, maybe you could just touch on the M&A environment, your capital allocation in 2015 as you go forward, maybe just touch on your ability or desire to do deals, how big of a deal would you like to do? And this maybe a little na\u00efve, but do you think a declining euro the way it has makes it increase the probability of you guys doing deals in Europe given you have a better currency today than 6 months ago?","Adam Norwitt","Yes, Amit, well, thank you very much for the question. I think what I would just say relative to the overall M&A environment, we continue to feel that we have a very strong position as what we term the acquirer of choice in the industry. We are very pleased with the acquisition that we made here in the fourth quarter of Goldstar just an outstanding company, not located in Europe, but certainly an outstanding company where it is in China. And we continue to see in terms of capital allocation that M&A remains the best return for us on our capital together with new product expansion and then we have obviously the buyback as well as the dividend program that Diana has talked about very often. But relative to M&A, we continued to be very aggressive. We continued to have a very robust pipeline of deals. And I think what we are very pleased with is as we have expanded the company and expanded the kind of scope of the interconnect solution that we are approaching, including everything from connectors to cable assemblies to flex assemblies to antennas as well as now sensors, the universe of opportunities for acquisitions if anything has grown over the last half of a decade for us and that opens up many, many opportunities for us to pursue interesting companies.","Relative to size there is no question that we have the wherewithal from the capital standpoint and the financial strength to do deals of quite significant size and we would not shy away from that. At the same time we have a very simple, but also pretty strict criteria for acquisitions and that has not changed. It starts with management and us looking to find companies that are run by strong managers who want to really succeed beyond where they have succeeded in the past by being part of Amphenol. We look for companies that have outstanding technology and technology that is really complementary to us. And we look for companies that have a complementary market position in an area where we see growth potential. I think size has never been one of those criterias and it continues not to be a criteria, but no doubt with the financial strength that we have created over these years we have probably more capacity to make a bigger acquisition if that was certainly available.","Relative to the declining euro things go up and things go down. And I think you know well having followed the company for many, many years that we are not opportunistic in the sense that when a currency goes down, we immediately change and we hunt for companies in that area to try to get something on the cheap or otherwise, that\u2019s really not the mindset that we approach. We take a very long view to these acquisitions and we have a pipeline of acquisitions that is made up of companies in every geography around the world. And certainly we will continue to pursue them regardless of where the currency rates have moved in a given day.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes. Thank you. Adam a question on the sensor market and as you bring that business into the fold, just curious kind of the opportunity set that you are seeing from a product development and design standpoint with your customers, if you can give us any insight into that?","Adam Norwitt","Yes. Well, thank you very much Craig. It\u2019s just really exciting I mean here we are in a roughly 13 months after having acquired the Advanced Sensors business, 13 months and 3 days to be exact and we continue to just have positive surprises, I would say every month, every quarter almost every week in terms of validating our original intention to get into the sensors market. How would I describe that, I mean I said early on that we were very excited by the sensor market in particular because we saw a great combination of the technology of interconnect and sensors that the value of a sensor comes not just from that sensor element but rather from that total package that you are selling to customers and very frequently that is an interconnect package.","That was obviously we said that at the day when we bought the company and I can tell you that now 13 months later knowing a lot more than we knew 13 months ago, no question that that has been validated. When we go to customers, there is no doubt about it. There is a positive reception to \u2013 by the customers to the idea that we can bring to those meetings an engineer who gets the sensor, who gets the underlying technology of the sensing element together with an engineer who gets how to connect that into the system, because at the end of the day you can have the best element in the world, but if it doesn\u2019t connect into the system, it doesn\u2019t matter. It just won\u2019t work. And I think that is a challenge that our customers have wrestled with for many, many years. And again that has just been validated time and again as I visited customers and as I have talked to our team and those in and out of our team met customers and otherwise that combination of the interconnect together with the sensor is a very, very compelling proposition for our customers.","So I think as it relates to the product development, we have seen lot of activities between our organization pre-acquisition the interconnect engineering teams together with the sensing engineering teams that came with Advanced Sensors and then later Casco. Does that mean that you flip a switch and the sales go up by a precipitous amount in a moment, of course that doesn\u2019t mean that, because there is the lead time to designing those products. You are working in many cases on very long cycle, harsh environment programs in either the automotive or the industrial market, medical, heavy equipment and places like that. So these aren\u2019t just immediate kind of switches that you can flip, but at the end of the day, there is no doubt that there is a positive momentum behind that and that we see great opportunities in the future to leverage the sensors together with the connectors.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. Thanks. And as my follow-up for Diana, appreciate the color and context around FX, any commentary on metal prices, particularly copper with the decline if that\u2019s a little bit of help or above and beyond that any kind of puts and takes to below the line-out margins as you think through 2015?","Diana Reardon","Yes. Relative I mean to the contributors to margin and commodity prices and oil and this kind of thing, I mean, I think as we have said before, there are many contributors to margin and it\u2019s never easy to single out specific items, but certainly in addition to strong sales growth and good operational execution, a more supportive commodity environment normally is a positive certainly in product areas, where metals or certain plastics or even transportation costs can be particularly important. But the way that we look at this really the ultimate impact on margin depends largely on the balance between input cost and pricing and that balance tends really to be dependent upon the perceptions of demand levels.","And I would say that right now given the current extreme market volatility whether you talk about currencies or commodities or oil economic growth, I mean, it really prevents a bit of a challenge in terms of \u2013 for some markets in terms of establishing what that direction and what that demand is. And so we really right now wouldn\u2019t say that we see any particular abnormal advantage or tailwind from a margin perspective on a consolidated basis relative to any of these trends from a commodity standpoint. But I think also as we have said in response to this question in the past, you can be certainly assured that our management team is going to do the best to capture and keep any advantage that does present itself in the marketplace from commodities, oil or anything else that comes along.","Operator","Your next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS. You may ask your question.","Amitabh Passi","Hi, thank you guys. I had a question and a follow-up. Maybe this is a bit of a finer point and a subtle point, Adam, but I was curious if I look at your first quarter 2015 guidance, it seems like much of the impact is seasonal in some of your markets like mobile devices, concerns around FX. I am just curious are you sensing maybe an increasing level of caution across the Board in terms of order patterns or maybe lead times or are orders being pushed out? I am just wondering if there is a sense of caution in terms of the overall demand environment or do you think again it\u2019s around FX and just maybe seasonality?","Adam Norwitt","Yes, thank you very much, Amitabh. I think that as we look into the first quarter, one thing I will say is the whole world there is a sense of uncertainty. I think that has not been a change. I mean, every quarter there seems to be something new about which the TVs can speak and the newspapers can write, but there is no doubt that there is a lot of uncertainty in the world today. I think as we look at our guidance, I think you correctly characterized that there are some seasonal effects. There is obviously the impact of currency, which is a very dramatic volatility.","And as Diana mentioned, you can\u2019t even look at that currency in a vacuum. It is reflective of some overall dynamic going on in the worldwide market. I think there are also some specific markets, things, a market like, for example, a mobile infrastructure, whereas I mentioned we don\u2019t expect that market to grow this year after having a fabulous growth in 2014, a little bit because operators are digesting that which they built over the course of the recent quarters here. So, I think it is largely seasonality. At the same time, there is no doubt about it, a general sense of uncertainty. I would not point though that there has been any significant pullbacks of orders. There have not been any cancellations or pullouts or some of those more sort of short-term things that one would look at as the sign of a kind of an immediate impending doom. There is certainly none of that that we have seen.","Amitabh Passi","Excellent. And then just as a follow-up, I guess more specifically on the IT datacom segment, you spoke about returning to growth this year. It looks like in 2014 storage might have been a bit better than networking. So, just wanted to understand what drives growth this year? Are all your end markets storage servers, networking performing better? Are you getting greater traction with some of the web scale players? Just any help you can give in terms of the growth drivers?","Adam Norwitt","Sure. I mean, I think I mentioned in my early remarks that this has been a very challenging market, in particular, because of the significant structural changes that have happened in that market. And you have really what you know very well and better than I through your coverage of that space, a true disruption that has happened and a shifting of the balance of power in that and you see that as the OEMs release their results some of which have come out just in the 24 hours or 48 hours. And what we have done in that time and thank goodness we have the agility and the nimble organization to do so. It\u2019s a very rapidly redeploy our resources towards those web centric and cloud computing type companies towards the ODM manufacturers, towards the direct datacenter market. And that\u2019s \u2013 those are efforts that we have really been accelerating over the course of the last year and which we would expect to pay more significant dividends going ahead.","As I look at those groups servers, storage and networking, I don\u2019t think that we see a kind of a different shape to those going into this year. There is no doubt that in 2014 networking was the real drag on the performance, I mean that networking business was down significantly compared to a server and storage business that we are actually up on a full year basis. I think going into this year, we wouldn\u2019t expect that to be so much of a differential between those spaces. But again who knows to be honest, because that is the space where there is more change to come, no question you will see new players arrives and old players disappear and you will see further shift in the balance of who is spending what money. But what will not change and that\u2019s very clear is that data will continue to grow exponentially and the desire to process that data and in fact the need to process that data. This is not going to abate. It\u2019s a question of hunting down who is ultimately doing it. And in that case, I bet on a nimble organization like ours more than any other to go in and ferret that out and establish where those new buying patterns are happening.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. You may ask your question.","Matt Sheerin","Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon and happy New Year.","Adam Norwitt","Happy New Year.","Matt Sheerin","Thanks. A question to Adam regarding the GE sensor business, you talked about the cross-selling opportunities and obviously the opportunities within sensors, from an operating perspective, I know the margins there were below Amphenol\u2019s margins, what kind of progress have you made and how much is left?","Adam Norwitt","Yes. I think we would say that we have made very good progress there. If you look I mean that\u2019s not the only factor. We have had a lot of great execution in driving our margins up quarter-to-quarter over the course of this year. But very clearly we did talk about it in the first quarter last year that the kind of dilutive effect of the lower than average margins of the Advanced Sensors business did pull down our margins in the first quarter. I think the fact that we have brought those margins back up and now in the last quarter 50 basis points higher than before we acquired the Advanced Sensors business is a reflection of the great execution of our total team as well as some impact from improvement in Advanced Sensors. No one has ever done in Amphenol though. So there will be much room to go.","Matt Sheerin","Got it. And regarding your commentary on oil and gas market being softer, which obviously makes sense, how big a business is that for you relative to your industrial exposure and are you just seeing backlog or bookings start to fall going into the year?","Adam Norwitt","Look I mean the beauty of our industrial business and very much like total Amphenol is we have a very, very broad industrial business and there is not any segment across our industrial business which dominates that space. And while it\u2019s true that oil and gas has been one of the helpful drivers and that it won\u2019t be a help going into this year, it is still a market that we continued to believe will have strong performance as I mentioned in my early remarks. So look, there is no question when the price of oil drops by more than half people are going to drill less, they are going hunt less and they are going to explore less and they are going to ultimately use less equipment and those equipment makers are going to use less connectors in making that smaller amount of equipment, so that is what it is.","Our team will react very well. We have a very broad presence again in many areas of the energy market and that\u2019s not even just confined to oil and gas, it includes alternative energy. But you can rest assured that those individuals in the company who are in that space who have seen no doubt about it some pullbacks in order volumes, they are taking the appropriate Amphenol like reactions in terms of measuring their resources and adjusting their resources accordingly. While we reallocate resources to the high growth opportunities that still remain across the industrial market.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Mark Delaney","Good afternoon and thanks very much for letting me ask a question. I was hoping if you could talk first on the M&A situation and have you see any change in the valuations and the level of competitive activity for any of your competitors are trying to bid for some of the same customers that you are and is that impacting the valuations that you are able to get?","Adam Norwitt","Yes. I commented earlier that we still feel very positive about the M&A environment and there is no doubt about that. I mean, look multiples go up and multiples go down. We tend not to sort of chase market multiples. We tend to develop long-term relationships with companies. And then ultimately if we develop mutually a trust between us, we are usually able to find a fair price that satisfies both sides. And I think that\u2019s been our approach in acquisitions. We are not a kind of tactical deal-based acquisition company. We are very much a long-term view towards acquisitions. There are certainly lots of companies in our space and in other spaces related to our space. We want to make lots of acquisitions. And they are going to buy some companies and we are not going to buy some companies, but that\u2019s no change. I mean, that has been the case for a decade and a half across this industry. But over the course of that time period, we have managed to buy somewhere around 70 companies and we have acquired 12 companies just in the last 3 years as the equity markets have expanded and multiples have expanded. And we have continued to still be able to find good companies for fair prices. I don\u2019t say it\u2019s cheap. We are not trying to get cheap prices, but we are getting fair prices and excellent companies. And I think we will continue to find good opportunities to continue on that path.","Mark Delaney","Understood. And then you also mentioned the expansion of the buyback program in your prepared remarks, if you could just help us understand how you plan on implementing the buyback?","Diana Reardon","Sure. I mean, we implement the buyback program as we always have done in the past really each quarter we take a look at a very balanced look at what our acquisition program looks like and we then make the decision on that basis as to how much additional capital it makes sense to deploy. If you go back and look at last year, if you look at the last 5 years, you know what, the results of that has been that about half of the free cash flow of the company has gone back to shareholders in the form either of dividends or stock buybacks. And so if one wanted some sort of proxy, one could use that historical pattern, I would just say that, that we will and we do I think as Adam said before, we prioritized the acquisition program in terms of use of the company\u2019s financial strength, because we really believe that, that provides the best long-term return for the company and for the shareholders, but other than that, if you wanted to use an historical pattern for a proxy of what the company would do with a stock buyback program, I would think that will be fine.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research. You may ask your question.","Steven Fox","Thanks. Good afternoon. Two questions for me. Adam, first off on the auto market outlook you discussed for 2015 you mentioned strong double-digit growth. I wasn\u2019t sure what that meant from an organic standpoint versus say how fast you are going to grow over global vehicle production? And then you did mention a bunch of market extensions there, I don\u2019t know if you could highlight one or two that are driving that? And then just real quick on tablets declining this year, is that a function of unit demand for tablets, market share shifts that your customers or with your products or just any design changes that is impacting you? A little color there would help? Thanks.","Adam Norwitt","Sure. Well, thanks very much, Steve. I think with your first part on the auto market, we do have still a very positive outlook for that market and we have just made outstanding progress. Our whole organization who works in that space, I just can\u2019t applaud them enough for what they have achieved here over the course of the last 5 years in terms of expanding our product offering and getting really positioned on high technology complex interconnect systems that are enabling next-generation electronics in cars. And so as we look going into next year and I mentioned we have strong double-digit outlook, we have also a very strong outlook organically in that space. And I don\u2019t know what the latest numbers are for car expectations, I know you wrote that in the report, but I am sorry, but I forget exactly the number you said, but I know maybe that\u2019s a low single-digit or so outlook for car volumes and we would certainly expect our business to perform significantly above those levels on an organic basis as a result of these excellent design-ins we have on really long-term next-generation systems.","Relative to the mobile devices market, I did mention that we expect growth in smartphones and related accessories together with our laptops being offset by some reduction in tablets. I think that reduction in tablets is a combination what is predominantly driven by just unit volume expectations in the tablet space, where I think there has been \u2013 that\u2019s been widely reported of some of the unit volumes that go. We talked I think a number of quarters ago about some content reductions in the tablet space. And while there maybe some impact from that I think the broader impact comes really from the reduction in units of tablets.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. You may ask your question.","Shawn Harrison","Hi. Good afternoon. Two questions\u2026","Adam Norwitt","Good afternoon. Happy New Year, Shawn.","Shawn Harrison","Thanks Adam. Two questions, but the first on mobile networks is there anyway with the weakness you are anticipating for 2015 if you can maybe give some geographic insights and maybe if you are seeing are region up versus other regions down. And then the second Diana I just wanted to confirm I think last time on the call you said you are targeting CapEx for this year around 3% to 3.5% of sales, just wondering if that number holds true?","Adam Norwitt","Well, thanks very much Shawn. I think it\u2019s a little too early to say what region is going to perform at what level in the mobile networks market going forward. I think what we are very pleased with here in 2014 is that all the regions Asia, North America and Europe all grew in double digits. I think that growth was strongest in Asia, there is no question. But we had also very, very strong growth in Europe and excellent growth in North America as well. So looking at this year on the basis of our expectations that some of these operators are going to be taking a little time to digest their investments, I don\u2019t know that that would be so much differential across the regions, but it\u2019s early to say in that market.","Diana Reardon","And from a CapEx standpoint that still would hold true Shawn. It would be about 3%, 3.5% of sales that would be down from 2014 levels where we were funding some new buildings and so forth that won\u2019t repeat in 2015.","Shawn Harrison","Thanks a lot.","Adam Norwitt","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. You may ask your question.","Jim Suva","Thank you and Adam and Diana congratulations to you and your team there at Amphenol for great results and outlook.","Adam Norwitt","Thank you, Jim.","Jim Suva","I have one question for Adam and one question for Diana and they are pretty unrelated, but Adam when we talked about the integration of your acquisitions such as the GE sensor market and things like that and great progress there. But I have to wonder about on the cross-selling opportunity, is that still more to come in the future and the reason why I ask it a lot of designs for connectors and interconnect with sensors are designed in from a product inception and necessarily don\u2019t rule out immediately to say hey stop using this competitor\u2019s connector and start using Amphenol\u2019s connectors. So I guess the question Adam is that still more in the future to come and if so does that typically take and I guess this is your first real sensor company acquisition, do you envision that kind of more like a 2 to 3 year down the road of being able to designing more Amphenol content or when do you expect that to happen, is there still more upside.","And one for Diana on the question a little follow-up on the raw materials, if I remember correctly I think the at the coaxial business has a significantly more percent wise of say copper and plastic\/petroleum-based products and if so can you walk us through about the timing of when raw materials could potentially help your company such as I believe you would have to buy the materials, procure it and put it together then sell it, so maybe there is a little bit of a lagging impact to raw materials going lower to your margins, so maybe a couple of quarters down the road. And do you typically give back like half and keep half the savings in general or how should we think about that? Thank you.","Diana Reardon","Jim maybe I will go first. I don\u2019t know that I would give a very different answer on the cable business than I gave on the interconnect business. I think that the going way, way back in the cable business when we had no sort of ancillary products and we had a lot of hard-line cable there was one commodity in particular that was certainly a dominant piece of the puzzle there. I would say now the business is a little more diverse from a product standpoint to start with and I think you have that same relationship that I talked about between pricing and cost structure. And so I wouldn\u2019t say that in that business we necessarily see a significant tailwind at this point. I would reiterate though that if we certainly get the opportunity for significant savings that \u2013 and get the opportunity from a demand standpoint to keep those we certainly are quite good at doing that. We have a very good profitability track record and then we will certainly make every effort to get the most bang for the buck there. But we really just don\u2019t see in either segment at this point a significant benefit coming through purely because of commodity prices.","Adam Norwitt","Yes. And Jim relative to your first question on the integration and the various opportunities for cross-selling, I mean, I would just say once again that we have \u2013 there is tremendous activity across the company of getting engineers together with engineers, getting salespeople together with salespeople and working with customers. But you correctly point out that there is a time cycle. There is a cycle to program development. It is not always that you have to be there on the first day of conception of something, because in fact, it\u2019s not always at that time when the connectors or the sensors are designed in. And I think there is one additional thing. As you look in industrial and in particular in automotive, there is an advent now of more what I would call mid-cycle upgrades and that comes from a very simple dynamic. It is the fact that all of us are used now to upgrading our personal technology on a very frequent basis.","I mean, we are getting a new phone every 6 months. My kids would prefer to have one every 3 months I think, but they are getting it every year or two and very unhappy because of it, but we have a human need to upgrade technology, because there is such a rapid pace of improvement of the functionality of that technology. The automakers, the industrial equipment makers, they have not been blind to this dynamic. And thus you are starting to see more and more potential for what I would call non-mission critical mid-cycle upgrades. We saw that very clearly in things like the lighting. We made a wonderful acquisition several years ago of a company in automotive lighting. And immediately, what we saw was changing the lights much more frequently than they are changing the body types. It\u2019s called the cosmetic upgrade. They are doing the same things with some of these electronic systems.","So, putting in a new temperature sensing system of some sort, putting in some sort of new telematic system, whenever that is, there are these mid-cycle upgrades which have the potential to shorten the lifecycle that is there. I can tell you I was just a couple of weeks ago in Las Vegas at this Consumer Electronics Show, which I in many ways wouldn\u2019t wish on my worst enemy because you wear through at least a pair of shoes and you bump into a lot of people over the course of a few hours. But what was amazing is just to see the proliferation in the automotive industry of the electronics. I mean, that show is becoming an automotive show, where it used to be a computer show years ago. And I think that\u2019s another reflection of this expansion of electronics that you see of things that are moving faster than just new body types and new engine types and new transmissions that used to be the kind of gating feature on these long lifecycles. So, I think it\u2019s true that the cross-selling will take time. It always takes time regardless, because we are not in the business of kind of throwing these new companies into chaos. We let them run their company, the day they come into Amphenol. We don\u2019t want things to change. And from that respect, we want the same people to be running that business and performing, but then we slowly opened doors of opportunity to them both collaborating with their peers and opening doors into customers where they wouldn\u2019t otherwise have had a presence and therein lies the long-term value that we can create with these acquisitions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. You may ask your question.","William Stein","Thanks. I\u2019d like to dig into the very good operating margin performance for a second. You have long had 20% aggregate operating margin sort of bogey, I think this is the second time you have exceeded it and you have had 25% fall through target and you had very good fall through in the quarter. I am wondering if either owing to your growing revenue in sensors and more integrated products, Adam, that you discussed you talked about flex circuits and other sort of more integrated products, I am wondering if that\u2019s potentially resulting in the ability to deliver higher still either fall through or aggregate operating margins?","Adam Norwitt","No, I mean, maybe I will make some comment briefly and then let Diana also address this. I think that is not really the main driver. I mean, we believe that there is good product \u2013 there is good profit opportunities across all of the spaces that we participate in. And I think those areas that you point out really open up great opportunities for profitable growth for the company and expansion.","Diana Reardon","Sure. I mean, I think that we have done a great job in 2014 in terms of expansion and you referred to that. I think we have also guided in 2015 on a year-over-year basis to strong margin expansion. And I think that the keys to that really are the same as they have always been. It\u2019s a focus on technology and it\u2019s a culture of accountability, attention to detail from a cost standpoint and the company\u2019s entrepreneurial structure. I think as Adam said that applies across the board to everything that we do that doesn\u2019t apply more or less to one technology or the other. I think that if you look at the 2015 guidance and you look at the earnings per share growth know that we have guided. If you just take the high end as an example, we have got a 6% sales growth from the high end and we have got in 11% earnings per share growth.","And so if you look at the diversified group of EPS growth drivers that are really contributing to that performance I think this is extremely strong guidance for the year. And you have got organic sales growth in multiple markets that drives that. You have got margin expansion that I talked about with our margins going from about 19.6% to 20% next year. We have got the contribution from our acquisitions program that Adam talked about at length. We have got the contribution from the stock buyback program and we have got a lower effective interest rate from the refinancing actions that we took in 2014. So I think that when we look at the guidance we have given in 2015, we don\u2019t see any need to set any other goals and I think these are great goals. This is a very strong performance both from an operating margin perspective and from a total EPS growth standpoint. And I think as a team we certainly will feel very, very good about the achievements of those goals as we lay them out for 2015.","William Stein","Great, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Adam Norwitt","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes. Thanks a lot. Adam could you comment a little bit about the diversification within mobile devices given the flat guidance for the year particularly if you are participating with some of the newer players that seem to be gaining share rapidly in the emerging smartphone market? Thanks.","Adam Norwitt","Sure. I think I discussed earlier about the product diversification. And I think I will just remind you that we have a strong position really across the board with customers and in every space in the mobile devices markets. I think that the \u2013 our position is not totally different from the various market share positions of the various customers that are out there and has always been the case. And I think what we have been very successful over the years is regardless of who the winners are and who the losers are we have managed over very long-term to build our business successfully. And we remain committed to continuing that trend going forward. There is no question that there have been some very nice new companies who have come about and we have participated with many if not all of those companies in a variety of fashions both with our interconnect as well as our antenna products. And we will continue to do so. And I think as you look into this coming year, it remains a market that is very hard market to predict. It remains the market where the winners of yesterday are not the winners of today. And the winners of today may not be the winners of tomorrow. But regardless we will remain committed to staying present with all of those.","The whole underlying success that we have had is really based on a cultural difference of our organization who works in mobile devices, who play \u2013 who effectively works across these many different customers in these many different products in a way that reflects just a tremendous agility ducking and dodging as things come your way. I mean it is not an easy market for them, but they do a fabulous, fabulous job by remaining quick, by getting quickly on to the right programs and effectively all the programs. But ultimately the outlook that we have given is one that is reflective of the fact that it is a difficult market to predict and one where if as I said there are further opportunities for growth, I am sure our organization will be the first to really pounce upon those and execute well.","Wamsi Mohan","Thanks Adam. And a quick one for Diana if I could just a follow-up on your comments from the previous question, your 2015 guidance the midpoint incremental margins are well north of 30%. And when you look at the realized sort of incremental margins across the last several quarters they have very strong north of 20% and 22.5% range for most of the time and if you look over the last several years that\u2019s being true too, so what do you think is really changing within sort of that is driving the incremental almost 10 points more of incremental margin within the guidance range?","Diana Reardon","We don\u2019t see 10 points more of incremental margin when we look at the guidance we see conversion margins as we call them that are a little above 25, but certainly not 30. So, I guess I don\u2019t have exactly the same math that you have. It is true that we had some quarters in 2014 to your point that we are in excess of 30. And I think that when we talk through those quarters and those really were Q2 and Q3. We had a certainly strong operating execution with some contribution from some of the acquisitions coming up to speed. And I think as I said before, it\u2019s hard to pinpoint so precisely every single element that contributes to enhanced operating income margins. But I think that we feel certainly very comfortable with the guidance that we have given, it does include as I said before an expansion in ROS for the year and does have conversion margins that are I would say slightly higher than our 25% goal, but not materially different. And we continue to go along and think that, that is the appropriate goal for the company. We always try to do more, try to do better if we can, but I think we will feel quite good at the end of the day when we achieve these 2015 goals.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question.","Brian White","Great. Just on the March quarter outlook at the midpoint, it looks like sales fall 8% sequentially, I know historically the last I think 5 years it\u2019s been flat on average. So, what is really driving the seasonality that seems a little more magnified in this March quarter?","Diana Reardon","Yes. The 5 years, I am not sure what acquisition impacts you have in there. I think if you look from an organic standpoint, the first quarter tends to be down unless you have a particular market that is doing something unusual. I mean, if you would look at last year\u2019s first quarter as an example, we did still have a sequential decline, but in that particular quarter as an example, the mobile network market had a big sequential upswing. So, you do have some markets that from time-to-time behave unusually in the first quarter, but I think as far as we are concerned, our normal range is down 4%, 5% kind of range. Maybe this is a percent more. At the high end of guidance, it\u2019s a couple of percent more. At the low end of guidance, I guess, it depends upon which you want to look at, but I don\u2019t think we feel that this is an unusual first quarter from a seasonality perspective.","Brian White","Okay. Because the only first quarter I see that\u2019s weaker was first quarter of \u201809, which was down 13%. In the history, I never see a quarter go down more than that.","Diana Reardon","Yes. I mean, sometimes we have acquisitions, Brian, that come in, in the first quarter that muck up the comparisons. I mean, you kind of need to look at the organic numbers. And I would just off the top of my head, I don\u2019t know all the stats in front of me, but our sales tend to be down a few percent in the first quarter on an organic basis.","Brian White","Okay. And then Adam, when we think about this sensor market, do you feel like you have all the tools in that market that you would like, you can service all the verticals that you would like or what percent of the way through are you? It sounds like at a big opportunity it\u2019s exciting and it\u2019s new?","Adam Norwitt","Yes. I know it is a big opportunity, it\u2019s exciting and it\u2019s new, though it is all very true, but do we have all the kind of tools? I mean, I would say, do we have all of the products to offer all the attractive markets? And the answer is absolutely not. I think when we acquired the GE Advanced Sensors business, we are very excited by one thing in particular which was it was a very diversified company, but it was very diversified, but it was certainly not everything. And so it was a great place to start the Advanced Sensors, because it gave us the presence across the automotive and industrial market. Within the industrial market, it gave us the presence in a variety of areas, heavy equipment, medical, HVAC, in smart buildings and things like that. It gave us also an access into pressure and temperature, gas and moisture.","And then the addition of Casco added to our automotive sensor offering with rain sensing and light as well as additional temperature sensing, but no question. I mean, we are far, far from having what I would call a comprehensive sensor portfolio. And that\u2019s the great opportunity. Because the opportunity comes both in our organic developments of new products which our teams are certainly doing and are being driven and supported to do much more than they were under the umbrella of a big industrial conglomerate. And at the same time, we have a robust pipeline of sensor acquisitions, which over the coming years and half decades and decades ahead, we will pursue with the same level of aggression and effectiveness that we have done in the interconnect market. And we don\u2019t today have every connector either. It\u2019s a big beautiful diversified market where we still see great opportunities for expansion. And I think that\u2019s doubly true with the sensors.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Mike Wood with Macquarie Securities Group. You may ask your question.","Ryan Hunter","This is actually Ryan Hunter on for Mike. And I just have a few quick questions. First in regards to the Goldstar acquisition, is this more opportunistic due to declines in China heavy equipment market over the past few years or a technology acquisition and the synergies between \u2013 with your auto and current industrial business?","Adam Norwitt","Yes. I think this was not opportunistic, I mean we have known the company for a very long time. We have a great sense of understanding and also optimism relative to the China industrial market and its totality. And I think we see great opportunities for continued expansion with that company. It\u2019s a fabulous, fabulous company I mean really you walk into their factory you don\u2019t feel like you are out in the middle of nowhere China which is kind of where their operations are. You feel like you are in really a world class manufacturing operation and thus the customers who want to have that same world class support they really flock to Goldstar. And I think the great \u2013 there is a great opportunity domestically in China, but there is an equal and attractive opportunity servicing customers around the world with their low cost base and so those are \u2013 it\u2019s a are very, very exciting company and certainly far from opportunistic in our case.","Ryan Hunter","Cool and we have seen obviously a recent drop in input costs like gold and copper and can you guys discuss what tailwinds that you have embedded in your fiscal year \u201915 guidance from price costs and what end market would be the biggest beneficiaries?","Adam Norwitt","I think Diana already mentioned a lot about the fact that we see that what\u2019s important is not necessarily the input costs but the balance of input costs in the end market environment. And I think as she mentioned very well, we will no doubt seize on whatever opportunity comes from those input costs, but it is not just an automatic, there is not just an automatic flow through and if the market environment \u2013 if those input costs are reflective of an overall market environment which is not as robust then you don\u2019t tend to be able to just put everything into one\u2019s pocket.","Adam Norwitt","Very good. Well, I think this was the last question and we truly appreciate all of your attention and support and look forward to seeing you or hearing from you at least in three months from now. Happy New Year again and we will talk to you soon.","Diana Reardon","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for attending today\u2019s conference. And have a nice day."],"2089":["Amphenol (NYSE:APH) Q2 2012 Earnings Call July 18, 2012  1:00 PM ET","Executives","Diana G.

[Operator Instructions] At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Ms. Diana Reardon. Ma'am, you may begin.","Diana G. Reardon","Thank you, and good afternoon. My name is Diana Reardon, and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we'd like to welcome you all to our second quarter call.","Q2 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will then give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question-and-answer session.","The company closed Q2, achieving new records in sales and earnings per share. Sales were $1,061,000,000 and EPS was $0.86, both beating the high end of the company's guidance. Sales were up 4% in U.S. dollars and 6% in local currencies compared to Q2 of 2011. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency impacts, sales in Q2 2012 were up 2% versus last year. From a sequential perspective, sales were up 8% in U.S. dollars and a strong 7% organically from Q1 of 2012.","Breaking down sales into our 2 major components, our Cable business, which comprised 7% of our sales, was up 2% from last year and up 3% from last quarter. The Interconnect business, which comprised 93% of our sales, was up 4% from last year and 9%, sequentially. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.","Operating income for the quarter was $206 million compared to a prior year income number of $215 million as reported, and $197 million excluding one-time items. Operating income in 2011 included income of approximately $18 million relating to an adjustment to reduce a previously recorded contingent payment obligation for 2010 U.S.-based acquisition.","Operating margin was 19.4% in Q2, which is up from 18.9% in Q1, a strong sequential conversion margin of approximately 26% from Q1. The Q2 ROS level of 19.4% is equal to the Q2 2011 ROS, excluding the impact of one-time items.","Operating income in both years is net of stock option expense of $8 million in the 2012 quarter and $7 million in the 2011 quarter, about 0.7% of sales for both time periods.","From a segment perspective, in the Cable business, margins were 13.8%, up from 12.8% last year. The margin improvement relates primarily to lower relative material cost. From a sequential standpoint, Cable margins declined from 14.5% in Q1, primarily as a result of a less favorable pricing environment and product mix. In the Interconnect business, margins were 21.6%, equal to last year, and up from 21% last quarter. The Interconnect operating margin improvement from last quarter primarily reflects the positive impacts of higher volume and cost reduction actions. We are very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement in the quarter.","2012 continues to be a more balanced operating environment from a cost inflation and demand perspective. And in that environment, the management team has achieved strong sequential improvement in operating margins, both in Q1 and Q2, and remains fully committed to further margin expansion as business volumes grow. We continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and culture of cost control allows us to react in a fast and flexible manner, thereby constantly adjusting the business to maximize profitability in what clearly continues to be a very dynamic environment.","Interest expense for the quarter was $15.1 million compared to $11.4 million last year, reflecting higher average debt levels from the company stock buyback program and the higher interest expense associated with the company's January senior note offering.","Other income was $2.6 million, up from $2.1 million, primarily as a result of higher interest income and higher levels of cash and short-term cash investments.","Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 26.8%, compared to approximately the same rate in the second quarter of last year, excluding the impact of one-time items. For the full year 2011, excluding the one-time items, the company's effective tax rate was also 26.8%, and we currently expect a similar rate in 2012.","Net income was approximately 13% of sales in Q2, and EPS grew 9% over last year, excluding one-time items, a very strong performance.","Orders in the quarter were $1,052,000,000 resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 0.99:1. In addition, in the second quarter, the company completed the acquisition of Deutgen Group, a German manufacturer of high-technology, precision injection-molded components primarily for automotive applications with annual sales of about $25 million.","The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $127 million. For the 6 months, operating cash flow was $292 million or 109% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income.","From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $675 million at the end of June, up 3% over the March quarter. Inventory days declined 5 days to 83 days and are now comparable with prior year levels and back to the low end of the company's historical range. We're very pleased with the reduction in inventory days in the quarter. Accounts receivable was $840 million and days sales outstanding increased 1 day to 71 days at the end of the quarter. Accounts payable was $432 million and, from a day's perspective, was down 1 day at 53 days from March. Overall, we're very pleased with the company's working capital achievement in the quarter.","The cash flow from operations of $127 million, along with borrowings under the company's revolving credit and receivables facilities of $149 million and proceeds and related tax benefits from option exercises of $18 million, were used primarily for capital expenditures of $32 million, the purchase of 2.1 million shares of the company's stock for $119 million, payments of $82 million related -- relating to acquisitions, including the acquisitions of Nelson-Dunn and Deutgen, dividend payments of $17 million and an increase in cash and cash investments of $37 million in the quarter.","The company has approximately 3 million shares remaining under its 20 million share buyback program that expires in January 2014.","At the end of the quarter, cash and short-term investments were $780 million, the majority of which is held outside of the U.S.","Total debt for the company was $1.5 billion, bringing net debt to approximately $764 million at the end of June. At quarter end, borrowings and availability under the company's revolving credit facility were $348 million and $652 million, respectively. And our leverage and interest coverage ratios remain very strong at 1.6x and 19x, respectively.","EBITDA in the quarter was approximately $249 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter.","Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends.","R. Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much, Diana, and I'd like to add my welcome to all of you here today on the phone. I'm going to spend a few moments to highlight some of our second quarter achievements that Diana just reviewed, then I'll discuss our trends and our progress in our served markets. And then finally, I'll make some comments on our outlook for the third quarter and the full year, leaving time for some questions at the end.","We're very excited to report record orders, sales and earnings in the second quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance despite ongoing uncertainties in the global marketplace. Our revenues in the quarter increased 4% from prior year and 8%, sequentially, achieving a new sales record for the company of $1,061,000,000. And as Diana mentioned, orders have also reached a new record of $1,052,000,000, representing a book-to-bill of just under 1:1.","We find it especially rewarding that our intense focus on managing all elements of profitability have led to further expansion of our operating margins to 19.4% return on sales. I'm very proud of the agile entrepreneurial Amphenol organization, all of whom are capitalizing on the opportunities that are being created by the ongoing electronics revolution while at the same time demonstrating the strength and discipline necessary to drive strong operating performance in any economic environment.","In addition, we're very pleased that our successful acquisition program continued in the second quarter. As Diana mentioned, in June, we completed the acquisition of the Deutgen Group, a German-based manufacturer of precision-molded components for the automotive market. This acquisition, with annual sales of approximately $25 million, builds upon our expanded offering of products to the automotive market and in particular, it enhances our capabilities in advanced molding technologies for this important sector. The acquisition is consistent with our ongoing and long-term strategy of acquiring complementary companies with strong management, leading technology and, in particular, an excellent market presence. As we welcome this excellent new team to Amphenol, we remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create significant value for Amphenol in the future.","Turning to the trends and our progress in our served markets. I think once again, our results in the second quarter confirmed that Amphenol's end market diversification is a tremendous asset for the company, especially given the widely reported uncertainties in many of the world's economies.","Turning first to the Military market. That market represented 14% of our sales in the quarter. And sales declined by 9% from prior year on continued conservatism by defense customers, driven in particular by the ongoing budget uncertainties in certain western countries. On a sequential basis, sales were up slightly as our new technology solutions offset the impact of an overall moderation in spending. In the third quarter, we expect demand in the military market to show some typical seasonal declines. Nevertheless, while there remains uncertainty in many of the defense budgets in developed economies, we continue to make progress in creating new high-technology solutions for advanced military electronics, and we're especially encouraged to be seeing continued indications of investments in these new electronics by the military.","The Commercial Aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter, and sales continued to increase strongly from prior year, growing by 14%. Sales were slightly moderated on a sequential basis due to certain inventory adjustments by customers in the Commercial Aero supply chain. There is a significant technology transition that is occurring in the Commercial Aero market. New airplanes are adopting innovative electronic features and are incorporating, in particular, new higher technology interconnect solutions to enhance fuel efficiency and improve passenger experience. This all creates a great opportunity for Amphenol. Looking forward, while we expect normal seasonal moderation in the third quarter, we have a very positive long-term outlook for the Commercial Aero market in the second half of 2012 and beyond.","The Industrial market represented 15% of our sales in the quarter, and sales increased a very strong 17% from prior year and 20%, sequentially, as we benefited from the Nelson-Dunn acquisition, as well as from further strengthening of organic demand in the many diversified segments of our Industrial business. Our ongoing focus on developing new technologies, combined with our acquisition program, has resulted in the Industrial market reaching a new high of 15% of sales in the quarter. We continue to make excellent progress, broadening our interconnect product offering and increasing our penetration of the many exciting growth segments of this market, including, in the second quarter, alternative energy, oil and gas and heavy equipment. Although we expect sales in the industrial market to moderate seasonally in the third quarter, we look forward to continued strong momentum in this important sector.","The Automotive market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter, and sales increased a very strong 35% from prior year and were down slightly on a sequential basis as we had expected. We are benefiting from a continued increase in vehicle production volumes and new electronics applications. Together with the important contributions from our recent automotive acquisition, we have been very successful in our drive to broaden our Automotive product offering, both through our internal technology developments and our continued focus on acquiring complementary companies in this market, including the acquisition in this quarter of Deutgen. We expect demand in the Automotive market to remain stable in the third quarter, and we look forward to further long-term progress as we take more advantage of the ongoing revolution in automotive electronics.","The Mobile Devices market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. Sales decreased 4% from prior year as increased sales of products into new mobile computing platform was more than offset by reductions in sales of mobile phone-related products due to dynamics in that segment. However, we are very pleased that sales in the Mobile Device market increased sequentially by a strong 13% as we realized the benefits of our strong position with advanced technologies in many new complex devices. We expect in the third quarter to see a significant increase in demand in this market, driven by releases of new products by a diverse array of mobile device makers, who are incorporating our high-technology solutions into their new devices. We're very excited by our strong position in new, smart mobile devices, in particular in mobile computing products, including tablets and laptops, and the potential that these create in the second half of 2012 and beyond.","The Mobile Networks market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. While sales decreased 12% from prior year on continued conservatism in that segment, we were pleased to see a sequential increase of 11% from first quarter. We're very encouraged to have achieved 2 consecutive quarters of sequential growth in what has been a very challenging wireless equipment market, a clear indication of our strong technology position in next-generation base stations. Although we expect demand to moderate somewhat on a seasonal basis in the third quarter, we look forward to further long-term strength driven by our broad designing positions on new equipment platforms, as well as by our strong presence with wireless operators around the world.","The Information Technology and Data Communications market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased a strong 12% from prior year and 13%, sequentially, with strength driven in particular by products used in servers and networking equipment. We benefited in the second quarter from several releases of next-generation data center equipment, incorporating a broad array of our leading, high-speed and power interconnect technologies. As our customers continue to strive for new levels of equipment performance in order to handle the dramatic expansion of data traffic that they are seeing, our pipeline of new design opportunities with our next-generation products continues to strengthen. We do expect in the third quarter to see a slight reduction in sales as some customers in this market have moderated their short-term outlooks based on an increased level of uncertainty in the marketplace. Nevertheless, we look forward to further long-term gains as our high-technology solutions are increasingly adopted in customers' new systems.","Finally, the Broadband market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter. Sales decreased slightly from prior year, and we're essentially flat on a sequential basis in what is a stable demand but somewhat less favorable pricing environment among cable operators. Nevertheless, we continue to broaden our technology offering with new cable and interconnect products at the same time as we are strengthening our position in international market. We expect demand in the Broadband market to improve slightly in the third quarter, and we look forward to realizing further benefits from our diversification efforts.","In summary, with respect to the second quarter, I am extremely proud of the Amphenol organization as we continue to execute well in what is very clearly a challenging and dynamic market environment. And in particular, we're very pleased with the company's new records in sales and earnings, as well as the expansion of our already industry-leading margin. Amphenol's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages: the company's leading technology, our growing position with customers in the many diverse markets that we serve, our presence around the globe, a lean and flexible cost structure and, most importantly, an agile and entrepreneurial management team that thrives in every economic cycle.","Now turning to our outlook. Based on normal seasonal patterns, as well as current exchange rates, which incorporates the relatively weaker euro, we now expect the following results: For the third quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1,080,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 and earnings per share in the range of $0.87 to $0.90. For the full year 2012, we expect sales in the range of $4,210,000,000 to $4,250,000,000, and EPS in the range of $3.38 to $3.44. For the full year, this represents sales and EPS growth of 7% to 8% and 11% to 13%, respectively. This increase in full year guidance incorporates our strong second quarter results, as well as a positive outlook for the second half, which more than offsets the significant translation impact from the weaker euro. Given the many uncertainties in the global economy, we are very encouraged by the strong outlook in sales and earnings, which reflects, in particular, the value of the diversification of Amphenol.","The ongoing revolution in electronics continued to create many opportunities for our company, and I am confident in the ability of the outstanding Amphenol management team to continue to capitalize on these opportunities to grow our market position and to expand our profitability and thereby, to drive continued superior performance for Amphenol.","Thank you very much. And operator, at this time, we'd be very happy to take any questions if there may be.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Jim Suva from Citi.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Adam and Diana, can you talk a little bit about -- on the M&A side, it looks like your last year acquisitions have been focused on the automotive industry, which traditionally has not been as big of a focus for the company. And I think right now, if my math is correct, it's around 11% at Amphenol. The outlook for this, do you see this growing to be a more material part of Amphenol going forward, like could it eventually be a quarter of the company or something like that? And then in the same vein of Amphenol in automotive, one has to be conscious of many of the other automotive connector and supplier companies don't generate the profitability that Amphenol does, yet you continue to post industry-high profitability. Can you help us understand, is the profitability of automotive below your sector average, at your company average? And why would you be outreaching all those other ones-- competitors?","R. Adam Norwitt","Jim, that is a lot of questions in one, and I'll see if I can remember them well. I think your question started off to, say, we have made some automotive acquisitions. And yes, it's true. We have made several. Obviously, the acquisition of Nelson-Dunn was very different. That was in the Industrial Oil and Gas market, but we're very pleased with the acquisitions that we've made. And if we go back and look at the evolution of our Automotive business, it has been always our strategy, and it is today, to participate in those areas of the automotive market where we can create the value with our customers that thereby allows us to realize the returns that we expect for Amphenol. That strategy has not changed by one iota through these acquisitions. What has changed, though, in that time period is there has been a real revolution of electronics in the car, driving new applications, new functionalities, whereby the Amphenol technology offering allows us to create value for those customers, and thereby, to realize the returns that we expect. And the returns in our Automotive business, we don't talk about what they are by each market, but certainly, they're very strong and we're very proud of those returns. If we look in a car today, a car in my mind has essentially become a host for new electronic features. And whatever those features may be, whether that's onboard electronics in the cockpit, whether that is new engine control, whether that is new transmission control, whether that is hybrid electronic drive that go into cars, what is common with all of these new applications that we're participating in and what is common with the acquisitions that we have made to that end is that these are new functionalities where the interconnect products have a more challenging technology to them and thereby, there is more value to be created with the customers. So this is a very consistent strategy. I think we have made kind of a change in terms of having those more acquisitions, but that is really going along with the fact that we have seen the real explosion of new electronic opportunities in the car, and we have made, also, great gains organically in that market at the same time. So I think this is not a change, Jim. We're very excited about it. Could it be 25% of the company, I think you said. And look, we're very proud of diversification of Amphenol. We don't have any market today that represents 25% of our sales. And I think we look to continue to be a very diverse company. Could Automotive be slightly more than it is today or slightly less? Absolutely. We don't set a sort of a goal for that, but what it will be is that we'll always be focused on those products where we can create value and thereby can realize the returns that we want.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just wanted to dig in to your guidance a little bit. At the midpoint, you guided revenue up about 2.7%. And then when we look at the segment commentary, I think from what I was writing down, it looks like you're only expecting the Mobile Devices segment and the Broadband segments to be up, with everything else moderating, I think it was what you used. I just want to make sure I understand that. And also, in terms of the Auto segment, you commented that, that would be stable, but I would expect that to be up with the acquisition. So maybe some detail on the segment guidance as we move into September.","Diana G. Reardon","Sure. I think you're referring specifically to the guidance for Q3. Is that correct?","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, I am. Yes.","Diana G. Reardon","Okay. And I think that the market growth that you described is pretty much right on from a sequential perspective when we look at the growth, as Adam said in the comments that he made. We do expect to see a significant increase in mobile device sales based on the expectation for our participation in a broad range of new programs that we expect to ramp up. We expect for, I'd say, about half of the markets that tend to have a seasonally softer quarter in the summer, the Defense market, Comm Aero, Industrial, Auto, we expect these to be slightly down sequentially and others to be slightly down to flat. From an Automotive perspective, we also have the phenomenon in the quarter, as I think you know, relative to exchange and specifically to the impact of the euro. And so that is a negative from a sequential perspective. That's more pronounced, actually, in the Automotive market and essentially offsets the positive impact of the small acquisition that we made. So that's why Automotive, without the negative impact from the euro, would, to your point with the acquisition, be up sequentially. Does that help?","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That does. Diana, that is helpful. And then -- sorry, if I could just ask about Telecom. You guys are doing very well in the Telecom segment, and I think most of the commentary we've heard from other companies and some of the equipment makers is the telecom segment continues to be very weak. So I just wanted to understand why you guys are doing so much better than the market in that segment.","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure. That's a very good question. I appreciate it. Look, what we call Telecom, we call it IT & Datacom. I think that's the market that you're referring to, and I think we -- our company is doing extremely well in that segment. We grew 12% year-over-year, 13% sequentially, and I don't think you would see that performance from any of the kind of ON customers in that market. Why is that? It's very clear for us. It's coming because of new programs with new technology. We are participating on a very, very broad basis, really across the board with high-speed technologies as these systems have to perform at higher and higher speed to satisfy the demand for things like video on the Internet that's hogging so much bandwidth in the core systems, as well as at the enterprise level. In addition, power has become such a tremendous driver for us, whereby we are creating new power solutions that go on to this IT & Datacom equipment to allow them to have a more efficient power consumption, which is the real sort of other -- the flip side of the data revolution is they're using a lot of power. And so, to the extent that you can create an interconnect solution that enables customers to equip their equipment with a less power-hungry system, that allows you to create value for the customers. It allows you to take broader positions on the new platform, and it allows us in the end to outperform the market. And I think we feel very good about our overall performance. We have a very, very broad position in IT & Datacom, and we are present essentially with all customers in that market to some degree or another. And so it is really not that we are leveraged on just one customer or one program, but rather that we are gaining share with new technology solutions on a very, very broad basis in that market.","Operator","Our next question or comment comes from Shawn Harrison from Longbow Research.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","I just wanted to, I guess, follow up on that mobility -- the mobile device strength. Is that -- I wanted to be certain. It sounds like it's across notebooks, tablets and phones. Is that just a third quarter phenomenon? Or is that something where you continue to see strength throughout the -- through the end of the calendar year?","R. Adam Norwitt","No. I think -- first of all, you're correct that, that is really more across the board. It's not on any one platform. It's not with any one customer, by the way. I mean, it's a very broad position that we have on some of these new devices. And it's something that -- it was part of what gave us sort of the confidence to raise our guidance both in the third quarter and for the full year. So that is not just a one-quarter phenomenon, necessarily. And we had strong performance in that market on a sequential basis in the second quarter as well. It was up 13% in the second quarter. We've done a great job of really diversifying ourselves into high-value products. We talked about over the last several quarters -- you may, of course, recall, Shawn, we had a quarter -- fourth quarter last year, where our sales in that market were actually down more than we would have expected and more than we would have liked. Sales in the first quarter were year-over-year down. I think we have never rested here. We've never sort of said, \"Well, we're not going to keep the focus on creating new technology solutions for these new products.\" And I think a lot of those efforts that our team has been expending over the better part of the year, 1.5 years, are really bearing fruit here in the second and even more over in the third and fourth quarters of the year.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. That's great. And then just as a follow-up, great margins this quarter within the Connector business. I guess the guidance implies a little bit more limited margin lift in the back half of the year. Maybe you could talk about maybe the pluses and minuses you're seeing that could lead to some further margin expansion in the next 2 quarters.","Diana G. Reardon","Sure. Look, I mean, I think we have a great track record from a margin perspective. And as you say, we achieved certainly good profitability in Q2. I mean, I think, if we look at the last 2 quarters, and go back to the fourth quarter of 2011, we brought margins up from 18.5% to -- in that quarter to 19.4% here in Q2. And there are certainly a lot of things that contribute to that. Certainly, volume and the operating levers that we're able to produce in the business is the most important part of that. I think that this comes really through the combination of the strong technology focus that Adam talked about but also a continuous drive for low cost. The growth in -- from a volume perspective and our ability to convert that at that 25%-plus range, I think, is the most important aspect for our ability to continue to expand margins. And this growth opportunity for us is very much driven by the diversity in the business. The environment right now is -- certainly, one would not say it is completely bullish across all the markets that we serve, and I think that it's an environment where there's a lot of volatility in demand. This actually seems to have become more the norm. And I think the diversity that we have as a company allows us to find the pockets of opportunity for growth that are out there, like the ones that Adam was just describing. When we then combine that with the entrepreneurial management style we have as a company that really maximizes our profitability, that produces this leverage that, I think, we've seen historically and that clearly we've seen in the last 2 quarters. And we continue to include that 25% conversion margin, that operating leverage, on incremental sales in the guidance that we gave both in Q3 and in Q4. There will be some variation in what those conversion margins are. I think we had a slightly higher conversion margin in Q1 than we had in Q2, but I think we feel very good about the profitability level. We feel good about the fact that the team is still committed to further margin expansion, and that that's reflected in the guidance that we gave. We always try to do better if we can, but I think the 25% conversion margin that we've included is the right guidance, and I think it's the right expectation for the second half of the year.","Operator","Our next question or comment comes from Matt Sheerin from Longbow Research.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","It's Matt Sheerin with Stifel, Nicolaus. Just another follow-up on that mobility question, Adam. It looks like your strategy has evolved a little bit, where you were very strong in smartphones. And my understanding is that, as those products become more commoditized, you're moving upstream into tablets. And then now, you've also mentioned notebooks, where you haven't had a lot of presence outside of the RF antennas. So could you talk about the opportunities in that space, smartphones versus tablets? And then also, the ultrabooks, are they representing the big opportunity in notebooks for you?","R. Adam Norwitt","No. This is a very fine question, Matt. I appreciate it. No doubt about it. When we talk about mobile devices, we are certainly -- our view of what a mobile device is, has evolved. And I think that evolution is very natural given all the product transformations that have happened over, really, the last 48 months, 24 months, whatever you want to say. We still have a very strong presence in smartphones, but we are also very deliberate about making sure that we participate in those products where we can create value. And I know I've said that several times on the call, so I must sound like a broken record. But there's no question that there have been some devices that have been released, whether it's just not the appreciation of the value for the products that we would make and thus, we don't want to participate. Conversely, we have never had a very strong position on computers, which evolved into laptops. But over the recent time period, those devices have converged more to become more mobile devices. I know myself. I am on my laptop in the car, and it is essentially almost like a phone. I mean, you use Skype on it and it becomes essentially a phone that sits on your lap. And as those devices have become more embedded with more functionalities, as the ultrabooks have come along and bridged between traditional laptops and tablets -- and who knows what's going to come next? I mean, what do you call a device, which is the surface that gets the nod? Is that a tablet? Is it an ultrabook? What is it? I mean -- so I think that there is a real combining of a lot of different functionalities with one thing in common, and that is that these devices are mobile. They're connected to mobile networks. They're connected to wireless networks somewhere. You can transport them with you. And wherever we see the opportunity to enable those devices to have a greater functionality, either through the antenna technology, either through our interconnect technology, through some of the other componentry that we supply into those products, we're going to capitalize upon that. And I think the team is not fixated on just one customer. That's one thing that's very, very important. Our team of engineers and sales individuals and the factories, they are focused on ferreting out every opportunity in that industry because the one strategy that we have not changed is we're not in the business of picking which is going to be the winner. We're in the business of maximizing our content on attractive platforms and then letting, in the end, the marketplace to decide what the winner is going to be. And if we've done a good job of getting our position, then we'll win with whatever that winner may be. And so I think it's a very exciting market for us. It has been an exciting market for us, 17% of our sales in the quarter, and we look forward to strong momentum there going forward.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And just a quick follow-up, Diana. What percentage of your Auto business now is in Europe?","Diana G. Reardon","I can't give you an exact percentage, but somewhere -- probably a little less than 2\/3 or so, but it would be in that range.","Operator","Our next question or comment comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","When you look at the midpoint of guidance both for the third quarter and for the full year, it implies a flat sequential 3Q versus 4Q. And I'm just wondering, is that because you're seeing something in particular that will drive below normal seasonality? Is there something like a pull-in effect that you saw in 3Q in mobile devices last year or something similar to that? Or is it just lack of visibility for now?","Diana G. Reardon","Yes. I think that from a sequential standpoint, there is a slight difference between the 2 quarters, but to your point, not much. I think this is what we see when we look at a very detailed forecast level, what the 2 quarters look like. We -- I think as Adam said, we expect to see a significant ramp-up in the mobile device market in Q3 here in the near term. And I think that, that is driving some of the sequential dynamics between Q2 and Q3. We don't expect a same step function when we look between Q3 and Q4. So I think that this is based on what we expect the sales to look like based on the details, the view of all of the markets that we've done. At this point, when we get closer, we'll see what the quarter looks like at that point in time, but we wouldn't expect the same type of significant sequential uptick in the mobile device market in Q4 that we're seeing in Q3. And I think that has some impact with the comparison.","R. Adam Norwitt","It is not a pull-in though. I mean, I think, you're referring, Wamsi, to a year ago where we saw that kind of significant pull-in of demand from the fourth quarter to the third quarter. That's not what we anticipate. I think the guidance does not anticipate a down fourth quarter. But let's not forget, there is a lot of uncertainty in the world today, and I think this is very prudent guidance given the level of uncertainty that is in many markets, and certainly, in many geographies around the world.","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Adam, that is specifically what I was referring to. So I appreciate the color there. And then, Diana, perhaps you could address how the pricing environment is. I mean, copper and gold are down both quarter-on-quarter, but gold is still up year-on-year. Is this environment in which you're still able to increase prices?","Diana G. Reardon","Yes, I think the pricing dynamics, as you know, Wamsi, vary a lot from a market-to-market perspective. And I think they continue pretty much to track the pricing dynamics that one would see in a related equipment that we sell into. So I think in the communications-related markets, those prices, certainly, still trend down. And I think that what we have seen in 2012 -- so I think we see a better balance between the movements in prices and the movements in cost structure, which, as you know, in 2011 was very much out of balance and this puts a particularly strong pressure on margin. So I wouldn't say that it's an easier pricing environment. I would just say that it's a pricing environment that's more rational given what we see happening from an input cost perspective. But as you know, the market is a very dynamic one and seems to be choppy, to take a word from a demand perspective, depending on which market you will look at. And that always has some impact on pricing dynamics as well. But I think that we're able to manage pretty well through the environment as long as cost and price are in balance. And I think that's how we would describe -- how 2012 looks to us as we sit here today.","Operator","Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach from Goldman Sachs.","Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Adam, a number of times that the macro environment has come up on this call, so I'm just curious if you can contrast kind of what you're seeing this summer versus last summer. Anything from kind of order patterns or customer conversations would be helpful.","R. Adam Norwitt","Craig, look, I have to sort of plunge the depths of my memory to think back on what it was last year. I think last year, when we really saw a shift within the third quarter, when there are all of these sort of government-driven, around the world uncertainties that came, the debt ceiling debate, the Europe and Greece sort of first materializing on the scene, what we see now is kind of a general hesitancy. I think people see the market. People read the papers. I was in Europe recently and I can tell you, you don't even want to read the papers in the morning when you're in Europe. At the end of the day though, our customers are in the business that we are in, which is creating new electronics for their customers. And I think we continue to see just a tremendous, tremendous pace of innovation that is happening. And I talked about that in the IT market, where the pace of innovation is something that we've been able to capitalize on very much. The same is true in the mobile devices market. And the same, arguably, is true across the board in all of our markets. So we haven't heard any customers today coming out and sort of singing doom-and-gloom songs here. Rather, there is just a general unease about what is going to happen. I think people don't have confidence in governments anymore to solve the problem. They're not sure where markets are headed. And at the end of the day, that creates that level of unease. At the same time, they're making a product that customers are thirsting for. I mean, take wireless infrastructure. I mean, this is a classic market where there is a clear demand by the end consumer to have upgrades in technology. I mean, you just can't go anywhere in the world today and be satisfied as a customer with a mobile device. The customers all know that. The operators know that. The smart ones are driving upgrades at a significant pace. Others are taking a little bit more of a wait-and-see attitude. I think we've seen that market expand a couple of quarters in a row, and that's a good sign, but it's just indicative of the type of general hesitancy that is there. At end of the day for Amphenol, we're not running the company based on microeconomic trends and forecasts and headlines in the Wall Street Journal. We're running the company based on what we see with our customers on new programs, new technologies and driving the execution and reacting to whatever the macro environment will bring our way.","Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. As a follow-up on the Commercial Aerospace side, the adjustment in inventory. Would you characterize that as a pause here? And if you can kind of just talk through your expectations once you get through that.","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes. I think it's actually pretty normal. The way the Commercial Aero market works is they do these sort of step function increases in either new platforms or production rates. And those tend to happen early on in the year. And it's not abnormal that when there is kind of a ramp-up, and you recall we saw a significant ramp-up in the first quarter. We saw some in the fourth quarter. It's not uncommon for the hundreds of companies that are involved in that supply chain to not get it perfect as they go through the sort of annual ramp-ups that are happening. I mean, there's no doubt about it that the plane volume that we're seeing or that our customers are creating today are up significantly. I mean, if you take just the 2 largest, their volumes of airplanes are up 14%, 15% in what they're producing and delivering on a year-over-year basis. But a lot of that tends to happen really -- at the end of the year. They set their production plan. They ramp up the supply chain. And then sometimes, there is a kind of a flex and a little bit of like an accordion effect on the supply chain when they do that ramp-up and then it normalizes over time. So this is -- that sequential performance to us is not at all a concern. We view that, that strong year-over-year performance, which is something that we expect to continue throughout the year, is really indicative of both the increase in unit volumes that we're seeing together with our broader position that comes on the new platform. And that's something that we continue to look forward to. We have not really seen a lot of the new airplanes being produced in significant volumes yet, and I think that's something still to come at some point. When they all start being made exactly, when the delays and the kinks are worked out, that remains to be seen, but we feel very good about that market and our position in the market going forward.","Operator","Our next question or comment comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just maybe I want to start off with the OpEx side of the equation. Things are obviously pretty good this quarter, $120 million OpEx up. How should we think about OpEx run rate going forward? And do you still have some of the cost savings from the restructuring you did late in 2011 that still need to be realized?","Diana G. Reardon","Sure. I think that by OpEx, you're referring to what we call SG&A. And I think that this is an area that, certainly, we got a lot of operating leverage on in the quarter. We're back down to about 12.1% of sales, which is essentially where we were in the middle 2 quarters of last year. We do, really, a very good job of managing all levels of cost, and we focus on SG&A cost as much as we do on manufacturing cost. We target SG&A or OpEx to grow about half the rate of sales, all else being the same. In some quarters, we hit that and in some quarters, we don't. But I think that we do still have some leverage that we will see as we move through the second half of the year on both, in SG&A and on the gross margin line, as we look to work -- to hit those 25% incremental conversion operating income margins that we have as a target and that we've reflected in the guidance for the Q3 and then Q4 time frames.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Perfect. And if I could just follow up. Adam, if you just talk about the handset side. I realize you guys are obviously expecting some strong sequential growth due to ramp in Q3. Could you maybe just talk about how do you have comfort at this point that this could not be a replication of what happened in the back half of 2011, where you had a really strong Q3 but it resulted in a bit of a vacuum in Q4. Are you more diversified on a product or customer basis that gives you more comfort that, that doesn't happen again?","R. Adam Norwitt","Amit, I think the simple answer is, we are more diversified in new products. I think the market is more diversified in new products. I think we're a good reflection on the market. If you just take an honest look at things, there is a more diverse market of smart mobile devices today than there was a year ago. And clearly, we're present really on a broad basis there. I think that if we look last year, there was that expectation of a very significant ramp-up coming into the fourth quarter, which then didn't materialize. We don't see those expectations today. So if I go back to a year ago, July 17, July 18, I think I've said many times to several of you on the phone that our customers, at that point, were extraordinarily bullish towards the fourth quarter and were ramping their supply chains in anticipation of the tremendous, tremendous fourth quarter 2011. We don't see that today. I think customers are very balanced in their view of the trends in their business from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. And thus, they are not over-accelerating their supply chains and their procurement activities, which led to some of what we saw last year. And so from that perspective -- look, anything can happen, obviously. But I think the kind of data points that we see, the conversations that we have with customers, lead me to be a little bit more comfortable that you're not getting that overspending of demand, which then could lead to a falloff like we saw last year.","Operator","Our next question or comment comes from Steven Fox from Cross Research.","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","I had 2 questions, please. First, on the Broadband business slowing down. Looked like you were starting to get some momentum there and now you're talking about some price pressures. Can you provide a little more color around what's going on there and sort of your outlook maybe 4 to 6 -- over the next 4 to 6 quarters for that business? And then secondly, Diana, if you just happen to have organic growth for Industrial and Automotive handy, that'd be helpful.","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure. Well, let me just talk about Broadband for a second here, Steve. I think we have had good momentum there. Look, that market does go in cycles to some extent. I think that what we have seen is we would have expected the pricing environment in that market to be supportive of further margin expansion based on the competitive environment, and that's what we did not see. And so when we talk about less favorable pricing environment in the quarter, as I've always said, we are going to follow any price increase from the market leader. And that just was not forthcoming here when we would have expected that one would have taken the opportunity with the material environment that was more normalized to keep realizing the margins that you could realize. And so that's really to that extent. As we look forward in that market, I mean, there are clearly a lot of dynamics in the market, whether that is Broadband over Cable, whether that is in the Satellite market, whether that is in -- over Telecom. I mean, there are just tremendous, different array of ways that people are getting broadband into their house today. We capitalize on all of those. And so all that we care about really going forward is, are -- is there further adoption of high-speed, next-generation broadband into the home? And that's something where we think there clearly is that consistent trend that would support our participation in the market. What is the criteria? The criteria is that you're able to support those new technologies with a strong product offering. And that's why the focus of our team in that market has been very, very consistent: innovation, innovation, innovation. Getting the right products that can support those new demands that are coming from customers in that market. Whatever their end means, whether that is hybrid fiber coax, whether that is twisted pair, whether that is satellite, whatever, we want to be there to support the technologies that are there. And because of that and because we're not just betting on one MSO to be successful, or on one satellite operator to be successful, we feel that if we can have a strong technology solution for that market, there is great opportunity for growth in the future. I think with respect to the organic growth rate, I don't know. Diana, do you want to comment?","Diana G. Reardon","Sure, in Industrial, as you know, this would be the year-over-year organic growth rate. Industrial is low double digit and Automotive, mid single digit.","R. Adam Norwitt","Which is a very strong performance in the environment.","Operator","Our next question or comment comes from Mike Wood from Macquarie.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","With the mobile devices' significant sequential increase that you'd mentioned, is that based on orders that are in your backlog or reflected in that 0.99 book-to-bill? Or do you also have some more visibility with like a request for price or certain platforms that are coming? And how long would that visibility last for you?","R. Adam Norwitt","That market is not necessarily a market where you get 16-week or 12-week or even 8-week lead times on orders. You work on programs that get released into the marketplace. And obviously, customers need to build a supply chain pipeline to support the ramp-up of new programs. And so it's a much more sort of a rich interaction with the customers to understand the volumes that are going to come. It's not here comes -- it's not just one data point or one order or one forecast from a customer. It's a very, very comprehensive approach to being involved in the program with the customer, knowing the timing and knowing the volumes that they have. Obviously, programs get delayed. Programs get accelerated. Some are successful. Some are not successful. And we have a significant amount of experience dealing with the various dynamics that come in those new programs. We're always going to apply some degree of caution to that in terms of how we invest in ourselves, how we proceed with the ramp-ups and obviously, how we incorporate that into our outlook for the company.","Operator","Our next question or comment comes from Mike Wherley from Janney Capital Markets.","Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I was just wondering if you could give us any commentary on the trends, month-to-month, through the quarter and into July in China and the U.S.","R. Adam Norwitt","Well, I think we have not seen anything abnormal in those trends. I think if we look overall for the company it was a relatively normal quarter in terms of how the months progress. The last month of the quarter tends to be a little bit stronger, there are some vacations in certain places in May. So I think there was nothing abnormal that we would comment on relative to China, U.S. or for that matter, Europe through -- in the course of how the quarter proceeded.","Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And since the quarter ended, any comments on July?","R. Adam Norwitt","No, nothing abnormal for the guidance that we have given today.","Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And the other question I just had was on M&A. Are there any targets that you might consider that are bigger than what you've done historically, like in the $300 million to $400 million range? Or are you just a lot more comfortable with things that are like $200 million or less?","R. Adam Norwitt","Look, I think we've said consistently for many years that size is not a criteria for Amphenol as it relates to acquisitions. Our criteria for acquisitions is we want, number one, good people; we want, number two, very strong technology and complementary technology; we want, number three, a complementary market position that's really additive to Amphenol and expands the breadth of our offering in one or more of the many markets that we serve. To that extent, there are plenty of larger companies that are out there that would be attractive acquisitions. And I think we're very fortunate to have a financial condition that really sets no limits on size. And our mindset also sets no limits on size. What we wouldn't do is just do one big acquisition for the sake of adding sales to the company. That's not the strategy of acquisitions, but we'd be very excited to proceed with an acquisition to the extent that it were for sale of a company that really satisfies those other criteria that we consistently talk about and emphasize.","Operator","Our next question or comment is from Amitabh Passi from UBS.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I have 2 questions, if I may. Diana, first question for you, just on gross margins. I think they were flat sequentially, slightly down year-over-year despite sales being up. How do we think about the leverage in the model? Is it mainly coming through OpEx? Or is there further room to maybe expand gross margins? And then, Adam, just for you, on your mobile infrastructure end market, I think you said it was up 11% sequentially. Some of the large OEMs, their commentary has been less than inspirational. So I was just wondering was the upside on the antenna side, base station side? If you could maybe just provide some color there.","Diana G. Reardon","Sure, maybe I'll start with the first question, and I think this was a question relative to the components of our ROS expansion. And you rightly point out that the gross margin expansion, as a discrete line on the P&L, has been less part of the operating income expansion in this quarter. And I think that, that certainly is true. I guess what I would say, Amitabh, is we really manage the business to maximize and expand the operating profit. And we believe this is really a necessary approach to make sure that all of the costs on the P&L get equal attention by operating management. This has been our consistent approach for decades, and we feel that this is the right approach to expand operating income return. We have a really diversified product and market footprint, and that results in some products and markets having higher gross margins and higher SG&A and some have lower gross margins and lower SG&A. And sometimes, you have an impact from translation if rates move around, the acquisitions that we do can also sometimes have an impact relative to how their cost structure is. And so from our perspective, ROS expansion is the goal and as is this 25%-plus conversion margin on incremental sales. And that is something that we have achieved and that is something that we do have still incorporated in guidance for Q3 and Q4. I think if we talk specifically about the rest of the year, I think we probably will see some contribution to operating margin expansion from both gross margin and SG&A in the second half of the year. But from our standpoint by us, a management team, what we really care about is whether the ROS is expanding, not what specifically the gross margin or SG&A does. We work to maximize the bottom line. It's a very simple approach. It's a straightforward one. And we think based on our experience, it's very effective in expanding margins.","R. Adam Norwitt","Amitabh, with respect to your second question on wireless infrastructure, I think you used the phrase, \"less than inspiring\" in terms of their comments over the last couple of days. I would describe the market has been less than inspiring over the last 5 or 6 quarters. I mean, that has been certainly a challenging market. We are very pleased to have had that growth in the quarter, sequentially 11% up over the quarter. And I think your question was, is that coming from different sales than just to OEMs? The fact of the matter is that we had strong performance on both sides of the business, even slightly stronger on the equipment side with the OEMs on a sequential basis. And I think that comes from just a strong position that we've gotten on new base station platforms. There has been a real technology transformation that's been going on in that market for the better part of 2 years now as the equipment manufacturers have migrated to these lower cost, more modular base stations. I think that has had a negative result on them because they're selling their products a heck of a lot cheaper than they ever were before. It also had, to some extent, a negative impact on the content of interconnect products as you go from a big box, the size of a refrigerator, to something that is not all that much bigger than a server today in a base station. Obviously, there is a different level of interconnect. However, what we have seen is as those new base stations get more ruggedized because they're putting them up on tops of towers, they're putting them on tops of buildings, that the new interconnect requirements that are being required now for that new technology has allowed us to gain further position with our customers and start to see the kind of fruits of those designing labors coming through this quarter and last quarter, with now 2 sequential quarters of growth. Our Antenna business continues to be a very strong business. We have a leading position with some very strong customers around the world. Obviously, the operators' spending cycles -- they come and they go. I mean, you look today, China and India is not the kind of frothy market that it once was. The U.S. is not a bad market. Europe is -- there's a lot of uncertainty. And you probably read the release today from one of the players in that space that says that in Europe, there is some macro uncertainty that's driving different spending patterns. Our strategy there is not to bet on a region. It's not to pick one of the equipment manufacturers as our only horse to ride. It's to try to have a broad position across all the operators that we can and across all the equipment makers that we can with a broad array of product offering in RF products, in fiber optics, in high power, high speed. And so with that broad power -- product offering that we have, we're able to capitalize, to some extent, better as these new products take hold and even if those new products are these lower-priced products that don't necessarily help the sales of our customers.","Operator","Our next question or comment comes from Brian White from Topeka.","Brian John White - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Adam, on the mobile device market in the third quarter, do you feel like you're gaining share? Or is this just a reflection of the marketplace?","R. Adam Norwitt","Well, I think I would say we're gaining share. I wouldn't expect that the market is going 30%. But gaining share in that market, it's hard to say. What does that mean, gaining share, because we're designing totally new products into totally new products. And so to that extent, is that gaining share? Is that not gaining share? Certainly, we're gaining position in the broader marketplace. Is it coming out of one person's hide or someone else's hide? I think that's harder to quantify. It's a new thing. And so to the extent that we're making some new antenna or some new interconnect or some new mechanical thing that goes on to these devices, that is kind of a new business that is not coming out of someone else's hands or teeth here. And so typically, when one says, \"Are you gaining shares?\" that means someone else is losing and you're winning. I think in this case, we're winning as the new technology evolves. And that's something that is -- that's been a real focus for us. This is not a market where you want to get into just kind of share battle because the pricing dynamics in the market where you get into share battles, those are not -- there is not going to be any winner in the end for that. The way to win is with new technologies and with a strong and very dynamic, speedy support of these new product ramps. And I think that's one area where we have worked for the better part of the decade, to build an organization that is highly responsive, really turning on a moment's notice, turning new samples, turning new designs for customers, doing what it takes on a 24 hour a day clock to make sure that our customers can release their products on time and thereby, they come back to you when they need another new technology and they have another new device going forward. It's hard to say what device it's going to be, actually, in the future. I mean, we talked about how we view that market more broadly today than we did 2 years ago. Who knows if, in 2 years, whether there is going to be some other new thing that's out there that's going to be called a mobile device? But what I can tell you is, to the extent that there is value for our products to be on it, we're going to work darn hard to make sure that we're present.","Brian John White - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And just a follow-up, book-to-bill ratio, as I remember, was 1.05 March quarter, 0.99 in the June quarter. Just how do we think about that? It looks like the biggest decline since June quarter '08. How do we think about that in the marketplace?","Diana G. Reardon","I think, Brian, that the book-to-bill ratio in the first quarter was probably a little bit on the high side, higher than what we ordinarily would see if you look back historically. I think a 0.99:1 book-to-bill ratio in Q2 is not such an unusual phenomenon for us. So I would say that more -- that the Q1 book-to-bill ratio was probably more on the high side, which makes that comparison maybe look a little funny when you look at the 2 quarters together. But Q2, in terms of our order levels, we feel good about where they are. We feel that the book-to-bill ratio makes sense relative to the guidance that we've given and so forth. As you know, some of our markets are more book-to-bill in the same quarter, and that can have an impact on what that ratio looks like.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tony Kure from KeyBanc.","Anthony C. Kure - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones here. You mentioned the strength in the datacom markets into the second quarter and then it seems like with the expectation going forward, there's a pretty material shift in sentiment. Was there some sort of turning event or some sort of time period where you saw a definite shift in more caution out of your datacom customers?","R. Adam Norwitt","I wouldn't say that there is sort one turning point. I think that there's kind of been a general evolution of the sentiment. And again, I wouldn't describe that as horribly negative. It's not that we're saying that market is going to be down double digits in the third quarter. I think there is some degree of caution in the third quarter with respect to the end sales of their product. I think that in addition, there's many new products that are coming on board and to the extent they're sort of seeing are they selling or not selling, and that's something that happens also at the time of new product releases with customers. So I don't think there was a moment where everybody said they're kind of freaked out, and said it's all going bad. It's not at all. I think the reason why I made those comments is typically, that market would be potentially up in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. We don't necessarily see that this quarter. We see it more sort of slightly down to flattish. And thereby, that implies to us that there is some conservatism and some uncertainty in that marketplace, but this is not -- no cataclysm here.","Anthony C. Kure - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. That color is helpful. And then, Diana, I think you mentioned there was, helping out the margins, there were some more cost reductions. I know it's a normal part of the business in the second quarter but maybe -- you could maybe scale those for us and how they -- how the second quarter cost reductions may have compared to the size of the cost reductions, I think, you had in the first quarter or even if you annualize them versus 2011. I guess just maybe scale, how big the cost reductions were relative to prior periods.","Diana G. Reardon","Yes, I'm not sure that I could give you a quantification on a consolidated basis of exactly how those would compare. I think that we -- every quarter and every month, each of the operating management team works to really minimize the entire cost structure, whether we're talking about manufacturing or SG&A-related cost. And I think that is an important part of where that operating leverage in the business comes from. So it's really the combination of the volume. And that volume then creates opportunity if you do a really strong job of cost control to get that margin expansion that you've seen us achieve in the last 2 quarters, in Q1 and Q2, and the further margin expansion that we have included in the guidance in the second half of the year. I think that the management team is certainly, I would say, working as hard as they ever have been to create sufficient cost reduction opportunities to keep that margin expansion going. And certainly, I wouldn't say that this is the easiest environment that we're in right now, but certainly, the team is up to the challenge and are very excited to continue to grow margin as we grow the top line here in Q3. So that's about as much of a quantification as I can give you.","Operator","And I'm currently showing no further questions or comments at this time.","R. Adam Norwitt","Very good. Well, we'd like to express our thanks to all of you for the time today, and I'd like to also take this opportunity to wish you all a pleasant summer. I hope you each get the opportunity to take a little bit of rest from your busy schedules. And we look forward to hearing your voices again here in the fall. Thank you all very much, and have a pleasant day.","Diana G. Reardon","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for attending today's conference, and have a nice day."],"2244":["Amphenol Corp.

Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the Company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.","Craig Lampo","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO. And I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2017 conference call. Our fourth quarter 2017 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter and then Adam will give an overview of the business, as well as current trends. Then we will take questions.","As a reminder, we may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information.","The Company closed the fourth quarter with record sales of $1.944 billion exceeding the high end of the Company\u2019s guidance for sales by approximately $145 million and achieving new records of performance. ","Sales were up 18% in U.S. dollars and up 16% in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the fourth quarter increased a very strong 13%. Sequentially, sales were up 6% in U.S. dollars and local currencies and organically. Breaking down sales into our two segments. Our Cable business, which comprises 5% of our sales, was down 5% from the fourth quarter of last year. The Interconnect business, which comprised 95% of our sales, was up 19% in U.S. dollars from last year, driven primarily by organic growth, as well as the impact of acquisitions.","For the full year of 2017, sales were a record $7.011 billion, up 12% in US dollars and in local currencies and up a very strong 8% organically compared to 2016, an excellent performance. ","Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income was $399 million for the fourth quarter, up 18% from 2016 and operating margin was a strong 20.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017, equal to our record and comparable to both the fourth quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2017.","From a segment standpoint, in the Cable segment, margins were 11.2%, which is down compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 at 14.9%, primarily driven by an increase in certain commodity costs together with the lower volumes. In the Interconnect segment, margins were strong 22.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017, equal to the fourth quarter of last year. ","For the full year of 2017, the company delivered $1.432 billion in adjusted operating income, up strong 15% from 2016.","We continued to be very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement. Both with the achievement of 20.4% on an adjusted basis for the full year which represents the first full year over 20% level, as well as the achievement of 20.5% operating margin in the fourth quarter which reflects a sixth consecutive quarter over 20%. ","This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the Company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster high performance action-oriented culture, in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment.","Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies to both existing and acquired companies, our management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance in the future.","Interest expense for the quarter was $25 million compared to $18 million last year, reflecting the impact of the higher average interest rates, resulting from the senior notes issuance earlier in the year, as well as the higher average debt levels, primarily resulting from the Company's stock buyback program.","During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company incurred one time tax related charge of approximately $400 million or $1.26 per share resulting from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This charge reflects a shift to a modified territorial tax regime and includes our current estimate of the U.S. toll charge related to the deemed repatriation of cumulative unremitted foreign earnings which will be paid over a period of eight years. Local taxes related to the cumulative unremitted foreign earnings due to our intention over time to repatriate our foreign cash which will be paid when those respective earnings are repatriated, partially offset by an adjustment of certain U.S. deferred tax balances due to the change in the tax rate. ","These amounts are the company's best estimate based on the current information and guidance available at this time and represent provisional estimates of the one-time tax related charge associated with the Tax Act which will be finalized in 2018. ","In addition to requiring the one-time charge just discussed, the Tax Act also reduces a substantial portion of the future tax benefits from our stock option program that we have called out during the prior 2017 earnings call. Because of these future tax benefits will be substantially reduced and the fact that 2017 was the first year that excess tax benefits were reflected in income under GAAP, we will exclude these benefits in our presentation of adjusted non-GAAP results for 2017 and onwards because we believe that it will provide a more helpful comparability of [period to period] [ph] results for investors. Please refer to the supplemental financial information in our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP adjusted net income and the diluted EPS for all 2017 quarters which now excludes the excess tax benefits of stock option exercise as well as the other items already noted.","The Company's GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 including the one-time tax related charge partially offset by approximately 550 basis points excess tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options was approximately 127%. Excluding these items, the adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 26.7% for the fourth quarter which is consistent with effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2016. ","For the full year, the adjusted effective tax rate was 26.5% for 2017 which excludes the excess tax benefits from option exercises and was consistent with 2016. On a GAAP basis, the Company's full year effective tax rate was approximately 51% and 27% for 2017 and 2016 respectively, reflecting that 2017 one-time charge and the tax effect of the acquisition related cost incurred during the respective years, partially offset by the approximate 490 basis points excess tax benefit of the exercise of stock option in 2017.","As indicated in earnings release, we are still evaluating the impact of the Tax Act on our going forward effective tax rate. As such based on the current information available we have estimated that the approximate benefit of the Tax Act on our tax rate will be at least one point. Accordingly we have included this approximate benefit in our 2018 guidance. We would like to note that the impact on our going forward effective tax rate are still be evaluated and the effective tax rate reflected in our guidance does not reflect any potential change due to the finalization in 2018 of the one-time tax related charge resulting from the Tax Act. ","Adjusted net income was a strong 14% of sales in both fourth quarter of 2017 and for the full year of 2017. From an EPS perspective, on a GAAP basis including the impact of the Tax Act partially offset by the $0.07 fourth quarter and $0.21 full year excess tax benefit from stock option exercise, we reported diluted loss per share for the fourth quarter of $0.34 and diluted EPS of $2.06 for the full year of 2017. On an adjusted basis for the fourth quarter -- fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS was a record $0.86 which is a 15% increase compared to $0.75 for the comparable in 2016 period. And compared to our adjusted EPS guidance in the fourth quarter at the high end of $0.80 excluding the $0.01 EPS benefit included in our guidance for the fourth quarter related to the expected excess tax benefit of stock option exercises. ","For the full year of 2017, adjusted diluted EPS was a record $3.12, up 15% over 2016 at $2.72. A very strong performance and compares to our adjusted EPS guidance in the full year at the high end of $3.06 excluding the $0.15 EPS benefit included in our guidance for the fourth quarter related to the expected excess tax benefit of stock option exercises. ","This strong growth was supported by excellent operating performance as demonstrated by the company's strong operating margins. ","Orders for the quarter were record $2 billion, a 20% increase over the fourth quarter of 2016, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.03 to 1.","The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was a record $428 million in the quarter and $1.1 billion for the full year, or approximately 156% and 116% of adjusted net income respectively.","From a working capital standpoint, inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were approximately $1.1 billion, $1.6 billion and $875 million respectively at the end of December. In inventory days, day sales outstanding and payables days excluding the impact of acquisition were 76, 73 and 60 days respectively, all within our normal range.","The cash flow from operations of $428 million along with the stock option proceeds of $50 million were used primarily to fund net capital expenditures of $69 million. The purchase approximately $62 million of the Company\u2019s stock, to fund dividend payments of $58 million, to acquisitions of $22 million, and to repay $20 million under the commercial paper program, which resulted in an increase of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $264 million net of translation.","During the quarter, the Company repurchased 700,000 shares at an average price of approximately $89. These repurchases were made under the Company\u2019s $1 billion two year stock repurchase program. And to-date, the Company has repurchased approximately 8.4 million shares or $618 million under the plan. And approximately $318 million of repurchase remain available under the program through January 2019. ","At December 31, cash and short-term investments were approximately $1.8 billion, the majority of which is currently held outside the US. Given the flexibility introduced by the previously discussed Tax Act relative to repatriation of foreign earnings, the company is currently in a process of assessing repatriation opportunities in 2018 and accordance with its capital allocation strategy. We believe the ability to more freely move earnings under the new territorial system will provide additional support for the company's long-term capital allocation strategy which focuses on achieving a balance between organic business development, acquisition growth and shareholder returns including dividend and share buyback. ","Also at the end of the quarter, the Company had issued approximately $1.2 billion under its commercial paper program. The Company's cash and availability under its credit facilities totaled approximately $2.6 billion. Total debt at December 31st was approximately $3.5 billion and net debt is approximately $1.8 billion. Fourth quarter 2017, EBITDA was approximately $469 million bring the Company's fully year EBITDA to a record $1.7 billion. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter and year. ","Before I turn the call over to Adam, I'd like to make a brief comment relative to our 2018 earnings guidance. As mentioned earlier, our 2018 diluted EPS guidance reflects an estimated one point benefit on our 2018 effective tax rate from the Tax Act or approximately 25.5%, which compares to our 2017 adjusted effective tax rate of 26.5%. On that basis, we anticipate diluted EPS of $0.78 to $0.80 for the first quarter of 2018 or 13% to 16% growth versus the first quarter of 2017 adjusted diluted EPS. For the full year 2018, we anticipate diluted EPS of $3.39 to $3.47 which represents a 9% to 11% growth versus full year of 2017 adjusted diluted EPS. ","I'll now turn it over Adam who will provide an overview of the business and comment on current trends. ","Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much Craig and thank you all for taking the time to listen in on our conference call today. And hope it's not too late to wish everybody a Happy New Year. As Craig mentioned, I am going to highlight some of our achievements here in the year both in fourth quarter and 2017. I'll discuss the trends and progress across our served market and then I'll make a few comments on our outlook for the first quarter and the full year of 2018.","With respect to the fourth quarter, I mean Craig went over many of these details but just to reiterate, our results in the fourth quarter was a substantially stronger than expected as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted earnings, and reached new records in order sales and adjusted EPS. Sales grew by a very strong 18% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currency reaching another new record of $1.944 billion. I'll just say that we are pleased in particular that we grew organically in the quarter by very strong 13%. Craig alluded to the company booked a new record $2 billion in orders and that not only represented an excellent book-to-bill of 1.03 to 1 but represent a 20% growth to prior year orders, a very, very strong finish from our booking.","Operating margins were again strong in the quarter equaling our highest ever level of 20.5% and cash flow in the quarter reached a new record $428 million which is just another a great confirmation of the company's financial strength. Just once again as I come out of the fourth quarter, I am just so proud of our team, our results this quarter once again reflects the true value of the discipline and agility of Amphenol's entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst what is always a very dynamic electronics industry all well driving outstanding operating performance for the quarter. ","We are very pleased to be able to announce two new acquisitions. One that was completed late in December and one that was completed here in January. First, Sunpool which we closed on late in the month of December, it's China based provider of high technology antennas for the Chinese automotive market with annual sales of approximately $30 million. Sunpool which is based in the industrial center of North East China is a leader in the Chinese automotive antenna market leveraging its advanced product design strength, together with outstanding vertically integrated and low cost manufacturing capabilities. The company represents another great compliment to both our broad and diversified antenna offering around the world, as well as the great compliment to our growing presence in the Chinese automotive market. CTI Industries which we closed on early here in January is a Canada based manufacture of high technology cable assemblies for a wide array of applications including embedded computing, industrial and automotive. The company which has revenues of approximately $60 million, manufactures its products in Canada, Mexico and China and serve the broad range of important and complimentary customers to our existing customer base. Company enhances our already industry leading value add interconnect capabilities across this really wide range of end markets and application. ","So as we welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, we remained very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisition opportunities and then to successfully bring these new companies into the Amphenol family remains the core competitive advantage for the company. Now just to make a few comments on 2017. I think very clearly 2017 was another outstanding year for Amphenol. We expanded our position in the overall market growing sales by 12% in both U.S. dollars and local currencies reaching a new sales record of $7 billion and $11 million. Organically we grew by a very strong 8% which was significantly higher than we had expected coming into the year. Our full year adjusted operating margin also reached a new record of 20.4% and as Craig mentioned, this is the first time that we exceeded 20% return on sales for our full calendar year. And our strong profitability enabled us to generate adjusted diluted EPS of $3.12 growing also strong 15% from prior year. Operating cash flow and free cash flow also were both records in the year at a $1.144 billion and $921 million respectively and we continue to put that cash to work in our acquisition program, which once again contributed strongly to our performance here in 2017. ","As you recall, we closed on the acquisitions earlier this year of Phitek,i2S, Telect, the 3 sensor businesses of Meggitt and then Sunpool in the fourth quarter and CTI here in January. All these acquisitions have already begun to create value for the company and most importantly we've now been joined by great range of talented individual which thereby deepens the bench of our already impressive management team. In addition to our acquisitions program, we also bought back this year 8.4 million shares under our $1 billion share buyback program and you'll recall increasing -- that we increased our quarterly dividend by 19% during the year. ","The company is consistent and balanced approach to capital deployment, we believe will be further enhance to the increased flexibility afforded by the modified territorial tax system, that's implemented in the recently passed US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We believe the ability to more freely move the company's earnings under this new territorial system will provide additional support for our consistent, long-term capital allocation strategy, which focuses on achieving a balance between investing in organic business development, acquisition growth and delivering shareholder returns including our dividends and share buyback program. ","Our long-term mission remains the same and that is to be the enablers of the electronics revolution. And through the organic development efforts of our worldwide entrepreneurial organization together with the benefits from our acquisition program, we've expanded our partnerships with the broadening array of customers across all of our diversified end market. This has resulted in Amphenol strengthening our position across the many segments of the electronic industry. ","While the overall market environment in 2017 was certainly very dynamic as we enter 2018 our agile entrepreneurial management team is highly confident that we've built a platform strength from which we can drive superior, long-term performance. ","Now turning to the trends in our served markets and just reflecting back again on 2017, we were very pleased that our balanced and broad end market diversification is continue to create real value for the company. Once again, no end market represented more than 20% of our sales for the full year and we remain very steadfast on our belief that this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end market while exposing us to leading technologies wherever they may arrive across the electronics industry. ","So turning to those markets specifically starting with the military market. The military market represented 10% of our sales both in the fourth quarter and for 2017. Sales in the military market rose strongly in the fourth quarter rising by a greater than expected 11%, driven by growth in really most segment of the military market. And that included in particular aircraft, space, naval and communication application. Sequentially, our sales in military increased by a very robust 10%. And for the full year 2017, we were pleased that our military sales grew by very strong 13%, all organic reflecting broad based strength across virtually all segments of the market. ","Our team working in this important market is continues to solidify our leadership position by leveraging our leading technology position amid the more favorable military expanding environment. The breadth of our position is even more important in this environment as we are able to participate on a wide array of next generation military hardware. Looking ahead, while we expect sales in the first quarter to moderate from this fourth quarter level, we do expect to achieve mid single digit sales growth in the military market for the full year 2018. ","The commercial aerospace market represented 4% of sales both in the fourth quarter and for 2017. And sales in the fourth quarter increased from prior year by a robust 11% as aircraft manufactures increased their procurement after several quarters of moderate spending pattern. Sequentially, our sales increased by 7% from the third quarter. For the full year of 2017, our sales were up by 3% as the benefit of Phitek acquisition completed in the first quarter, as well as the strength in large passenger plane volume was offset by continued moderation in demand for both helicopters and business jets. ","Looking into 2018, we now expect the slight moderation in sales from these levels in the first quarter and for the full year we expect the low single digit sales increase as helicopter and business jet procurement volume stabilize and as commercial jetliner production continues to grow moderately. We remain encouraged by the company's strong technology position across the wide array of aircraft platforms in next generation system. And we look forward very much to leveraging that position to expand our overall position in the exciting market for commercial aircraft electronic. ","The industrial market represented 20% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 19% of our sales for the full year 2017. Sales in the fourth quarter grew by a stronger than expected 29% in U.S. dollars and 22% organically. As we benefited from robust organic growth across really nearly every segment of the industrial market but driven especially by strength in heavy equipment, oil and gas, alternative energy and instrumentation. Sequentially, our sales in the industrial market grew by a better than expected 7%. ","For the full year of 2017, our sales in the industrial market grew by a very strong 22% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically. And this is driven in particular by outstanding performance again in heavy equipment and instrumentation, oil and gas and also factory automation, as well as like contributions from the acquisitions that we've made over the recent two years. ","No doubt about it that 2017 was an excellent year for our teams that are working in the industrial market. Through both our successful execution program as well as our organic innovation, we've developed a very broad range of product across a diversified array of exciting segments within the global and industrial market. We are very proud of this success and look forward to realizing the benefits from our efforts in the industrial market for many years to come. And the addition this quarter of CTI and various value add products that come with that acquisition, further strengthens our already robust position in value add interconnect assemblies for a wide range of segments in the industrial market.","Looking to the first quarter of 2018, we anticipate a moderation of sales from current level but for the full year of 2018 we expect to realize mid-teens grown as we continue to benefit from our organic growth efforts together with the contributions from our recent acquisitions.","The automotive market represented 18% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 19% of our sales for the full year of 2017. Sales increased to very strong 22% in U.S. dollar, 16% in local currencies and 12% organically. As we continue to make great progress penetrating a wide array of applications and new electronic systems with car makers around the world. Sequentially, our automotive sales increased by 6%. For the full year of 2017, our sales in the automotive market grew by 16% in US dollars and 11% organically. Another clear reflection of the company's ongoing progress and expanding position across the global automotive market. We are pleased in particular that in 2017 we realized double digit growth in all regions, North America, Europe and Asia. We are continuing to benefit from our long term and consistent strategy in the automotive market of expanding range of interconnect sensor and antenna products both organically and through acquisition to enable wide array of onboard electronic across the diversified range of vehicle made by auto manufactures around the world. We are excited that the acquisitions of Sunpool expand our already growing position in the market for automotive antenna. An area where we can leverage of our industry leading RF technology position together with our broad and balance position with automotive manufactures around the world. ","Looking ahead for the first quarter, we expect sales to increase from current level and for the full year of 2018, we expect to achieve sales growth in the high teens in the automotive. We look forward to continuing to realize the benefits from successful automotive business into the future. ","Turning to the mobile devices market, the mobile devices market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter and 14% of our sales for the full year of 2017. Once again in the first quarter our team just did a great job and our performance in the mobile devices market was much stronger than expected. We grew by a very substantial 69% from prior year as we capitalized on higher volumes of new products in particular related to smartphones as well as accessories. On a sequential basis, our sales grew by a very robust 18% from the already very strong third quarter. For the full year of 2017, we were very pleased that our sales for the mobile devices market increases by 12% from prior year and as you all remember, this is significantly ahead of our expectations coming into the year and even out of the second quarter. Our growth for the year was also driven by growth in smartphones and accessories, offset by declines in the volumes of tablet.","I just cannot emphasis how proud I am of our team working in this important market. As we've discussed last quarter, they have been able to quickly capitalize on unexpected opportunities to expand our position on important new program. And reacting extremely quickly to be able to increase sales by this very significant amount. I can tell you one thing and that our customers remain extremely satisfied to call Amphenol their partner knowing that we are there for them no matter when they need us. The mobile devices market is of course an extremely dynamic and very exciting part of the overall electronics industry. Both the velocity of product introductions and the challenges of ramping the customer requirement creates opportunities for companies like Amphenol that can react with extreme agility to the ever changing environment. This agility coupled with our leading array of interconnect antenna, mechanical and production related products, positions us strongly for the future. ","Looking to the first quarter not surprisingly we expect the sequential reduction in sales of approximately 20% due to the typical seasonality that we see in this market. For the full year of 2018, we currently expect to realize low single digit growth in the mobile devices market. However, we remain ever aware that this market will inevitably perform in unexpected ways and we'll just continue to reminder ourselves that the key to our success is the proven ability of our team to meet and capitalize on any expected opportunities and challenges that arise in this dynamic market. ","The mobile networks market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter and 8% of our sales for the full year of 2017. Sales in mobile networks declined from prior year by a bit more than we had expected 7% in US dollars and 13% organically as mobile operators around the world continue to moderate their spending on network build out. Sequentially, our sales were down only slightly and what is normally is seasonally softer fourth quarter. For the full year of 2017, sales were down in low single digit as the overall spending environment for mobile operators remain muted. Looking ahead and given the uncertainty and the continued uncertainty I should say in the spending plans of wireless operators around the world, we expect sales in the first quarter to moderate from current level. And for the full year of 2018, we do not yet anticipate a recovery in the spending environment and accordingly we anticipate sales to remain roughly at 2017 levels. ","While this year's positive spending was no doubt a challenge for our team to manage, we are very pleased that we have continued to focus on our efforts to designing new products for a broad range of next generation networks including all important 5G network. Thereby positioned the company to benefit when operators' spending does return to growth. Our unique position with both equipment manufactures and mobile service providers create significant long-term potential for the company. ","The information technology and data communication networks represented 18% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 20% of sales for the full year of 2017. As we had anticipated coming into the fourth quarter, our sales were slightly down from prior year as stronger sales of products used in servers were more than offset by a moderation of demand in both networking and storage relating equipment. Sequentially, sales were only slightly down from the third quarter which was actually a bit better than we had expected coming into the quarter. For the full year of 2017, our sales in IT datacom grew by strong 9% US dollars and 6% organically which is really great performance given the overall spending environment, as well as the significant strength that you all recall we had realized in 2016. Our organic growth in IT datacom is a real testament to our team's effort to develop leading technologies while rapidly pivoting for the opportunities for growth created by new customers in this important market. ","Looking into 2018, while we anticipate a normal seasonal moderation of sales in the first quarter, we do expect to achieve low to mid single digit sales growth for the full year. The IT datacom market remains a very exciting place with both traditional and new customers constantly striving to upgrade their equipment to manage the immense expansion of data traffic. This traffic growth continues to be driven by in particular the expansion of video, as well as the broadening of cloud based services. Our team remains at the forefront of efforts to enable this revolution in the IT datacom market. Through their ongoing development of next generation, leading high speed power and fiber optic technologies. ","Finally, the broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 6% of sales in the full year 2017. Sales decrease by 8% in the quarter as operators paused their spending on network build out. On a sequential basis, our sales were down a bit more than expected 14% from the third quarter. While we did realize growth of 5% in the broadband market in 2017 with the contributions from our acquisition, organically our sales were down mid single digit by about 5% in the face of a challenging demand year. Operating spending this year was impacted a number of external factors including in particular the various strategic combinations being considered among customers. Nevertheless, we come out of 2017 very pleased that our product diversification efforts in the broadband market have positioned us very well for the future. ","Looking into the first quarter, we expect sales to moderate from these levels and for the full year of 2018, we currently expect sales in the broadband market to remain at 2017 level. ","So, in summary with respect to 2017, I am just extremely proud of our performance this year. While there remain very dynamics in the global market the Amphenol organization has continued to execute extraordinarily well. In particular, our dual-pronged approach of growing both organically and through our acquisition program has resulted in the company expanding our market positioning while strengthening our financial performance. Amphenol's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages. Our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in diverse market, a worldwide present, a lean and flexible cost structure, a highly effective acquisition program and all of that with the underpinnings of our agile entrepreneurial management team. ","Now turning to our outlook. As Craig mentioned in his remarks as a result of the changes in the US tax law, we currently expect the reduction in our adjusted effective tax rate of at least 100 basis points and we are going to continue to refine this expectation as further implementation guidance is released. On this base and based on continuation of the current market environment, as well as constant exchange rate, we now expect for the first quarter and full year 2018 the following results. For the first quarter we expect sales in the range of $1.780 billion to $1.820 billion and diluted EPS in the range of $0.78 to $0.80 respectively. And again that represents sales increase versus prior year of 14% to 17% in US dollars and 10% to 13% in local currency and an increase versus prior year adjusted diluted EPS of 13% to 16%. ","For the full year of 2018, we expect sales in the range of $7.440 billion to $7.600 billion and diluted EPS in the range of $3.39 to $3.47 respectively. For the full year this represents sales and diluted EPS growth of 6% to 8% and 9% to 11% over 2017 sales and adjusted diluted EPS level. ","We are very encouraged by the continued strong performance of Amphenol in 2017 and we look forward to driving further strength going forward even given the many dynamics across electronics industry. I am confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon these new record levels of revenues and earnings and to continue to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position while expanding our profitability.","And with that operator, we will be very happy to take any questions that there maybe. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","Shawn Harrison","Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Congrats on the strong finish to 2017. The mobile devices business obviously it looks like you gained significant shares, you are able to out execute your peers during the latter half of this year. Are you seeing any expectation that you would see back some of that market share in 2018 or is your expectation that you would more follow kind of market growth of smartphones?","Adam Norwitt","Well, I think to answer a little bit in reverse. I mean market growth for smartphones is not always a great predictor of our performance, as you know there are lots of different factors that go into that market growth. But in terms of our position with our customers, I think we really confirmed to our customers that Amphenol is a very important partner to have and customers are not going to forget that very easily. So I believe that we have really created for ourselves a very resilient position but resilient with the caveat that you are in a market where everything can change all the time. And so I think we've done ourselves a great service. Our customers have recognized that. I believe that we'll continue to have a very strong position but what volumes ultimately will be and how new platforms ultimately gets designed that's always very difficult to predict in this market. ","Shawn Harrison","And then as a follow up. I don't know maybe the word dour is too negative but your view on the mobile networks business seems that way to me. Is there any geographic region that is more negative in 2018 versus 2017? Are you just seeing all global regions challenged?","Adam Norwitt","Yes. I mean I think dour is maybe a little strong word for the guidance. I think we expect it to be for the year kind of flattish for the year which is not quite dour but certainly our performance in 2017 was not what we would have want to come into the year. I wouldn't say that there is in particular one or another geography that sticks out, I think what we see in the mobile networks market is that -- is the dynamic that we have seen many times before when you have both generational changes as well as various corporate goings and coming across the industry which is that -- there is a little bit of a pause and that is the pause that we saw this year. And you'll recall 2016 was a very strong year for us in mobile network, Shawn. And I think this year we saw a pull back in that and we expect that kind of a pause to continue into 2018 in particular as the 5G network as the planning goes on for those. If there is ever an acceleration overall in the plans about various operators or pulling forward in the plans of when to ultimately install next generation network. Well, I can assure you is our team has just done fabulous job of making sure that we are broadly positioned in all geographies. And that's how we've always dealt with this. We've always think about this market as a market where you get sometimes this kind of pent-up demand that materializes over a certain time period, obviously data traffic is not changing, it continues to grow unabated but ultimately when operators choose to make the investments in those next generation network, number one depends on the availability of the actual hardware to enable those networks. Number two, it depends on what's happening with the various corporate ownership of those operators. And number three, it depends on their ability to monetize the increase in the data traffic. I think over the years the operators have gotten better at that last piece which is the monetization of the data traffic but still there is much work still to be done on finalizing these next generation network. Regardless of how it comes out, we've always been there and been ready as to waiting to capitalize on that pent-up demand when it eventually does get satisfied. And I believe long term it will. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. ","Amit Daryanani","Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. Two questions for me as well I guess. Maybe to start off on the tax rate. Craig, you're talking about I think 25.5% tax rate right now but doesn't sound like it's all finalized. So what are the factors that you\u2019re waiting for to get more clarity if you could just maybe call out a couple of those? And then do you think 25.5% is the right tax rate or does it go down from there as you go into calendar 2019 as some of these things get sorted out?","Craig Lampo","Sure. Thanks, Amit. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks Amit and with the current information and guidance available to us, create our best estimate and kind of what we have today. There is a lot of moving part as it relate to the Tax Act. It was just passed 30 days ago, a little over 30 days ago. So there is still a significant amount of interpretations and guidance coming out. I mean there is guidance that came out just Friday of last week that we had to process. So that's kind of what we are referring to in terms of we are still evaluating. I wouldn't point out any one particular thing. There are certain provisions in that that are certainly have some impact on us and other multinational companies. But the one point that's kind of our best guess today based on what we know and we did say at least one point I wouldn't expect less than that. So let's see what happens in going forward as we have more clarity on all of these things that we are expecting hopefully will come out from guidance interpretation perspective. So I'd tell you that I think 25.5% is the right rate to use as kind of we look forward here and I am certainly not going to guess in 2019 and beyond with what might happen there. ","Amit Daryanani","Got it. And I guess Adam just on mobile devices, I think last year maybe prior to that as well when you start off the year and give annual guide, you always kind of start off with a flat expectations for that segment, saying it's volatile to be kind of predictive, which makes sense. What do you see better today that, again, you're not dramatically more positive in that, but you're talking about low single digit growth. So I guess versus the last few years, what do you see sort of different in mobile devices that makes you take a more positive stance and more sort of flat number you typically talked about?","Adam Norwitt","Well, I think if you with Shawn's question I think there is something related to that which is we clearly had a very significant over achievement here in the second half. When we think about our mobile devices business, in the mobile devices market for us second half to first half was up by nearly 90%, I mean that was very, very strong performance by our team and I cannot just emphasize enough how much hard work goes in for that. And through that demonstration of being there for our customers and really supporting them when they needed that support, I think that does create some little bit more favorable view going into the year in terms of where we will be with those customers going forward. Again, with the caveat that I always make that you never know in the mobile devices market. We just felt that coming into this year on the basis of all that we know from our customers that it's a little bit obviously a little bit more favorable outlook than what we've seen over the prior three years. Now, I am not going to tell you I am any more dependable on our outlook on mobile devices. I have been for three years running very undependable in those same three years that you correctly point out, we guided it flat. I was wrong all three years. Fortunately, I was wrong to the upside two out of the three years. And I was wrong to the downside one or other. But-- and we've always tried to guide on the basis of what we see at the beginning of the year, that's the best that we can do here. And I think just this time what we see today sitting here in January is a little bit more favorable than what we've seen in the prior three January.","Operator","Speakers our next question comes from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Mark Delaney","Yes, it's Mark Delaney from Goldman. Thanks very much for taking the question. Congratulations on the strong fourth quarter. As a follow up on mobile devices if I could and certainly understanding there is lot of volatility in that market but generally normal seasonality has sales rise in 2Q and again in 3Q off of a lower March quarter and as you guys are thinking about planning in the year, is your expectation that the build is different than normal seasonality this year?","Adam Norwitt","Yes. I mean it's hard for us to guide for the full year and to guide for our first quarter let alone to give any kind of intelligent and helpful guidance in terms of cadence over the course of those quarters. As you know, we are not very good at that. It's a very difficult market to forecast. I wouldn't say that there is anything terribly abnormal from what we see today but I would be hard pressed to try to paint for you a good picture of what each quarter is going to be sitting where we sit today. ","Mark Delaney","Okay, got it. And then a follow up question on the military segment which I know you did well in the fourth quarter. Given some uncertainty around the US budget and government funding, when you talk to your customers how important is it to get a full year budget in order to achieve that outlook for the full year military revenue growth that the company guided to and is it something that can turn into any of your customer? ","Adam Norwitt","Yes. I mean I think it's really important to have a government that operate effectively and has budget, that's the time that those governments need budget. I remember there was lot of pain that everybody in the military industry went through a time when we were dealing with this bad word, sequestration which you all remember very well. I wouldn\u2019t' say that the current environment is anything like that sequestration. We've been very favorable overall demand in the military market. I think we've done even a little bit better than that when you look at our performance. I think for a full year performance growing 13% organically and not forgetting that the prior year we grew 4% organically and that was including the DLA issue which is year and half ago. Does not having a budget is jumping from CR to CR to CR in the budgeting process; put a damper on the demand for our products. I don't know that we have seen that. I have certainly heard some of our customers in the media talking about how for them it is concerning that there is not a real permanent budget and we would applaud any effort to get a budget done and little back as the military -- military certainly does not like to operate in time of uncertainty. So what is very clear and I think if we look at the change over the recent several years is there is clearly the shift towards the strategic posturing of the military which has more of -- towards building of next generation electronic system to enable our military hardware, both in the US and around the world. And we've seen that just very broadly next generation system new product, a lot of new innovation, upgrades to existing products. I mentioned that we've seen growth in the military market this year really very broadly. If I look at all the little segment that we track in the military market essentially all but maybe one or two of them are up and are up in double digit on a full year basis. And that's everything from communication to ordinance application to vehicles to airframe to naval to space. So we are really pleased that it appears that sort of tilting of the balance maybe away from supporting day to day operating expenses in military and more towards the advanced electronics and advance capabilities that ultimately can be enabled by electronics. I think that's the real favorable environment that our team has been able to capitalize upon. And we are able to capitalize upon that because we've got such a breadth of product and a depth of technologies across the company and across the region in which we operate. So regardless of whether the US kind of hopscotches between these continue resolution, I think we have a good outlook and I don't think that our outlook for the military market is anyway really based on those political soap opera in Washington.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Sherri Scribner","Hi, thank you. It seems like the outlook in industrial and auto sort of those industrial focused market continues to be very strong. You guys have seen excellent growth in those two end markets. And you are guiding to mid-teen to high teens growth in those two segments in 2018. I was hoping if you could give us a little more detail on what you are seeing from an end market perspective? And is that driven by a better economic outlook across the different geographies? And how much of that is coming from organic growth versus non organic growth? ","Adam Norwitt","Yes. So I think just on your -- reverse the question a little bit, both markets we would expect to be kind of high single digit organic growth for the year. And it's very, very strong outlook. I would separate the two in terms of the dynamic in the industrial and the automotive market. I think the industrial market certainly does not have some broad economic tailwind behind it. Even if some of our performance in areas of that market are clearly are outperforming any trends that you see overall. Our strength in areas like heavy equipment and oil and gas, we are happy to have kind of rebounding at this point and things like instrumentation and medical, factory automation. I think not all of those trends are just pure rising tide of GOP lift all the industrial boats kind of trend and if you look at something like factory automation I think here you have a trend that is beyond GDP which is really a shift in places like China and other low cost countries towards automation in order to deal with either lack of availability of labor which we see in many places or increasing cost of that same laboring. Our products are used on a wide array of everything from robots to automation machine that go into this new factories and that's been a real favorable segment for us. I would say that automotive is much more a content growth story of electronics applications continuing to expand in the car. And not necessarily so much just an overall economic trend of automotive. I mean you all know better than I do the general automotive number whether that flat or low single digit or whatever forecast would come. I think for us is less important than the fact that we continue to see just a great proliferation of electronics across car line .And the includes everything from hybrids and electric drive train to next generation emission control to onboard electronics to even kind of autonomous liked application that are going into cars and again creating just great new functionality into demand for new electronic systems which ultimately create a really nice opportunity for our team to work with customers to design in our next generation product. So I'd say that less of a broad GDP economy trend and maybe industrial has a bit more of component of that. ","Sherri Scribner","Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks Adam. And then just looking at the IT and datacom, it seems like your growth outlook for the year is relatively strong considering people's general view of that market low to mid single digit. What's driving that? Is that again from the service side where you commented in some of the cloud business? Do you still see the storage market and the networking market as challenge maybe some more detail on that I think would be helpful? Thank you. ","Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you, Sherri. No, I think we've just established ourselves in the IT market as really the leader in the high technology product for this market and so I think our team with their combination of truly advanced technologies whether that's in high speed and power and fiber optics or the other relevant technologies, together with the dynamics that I have described now here for several years of that quick ability to pivot towards where the new opportunities will be, I think that has given us a really great platform from which we can have this favorable view for the future. It's more of that growth coming from servers or storage or networking or cloud service, I don't know that I would break it down so specifically but I think the trends that we've seen over the recent two years, and we don't see a big change in those trends. Whether is a bit more growth coming out of some of these next generation cloud companies and maybe a little bit less coming out of the more traditional OEMs that building the boxes.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Craig Hettenbach","Thanks. Adam, just question on mobile networks and just the transition to 5G. Just curious kind of what typically your visibility would be into that transition and then once that happened even if it later this year early next year, is there anything to keep in mind from a content perspective or opportunity set for Amphenol? ","Adam Norwitt","Yes. I mean I don't know that we would necessarily have dramatically better visibility than what get publicly announced about who is going to build what network when. I think you've started to hear some prognosis about when certain networks are going to be built. Some of them around Olympic Games, some of them around other events and timing. The question is not when the first network gets build. The real question is when they really start to get build in true volume. And I mean you will remember certainly Craig when 3G, there were plenty of 3G trial network built or certain cities that were built, before you really started to see material levels of demand that were representing significant network build out for that equipment. And so when-- sometime you will see announcement, you will see announcements about certain things being built but that won't necessarily be the real volume increases that could ultimately satisfy this pent-up demand that I spoke off earlier. With respect to the content on 5G, every generation has different architectures, has different content, every vendor who makes this equipment has slightly different approaches to how they design things. I wouldn't characterize 5G is having necessarily different content and what we've seen in 4G or 3G. what I would characterize though very clearly is that the performance requirement of what goes into 5G cell site whatever that is either in the base station or across the site, those performance requirements are clearly going to be higher than what we've seen in 4G. Whether that's the speed or late fee or power consumption and those all areas where we have a really great track record of helping our customers to tackle the thorny problems that come as they are trying to break beyond prior levels of performance. And so does it end up having more or less connectors on one or more or less cable or bigger or smaller antennas that is for us a little bit less important than the degree of technology that's getting embedded into next generation system. And we have no reason to believe that won't be a very advanced technology going into these side pieces. ","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. And then just a quick follow up for Craig. Gross margins down slightly year-on-year, I know you mentioned kind of the cable weakness and that's an element. Anything to keep in mind for a full year 2018 in terms of commodity input cost and how you are thinking about gross margin? ","Craig Lampo","Yes, sure. Thanks, Craig. I think that's right in regard to the full year 2018 in the first quarter. I think that certainly commodities do have some level of impact specifically regarding to the cable segment. We've talked about this when I talked about the reason for the reduction in the profitability in that segment. I mean another thing that actually does have a little bit of impact in the short term but over time we would expect to improve upon it is the impact of our acquisitions that have been done recently over the course of the year. And the acquisitions while they are accretive from an EPS perspective do sometimes have some operating profitability level that are a little bit less than or in some cases some significantly less than our corporate average. And one this is usually happens before we've been able to have them adopt kind of Amphenol operating principle and then get them up to a level. And we saw this in 2016 in a magnified effect when we looked at the full year piece of FCI which we were able to get much quicker than we expected. And that's a little bit what you are seeing in 2018 as you compared to 2017. And over time we would expect to get those acquisitions up to the average of the company and but from a long-term perspective at this 25% conversion margin that we talked about consistently I think that some years could be a little up, sometimes little bit down from that but I think that's still a long -term target that we believe is very achievable. ","Operator","Speakers our next question comes from Will Stein from SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Will Stein","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the good quarter and outlook. I'd like to ask about capital allocation in particular the buyback slowed a little bit in the quarter relative to where it's been recently. Is that related more to the acquisitions that you did in the quarter or is there anything else going on there? Thank you.","Craig Lampo ","Sure. Thanks for the question. As it relate to the buyback, I mean every quarter is a little different in terms of how we allocate capital and I wouldn't say that. I think we actually had a lot of buybacks happening in the first half of the year and first three quarters of the year. And but every single -- 8.4 million shares for the year so I think that and if you look at the whole year I think that's kind of the context I would put it in. I don't think any one particular quarter. I would really focus on from a buyback perspective or nor I would focus on from an M&A perspective piece. That also has certainly its puts and takes from a quarter perspectives. So overall from a capital allocation perspective I wouldn't take that I guess used amount in the first quarter as any change. I think as it relates to the new Tax Act, we really truly believe that the new territorial regime that is now in place under the new Tax Act really provides us with or further enhances our flexibility that we really think is a cornerstone, one of the cornerstones of our capital deployment strategy. We really think balance flexibility and consistency are really the cornerstone of our strategy and we do think the Tax Act really helps with that and supporting that and the ability to more freely move cash as myself and Adam mentioned in our prepared remarks really additionally supports that as well. So in the short term from a capital deployment perspective I think that the flexibility introduced by act will ultimately help us in the long term. It really isn\u2019t going to have so much of an impact I think on our overall deployment strategy giving 50% of our return of capital for M&A with the other 50% going to return of capital to shareholders and any one quarter maybe different. ","Will Stein","Thanks for that. One follow up if I can. It relates to supply chain let say performance or a constraints on the other hand this affects you both I think from a sourcing perspective and also potential from the perspective of your customers and their inventory management. We've heard so much about tightness in the supply chain as it relate mostly to passes but also discrete and then to a lesser degree but more sort of concentrated basis in some ICs. I am wondering what you are seeing in this regard? Any sort of characterization of our current environment would help. Thank you.","Adam Norwitt","Yes. Well, I think relative to supply chain, number one is our team just done a fabulous job and are there certain constraint, we certainly hear about the passes and discrete and some ICs, I wouldn't say that in our company and our universe and our industry we have seen those broad based constraints. There have been some discussions about certain materials like copper and other things like that but obviously our team was able to drive just outstanding results here regardless of any minor constraints that maybe there. Craig mentioned that we have seen some increased cost of certain commodities, and that was reflected most prominently in the margin that we saw in our cable business this quarter. But broadly I would not point to any supply chain constraints and I think certainly none that we are causing and again go back to the ramp up that we were able to drive in our mobile devices market. You look at some of the sequential growth that we are able to achieve also in over the course of this year in our industrial market in mil-aero. So no question that our team was able to deal in that environment regardless whether there were constraints or not. And so I don't think it's impacting Amphenol and it's certainly not impacting our outlook for 2018.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Jim Suva from Citi. Your line is now open.","Jim Suva","Thank you very much and congratulations to you and your team at Amphenol. I have two questions are little bit related so I just asked about the same time. Adam on your outlook for 2018, if you look at it percent basis about the growth of 2018 versus 2017 and you consider that some of the acquisitions were recently announced today so they will help boost the growth rate as well as some of the acquisitions announced previously during 2017 haven't had the full year. It just seems like the growth rate is kind of down shifted from what it has been in the past few years organically. Am I right on that or off on that? Maybe you correct me or help me find logic. And then underscoring that I think Adam you had mentioned mobile devices for Q1 is typically down about 20% and that's what you are guiding too, it looks like in the past was down much more or maybe just kind of close to rounding numbers. Thanks very much. ","Adam Norwitt","Thank you very much, Jim and thanks for your kind word. I mean relative to the outlook and I think specifically you are getting to the organic outlook for the year. I mean we are coming -- our outlook here represents organic growth of 2% to 4% for the year and an overall growth of 6% to 8% for the year. If I just go back in time last January, I think our outlook was 0% to 2% organic growth for the year. And if I look at our organic over last three years and in fact in 2017 we accelerated our organic growth. We had 8% organic growth and in the prior two years our organic growth was a bit more muted but we complimented that with outstanding acquisitions in the year. So I would actually say that our guidance here for 2018 is a very, very robust guidance and it's a great blend in fact of both organic and acquisition contributions and represents a more favorable outlook than we've had really organically for the last three years. So I think that's -- we feel very good about the guidance and about how we are looking into 2018. And relative to mobile, I think, you know that mobile some years Q4 is very strong relative to Q3, other years it's more balanced across the quarter. And so we've seen reductions sometimes of more than 30% in the first quarter for mobile and we've seen other quarter's growth more like this 20%. Is this 20% a little bit on the lower end? It's certainly lower than the 30% we've seen in some other years but it's not uniquely low. I think we've had other years where mobile is down roughly about 20%. But we talked earlier with one of your peer's questions I think we do have a slightly more favorable view of the mobile market sitting where we sit today and maybe part of that is associated with that little bit lower sequentially we find the first quarter. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deepa Raghavan from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Deepa Raghavan","Good afternoon. Hope you are doing well. Adam, question for you on M&A within the industry. Can you comment on how the tax windfall for some US based companies can or cannot change the M&A landscape within the connector space? Also within your M&A pipeline could you talk about a larger -- a potential for larger acquisitions not that FCI is completed integrated? ","Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much, Deepa for the question. I mean relative to the overall M&A landscape and the cash that is maybe available to some companies, I personally would not expect that would have a significant change. And for one reason. It's not that we are now that we have availability and a flexibility that the Craig talked about so eloquently here from the tax reform, it's not that we are going just go change how we think about pricing on acquisition. I believe very much that one should pay reasonable prices for acquisition regardless of what the cost of capital of the moment is because when we make these acquisitions, we are acquiring them for life. At an Amphenol we are not -- we don't view ourselves as a portfolio or manager per se where we buy things and then some day we sell them and we try to market time to buying and the selling of them. We are buying companies on a permanent basis and we know that we are going to be living with the earnings of that company on a permanent basis when the rate environment or the various cost of capital may have changed. And so we are going to remain very disciplined on price. We are very happy to pay good prices for great companies and we are going to continue to take that same approach. And I think as really the acquire of choice in our industry we would maybe set a little bit the trend there as it were. As it relates to our overall M&A pipeline, we continue to have a very robust pipeline. And we are very pleased to have closed on the two deals that we announced yesterday. We have still many more companies that we pursue and follow and stay in touch with and have it various stages of the life of an acquisition if you will. It is there another FCI kind of near and on the horizon that is not something that I would necessarily comment on today. Except to say that we have never had as criteria for our acquisition program size. And so if the right company does come along and clearly there are companies that are of certain sizes in our industry, and if that opportunity were to present itself, we would not be scared away by size. I think that what we look for an acquisition is people number one. We look for great management teams and we've been so successful in accomplishing that goal. We look for fantastic, innovative and enabling technology. And we look for companies with complimentary market position to Amphenol. And if we can fit -- if we can check those three boxes very importantly, whether that is a big company or small company we are going to put our best effort forward in terms of bringing that into the Amphenol family. So we'll continue to work hard at our acquisition program. I think the balance of capital deployment at fragmented acquisition remain really a very high priority if not our highest priority together with investing in our organic growth. And we are going to continue to deploy that capital which as we said has a more flexible availability to it than it had in the past and I am very confident long term we will have great success. We remain unable to predict when those acquisitions will close and when we will get them but I am confident long term there will be good ones ahead. ","Deepa Raghavan","Thank you. That's helpful. Craig, I have one for you. Is it fair to assume SPC-related tax doesn't impact 2018 or going forward? And the reason I asked is your EPS growth guidance is pretty strong at 9% to 11% compared to your historical guide. ","Craig Lampo","Yes. So, Deepa, I think it is fair to assume that we don't have that included in our guidance. We haven't guided to any of this excess tax benefit on our stock based compensation. And the reason for that I mentioned in my prepared remarks and we do really believe that the availability to be able to compare our results especially since the tax benefit is going to be significantly reduced under this new Tax Act is important. There will certainly be some benefit in 2018 based on some level of stock option exercises but the same level of stock option exercise will create significantly reduced benefit because of the new tax regime. So we are certainly not guiding to that and we are not included that in our adjusted guidance, adjusted EPS guidance for specifically that reason. ","Operator","And our next question is from Steven Fox from Cross Research. Your line is now open.","Steven Fox","Hi, good afternoon. Two questions for me please. First just circling back to the acquisition. Adam you highlighted a bunch of attributes for why you bought these two businesses. I was curious from a technology standpoint if there is anything specific you would highlight that brings to portfolio or is this more customer supply chain related? And then I had a follow up.","Adam Norwitt","Yes. I think with the two acquisitions, they are obviously very different. One is value add interconnect assembly company, cable assemblies is the CTI and we obviously know how to do cable assemblies. We have plenty of them across Amphenol. And often times with the cable assembly business you are really looking for different customer channels, different markets, and different presence but at the same time they have fantastic manufacturing technology and really great high value component. And so that's with CTI. I think with Sunpool, we are just really pleased that we get here not only in automotive antenna company, it's very, very important arguably the most important automotive market where the most cars are sold, sold and made. But also a truly vertically integrated automotive antenna capability and that is additive to what we have had in the past. You know that we've been developing organically our own automotive antenna business and we've been very successful with that. But I'd say this really give us a turbo boost in terms of our overall capabilities on automotive antennas from a design perspective of validation, assessing and all the kind of component of making those products, some of which we were able to do before and some of which we are only now able to do with the additional of Sunpool.","Steven Fox","Great, that's really helpful. And then just on the operating margin. So as you highlighted you create the 20% threshold pretty consistently recently. And given the volume outlook you providing, I was curious like how you would sort of quantify that chances of continuing to produce that type of level of margin if you are hitting those volumes. Like what else would hold you back? Whether it's acquisition or raw materials or just seasonality as we think about modeling efforts here. Thanks. ","Craig Lampo ","Sure, thanks. As I mentioned before I mean 2018 is certainly there is some impact from commodities and the cable segment as I mentioned. There is certainly an impact as it relates to the acquisitions that we've done 2017 and we don't project in 2018 for them to be quite up to the level of Amphenol yet. But over time I don't think there is anything that's holding us back since we are at 20% that wasn't holding us back or helping us before we are at 20% level. There is nothing from a leverage perspective that changes anything right now. I think we continue to have a great management team that does a really great job of making sure that their cost in the business are as low as possible given and as flexible as possible in regard to their everyday operation. And these general managers do a fantastic job as they have done before the company was overall at 20% in regards to maximizing the profitability and whether or not they do it out of SG&A or whether or not they do it in the factory or whatever else. We are not really so concerned about that. I think this is an area that we believe that long term we should be able to continue to have that leverage. But in any one year there will be things that will impact it such as the commodities that have had some impact in 2017 in the cable segment and into 2019. And in the shorter term the acquisition that are having some impact which we would expect as we acquire companies that are at lower profitability will have some impact in the future and until we are able to get them up to the Amphenol operating level which we do believe as the management team is clearly possible and certainly targeted. ","Operator","Speakers our last question from the line of Joe Giordano from Cowen. Your line is now open.","Joe Giordano","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Most of -- what I want to ask has been asked but I just wanted to square some of the guides on like mobile network kind of what some of the news flow that you are seeing about post merger kind of just illusion, better CapEx estimate or something, is your guide kind of like what's actually been like were there actual actively procuring right now or is this kind of very short focused on what you are seeing right now or just kind of taking into consideration kind of longer term plans and maybe you are not seeing active in the market quite yet. ","Adam Norwitt","Yes. I mean the way that we build our guidance is really through our internal forecasting process which is based ultimately and what we hear from our customers talking to our sales people. And what we don't do is we don't read the paper and say, well, we think there is a certain trends that maybe coming and we should adjust our guidance accordingly. And if the overall market changes then we would be very happy to be there to enable that higher level of spending. It's not something that we've seen from customers and so our guide in corporate executive what we hear from the customers. We are as helpful as anybody and things like US tax reform or stimuli or overall economic growth around the world can ultimately drive things like infrastructure spending or investments in network or whatever that maybe that can ultimately have a favorable effect on demand for our product. But today what we see and what we hear from our customers is embedded here and what we guided to. ","Joe Giordano","Okay. And then similar on data and devices, I think the plans out of like the hyper scale like the Web 2.0 Company seems to be pretty good as far as datacenter into next year. And how big of a piece of the business is that portion of the market for you guys now? ","Adam Norwitt","Well, I am not going to quantify it but what I said consistently is we've seen just outstanding performance from that. And I think ultimately if you think about the driver of why this demand is increasing. I mean you see just so many opportunities coming the demand for video and the internet, the demand for consumers consuming things in the mobility that they won't otherwise consuming, I mean crazy things I mean now that it appears that there is video game league that are popular than natural sports leagues and people are watching these on their mobile devices, they are streaming them, they are doing all of these. These are all the kinds of drivers that are ultimately create, putting, forcing the data through the network. And as we've seen that shift towards these new web service providers, a lot of the backbone for these new consumption of video is happening through this web service providers, and so we've just -- that has been a real driver of growth and we would anticipate it to continue to be. I will say that as you migrate towards a service provider in terms of their proportion of the market, service providers buy in a very different cadence than do equipment manufacture. And so ultimately that can lead sometime to more volatility. And we saw this quarter in our IT datacom market where in fact in the fourth quarter our sales were slightly down and that's despite having an excellent year going 9% for the full year. But we had had a year before an outstanding finish to the year where we've seen really significant investment in particular in web service providers. So I wouldn't be surprised if there is a little bit more of that kind of operator type service provider type volatility in the IT market for some portion of it. Is it today the dominant part of our IT datacom market? No, it's not. But has it been a real significant driver of growth for that? Yes, no question about it, it has and we would anticipate that going forward. ","Joe Giordano","Just so I understand is the difference in the procurement is one more just like are the cloud guys more willing to do just more in time and hold us inventory than the equipment guys that would lead to that volatility? ","Adam Norwitt","Well, I mean ultimately you are talking about someone who is worrying about running a factory versus someone who is just building thing, building datacenters, getting work crews in the field. And anybody who is involved in actually building network, so whether that's mobile service providers, whether that's broadband service providers, whether that's a internet service providers, the cadence of when you build things is very different than if you are operating factories and you are paying for factory overhead and you want to kind of level low those factories over a certain time period. I mean workers and construction project happen at a very different type of timing than do just factory consumption. Very good. Well, I think that is our final question and again we very much appreciate everybody's attention to us here. And look forward to talking to you all here in three months and again Happy New Year and great continuation here in the first quarter. Thank you very much.

Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the Company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.","Craig A. Lampo","Thank you. Good afternoon. My name is Craig Lampo and I am Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with our CEO, Adam Norwitt. We'd like to welcome everyone to our third quarter conference call. Q3 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends, and then Q&A.","The Company closed the third quarter with record sales and EPS of $1.460 billion and $0.65. Sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of 2014. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the third quarter were up 5%. Sequentially sales were up 8% in both U.S. dollars and organically from the second quarter.","Breaking down sales into our two segments, our Cable business, which comprised 6% of our sales, was down 10% from last quarter primarily due to a slowdown in spending by cable operators as well as the effective currency translation. The Interconnect business, which comprised 94% of our sales, was up 9% from last year reflecting the benefits of good organic growth and the Company's acquisition program, partially offset by currency translation. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.","Operating income increased to $295 million in the third quarter. Operating margin increased to a very strong 20.2% compared to 19.9%, excluding one-time items, in the third quarter of last year. This was a year-over-year conversion margin on incremental sales of 24%. The increase of 30 basis points in operating margins over the prior year primarily resulted from an increase in operating margins in the Interconnect business.","From a segment standpoint, in the Cable segment, margins were 12.5%, which is equal to last year. In the Interconnect segment, margins were 22.3%, up 20 basis points from 22.1% last year. The improvement in ROS reflects excellent operating execution, both organically and from our acquisitions in addition to aggressive cost management.","We are very pleased with the Company's operating margin achievement. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the Company's entrepreneurial management team which continues to foster high-performance action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a market environment which certainly became more challenging as the quarter progressed. Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance.","Interest expense for the quarter was $17 million compared to $21 million last year, reflecting the benefit of the lower average effective interest rate in the quarter and more than offsetting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the Company's acquisition and buyback programs. The lower average rate is a result of the note issuance in September 2014, replacing a higher cost note maturity in November of last year, and the implementation of the new commercial paper program.","Other income was $4 million in the third quarter compared to $5 million last year, and consists primarily of interest income on cash and short term cash investments. The Company's effective tax rate excluding one-time items was 26.5% in both the third quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2014. On an as-reported basis, the Company's effective tax rate was 26.8% in the third quarter of last year.","Net income was approximately 14% of sales in the third quarter of the year, and EPS increased 12% excluding one-time items, which is an excellent performance. Orders for the quarter were 1.44 billion, up 8% from last year, resulting in a book to bill ratio of 0.99-to-1.","The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $285 million in the third quarter or approximately 140% of net income. The Company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income and for the nine months ended September 30 operating cash flow was $708 million or 124% of net income.","From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $888 million at the end of the quarter, approximately equal to June. Inventory days were 80, excluding acquisition impacts, which is down seven days from June levels, as expected. Accounts receivable was approximately at $1.2 billion at the end of September, up approximately 7% from June. And day sales outstanding were 71 days, excluding acquisition impacts, which is down one day from June levels. Finally, accounts payable were $661 million at the end of the quarter, up approximately 18% from June levels. Payable days were 60 days, up five days compared to June levels.","The cash flow from operations of $285 million along with proceeds from the commercial paper program of $94 million and proceeds from stock option exercises of $6 million were used primarily to purchase approximately $52 million of the Company's stock to fund net capital expenditures of $41 million, to fund final payments of $28 million related to previous 2015 acquisitions and to fund dividend payments of $39 million, which resulted in an increase of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $200 million, net of translation.","During the quarter, the Company repurchased 1 million shares under its January 2015 10 million share stock repurchase program. 6.5 million shares remain available under the program through January 2017. At September 30, cash and short-term investments were $1.6 billion, the majority of which is held outside the U.S., and total debt at September 30 was $2.9 billion and net debt was approximately $1.3 billion.","At quarter end, the Company had issued $852 million under its $1.5 billion commercial paper program. In the third quarter, EBITDA was approximately $350 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance.","Before I turn the call over to Adam, I wanted to just make a couple of comments relative to the assumption that we have included in our guidance. The midpoint of sales guidance for the year has been revised from $5.580 billion to $5.488 billion, a reduction of $92 million or 2%. About half of this reduction is due to the weakness in the global industrial market. The remainder relates to moderation in demand in automotive and IT datacom market.","We believe this weaker demand is the result of a higher level of uncertainty in global markets as growing turbulence in certain economies has impacted global industrial demand. This has resulted in increased levels of caution from customers in several of our end markets and has translated into lower demand expectation. Our fourth quarter guidance of $1.330 billion to $1.370 billion in sales or a 6% to 9% sequential decline reflects the impact of these items.","I would also like to note that the majority of the sequential decline in the fourth quarter is driven by the 20% plus sequential reduction in sales in the mobile devices market due to program timing. This is consistent with our previous expectation and results in an annual growth rate in the high single digits in the mobile devices market. Given our current expectation of the fourth quarter sales levels, we are taking appropriate actions to adjust our cost structure.","Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends.","R. Adam Norwitt","Thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to also offer my welcome to all of you on the phone with us here today. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to discuss some trends in the progress across our served markets. I'll also highlight some of our third quarter achievements. And then finally I'll spend some time to comment on our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full-year 2015, and certainly we'll have time for questions at the end.","With respect to the third quarter, I'm just so pleased that we're able to report record results here in the third quarter despite an economic environment that has recently grown even more challenging. We achieved record sales of $1.460 billion, which was an increase of a very strong 7% from prior year in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies. We booked record orders of $1.444 billion with a book-to-bill of just under 1-to-1. And very importantly, we equalled in the quarter our highest levels of profitability that we have ever achieved as we reached an industry leading operating margin of 20.2%. Our record EPS in the quarter of $0.65 grew a very strong 12% also from prior year.","I think Craig elaborated on our cash flow and we're very proud to have generated $285 million of cash in the quarter. I think that cash flow is just a great reflection of the discipline and focus of the entire Amphenol management team. Indeed in this current highly uncertain environment, our organization did just a really outstanding job in the quarter of maximizing performance in the face of substantial challenges that have emerged in the global economy. This is yet another confirmation of the strength of the Company's agile entrepreneurial culture.","Turning to the trends in our served markets, I just wanted to say that we continue to be very focused on driving end market diversification across the Company and once again that strategy has supported the Company's strong performance here in the third quarter.","Turning first to the military market, that market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. Sales decreased from prior year by 3% in U.S. dollars and just slightly in local currencies as distributors' buying patterns became more conservative and as reductions in both communications and avionics applications were not fully offset by growth that we saw in ordnance, engines and rotorcraft. Sequentially, sales in military were a bit softer than we had expected falling by 2%.","As we now look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect sales to increase slightly from these levels and we essentially expect the military market to be flat to prior year for the full year 2015. Amidst the current moderate spending environment, we remain very confident that our broad technology position and expansive participation across a wide array of military programs positions us very well to capitalize on any spending that gets ultimately triggered.","In the context of the modern complex geopolitical environment, military electronics continues to be an enabler for government who are seeking to ensure their own security. As adoption of electronics grows across a broad range of military technologies and as spending increases in geographies around the world, Amphenol remains extremely well-positioned for the future.","The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter and sales in this market were down 10% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currency. We experienced in the quarter a moderation of demand, in particular related to business jets and commercial helicopters, as well as some reduced demand related to some avionics subsystems combined with a little bit of conservatism in the distribution channel related to that. Sequentially, sales decreased by greater than seasonally expected 10% for those same reasons.","While we expect the normalization of demand from both our OEM and distributor customers in the fourth quarter, and thus anticipate a double-digit sequential sales increase from these levels in the fourth quarter, we now expect our sales into this market to essentially be flat in local currency for the full year.","Regardless of that flat outlook, we continue to have an outstanding design and position on the newest commercial aircraft with a broad array of connectors, value-add cable and printed circuit assemblies as well as cable management products. This strong and comprehensive product position creates a great long-term expansion opportunity for Amphenol.","Industrial market represented 16% of our sales in the quarter. Sales fell slightly in U.S. dollars and were up slightly in local currencies. While our sales grew robustly in heavy equipment and alternative energy, that growth was offset by significant declines in oil and gas as well as more moderate reductions in several other segments of the industrial market. Sequentially, our sales fell by 3% in the quarter.","Looking ahead, we have recently seen some more significant reductions in demand expectations of many customers in the industrial market and this appears to in particular result from turbulence in certain emerging economies together with the collective impact of the downturn in commodity prices. Accordingly, we now expect sales in the industrial market to remain at these lower levels going into the fourth quarter.","Regardless of this near-term moderation of our outlook, Amphenol's position across the many segments in the industrial market remains extremely strong and our team looks forward to leveraging our wide array of advanced technology interconnect, sensor and antenna products to drive strong performance in the future in the very diversified industrial market.","The automotive market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. Sales once again increased very strongly from prior year growing 29% in U.S. dollars, 39% in local currency and 13% organically, an excellent performance by any measure. That continued performance in this important market resulted from ongoing momentum of our sales of an ever-growing array of interconnect and sensor products used in automotive electronics, together with the contributions from the Casco and DoCharm acquisitions that we have completed over the last year. Sequentially sales were up just slightly from the second quarter.","While we continue to be very pleased to be out-growing the overall automotive market, we have recently begun to see signs from certain tier customers of a moderation of demand expectations, in particular in China. Accordingly, we now expect a slight reduction of sales in the fourth quarter from current levels. Normally we would see a slight seasonal uptick in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, we retain a very positive long-term view of the automotive market as our broadened product offering of high-technology interconnect and sensor products positions us to capitalize on the continued expansion of automotive electronics for many years to come. I think very importantly, we now have really expanded our reach into and our position with automotive customers around the world, essentially in all geographies.","The mobile devices market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter and sales in this market increased by an extremely strong 40% from prior year and 51% sequentially, as we were able to capitalize on our expected higher levels of production supporting new programs. In particular, we experienced strong demand related to laptop, accessories and production related products in support of customer ramp-up.","As we have previously discussed, we anticipate an approximately 20% reduction of sales sequentially into the fourth quarter as volumes are reduced from the peak demand levels that we experienced here in the third quarter. For the full year 2015, as Craig mentioned, we expect growth to be in the high single-digits.","There is no question that the mobile devices market is among the most dynamic in which we participate. It is really a tremendous credit to our organization that they were able to flex their resources so quickly in reaction to accelerated customer demand and thereby to achieve this excellent performance here in the third quarter. Long-term, we remain confident that our leading technology, our preferred supplier relationships with a broad range of device makers and the excellent track record of execution of our outstanding agile organization positions us strongly for the future in this very exciting market.","The mobile networks market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter and although sales declined by 24% from prior year and 19% in local currencies, we were pleased to see a 5% sequential sales growth in the third quarter and that was driven in particular by some increased demand in North America. Looking ahead, we don't expect any further increase of activity in base station buildout for the remainder of the year of 2015 and in fact expect our sales to be down slightly in the normally seasonally softer fourth quarter.","This has no doubt been a challenging year in the mobile networks market as operators in many regions have deferred their investment plans as a result of a wide array of external factors. Nevertheless, I think we all know that the ongoing demand by consumers for expanded coverage and capacity continues to grow significantly. So given our strong position in the mobile networks market, we remain very confident that with our industry-leading breadth of interconnect and antenna products, we will continue to participate broadly in next generation mobile network deployments as they are triggered around the world.","The information technology and datacom market represented 15% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by roughly 3% from prior year and 2% sequentially as stronger sales in server related products were partially offset by reductions in demand that we saw from networking and in particular storage customers. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, customer forecasts have recently reflected some degree of weakening demand, in particular for products used in storage and somewhat for servers. Accordingly, we now expect our sales to the IT datacom market to reduce somewhat from these levels in the fourth quarter, which normally would be seasonally stronger.","Regardless of this near-term moderation of demand, our position in the IT datacom market remains extremely strong. We continue to make outstanding progress designing in our advanced high-speed and power products into next-generation equipment, and at the same time we are accelerating our penetration of cloud and Web service providers who are rapidly expanding their influence in the IT hardware industry, and we look forward to gaining further momentum in this market long-term.","Finally the broadband market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter and sales in this market were a bit less robust than expected as cable and satellite operators continue to constrain their spending levels with our sales falling about 6% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currency. Sales were up slightly on a sequential basis from the second quarter. We expect sales to remain at or slightly below these levels in what is normally a seasonally slower fourth quarter and we continue to see that many multiservice operators, satellite and telco customers remain conservative in their spending on network upgrades, in particular given the several high-profile industry mergers which either have recently been completed or still pending, together with the significant currency devaluations that we've seen in certain emerging markets, in particular in Latin America, and those devaluations are also constraining spending.","Nevertheless, we remain confident that we will realize long-term success in this market, primarily due to our proven capability to create innovative solutions for our customers in support of the rapid growth of high-speed data delivery. As we drive further efforts to create these enabling technologies, we look forward to maintaining our leading position in the broadband market.","So just a final word here on the third quarter, I just want to say I'm extremely proud of our organization as we once again executed very well in the third quarter despite a heightened level of economic uncertainty and a very dynamic market environment. Our continued strong performance here in 2015 is a clear reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in diverse markets, our worldwide presence and a lean and flexible cost structure. Above all these strengths though, our greatest asset remains Amphenol's agile entrepreneurial management team who reinforces that high-performance culture every day and in particular who excels in times where markets are more uncertain.","Now turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2015, as Craig and I have already mentioned, we have recently seen increased signs that turbulence in certain economies have begun to impact the outlook for global industrial production, and that has resulted in a moderation of our sales expectations in particular in the industrial, automotive and IT datacom market.","Based on these conditions and assuming that exchange rates remain stable at current levels, we now expect in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2015 the following results. For the fourth quarter, we now expect sales in the range of $1.330 billion to $1.370 billion and EPS in the range of $0.58 to $0.60 respectively. This represents a sales reduction from prior year for the fourth quarter of 4% to 7% in U.S. dollars and 2% to 4% in local currency and an EPS reduction of 5% to 8%.","For the full-year 2015, we now expect sales in the range of $5.468 billion to $5.508 billion, an increase of 2% to 3% in U.S. dollars, 6% to 7% in local currencies and 1% to 2% organically, and we expect EPS for the year of $2.38 to $2.40, an increase of 6% to 7% over 2014 excluding one-time items.","As Craig alluded to, our team is of course reacting very quickly to adjust resources in the face of this reduction in our outlook for the fourth quarter. We remain singularly focused as an organization on reacting quickly to changes in the market environment while continuing to pursue the many opportunities for expansion that are still present in the global electronics industry. In fact, it is really in challenging times like these that the unique agility and drive of the Amphenol management team is most important, and with that I remain extremely confident in the ability of that outstanding team to continue to capitalize on opportunities to grow our market position and achieve superior profitability and thereby to drive continued strong performance for the Company through the remainder of 2015 and beyond.","With that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there may be.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question came from the line of Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amit Daryanani","Two questions from me. One, I guess Adam, could you just talk a little bit more on the industrial markets in terms of when did you start to see the softness in the quarter, and when I think about the guide, Adam, it's sort of flat sequentially in December quarter, that doesn't seem overly conservative in my head, so maybe talk about the comfort level you have that things don't get worse from what you saw in September within that industrial bucket?","R. Adam Norwitt","I think with respect to the industrial market, I think what we certainly saw is really more recently towards the end of the quarter and even coming here into October is when we started to see some expectations from customers being revised downward. I think that we continue to have an outlook in the industrial market that is kind of flat but we used to have an outlook that is going up in the quarter, and that's why the change in our guidance. We had a lot of expectations from customers of actual growth going into the end of the year which now we don't see happening.","In terms of the conservatism of that, I think we have taken due prudence in looking at the expectations from our customers and we feel confident in the number that we have now given, otherwise we wouldn't be giving them obviously, but I think that we continue to perform in the industrial market very well. Last quarter we continued to really expand our market position but not at the levels that we would've thought coming into the quarter.","Amit Daryanani","That's helpful. And then I guess just in the mobile devices side, you did somewhat better than you guys thought obviously in the September quarter, and it's going to be down 20 in December, I'm just curious, how do you think of seasonality as you get into the March quarter? I don't want to get too far ahead but is that essentially you're pulling your seasonal so March should not be down as severely anymore, how to just think of that segment, and then did you have a 10% customer this quarter?","R. Adam Norwitt","I think just with respect to the third quarter, the trajectory that we saw in the market was maybe a little bit better in the third quarter than we thought but in general the trajectory that we're seeing here in the second half is what we have expected to see. I think it's still premature to talk about what we would see in the first quarter and I think it's still premature to talk about the nature of which customers we have at what percentage at this time.","I think the reaction of our team here in the third quarter is something that I think is just so important to emphasize. When we see that we were able to grow the sales by the amount that we were able to grow, and you can imagine on the flipside going down by 20% here in the fourth quarter, you remember last year or this year in the first quarter our sales were down by 30%, I think it is just a really great testament to the organization that they were able to capitalize on the upside that we knew was coming in this case and adjust to the variations in that market going into the fourth quarter, and whatever the first quarter will bring, no doubt about it the team will maximize performance and also ensure a secure bottom line going into the first quarter.","Operator","The next question came from the line of William Stein of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","William Stein","Adam, I just want to synthesize some of your comments and relative to the last question, when you say that, I forgot exactly what the wording of the press release and the comments were, but I want to distinguish bookings from billings, am I correct in looking at or reading everything that we've read and listening to the call that it's bookings that sound like they eroded more in the September month and into October as well, is that sort of the linearity we should think about for bookings?","R. Adam Norwitt","I think it is a little tricky to look at bookings and how do bookings reflect on the subsequent quarter, in particular when you have such a strong mobile quarter. As you may recall, our mobile business essentially books as it ships. So it's not a book to ship kind of a business, and so in a quarter like the third quarter where we did have a very strong sequential growth in our sales for mobile, the bookings in fact followed and we had a book to bill in the quarter of just under 1-to-1.","What I would say is that as we went through the quarter, that 1-to-1 got a little bit less into September and into the expectations that we saw here in October. And so I think from that standpoint, the trajectory during the quarter clearly at the end of the quarter, that 1-to-1 ratio eroded somewhat and that was one of the signals of the expectations of demand from the customers going to the fourth quarter.","William Stein","That's very helpful color, Adam. And then maybe one more on the automotive end market, we've seen some weakening data from China in the earlier part of Q3 but much more recent data has been more positive in response to a stimulus presumably in China, and I'm wondering is this lag that we're seeing, what looks like a lag in your business where you had strong Q3, Q4 outlook is weaker, do we take that as just a normal lag through the typical direct supply chain or is this a lag because of distribution or is there some other explanation, and thanks very much?","R. Adam Norwitt","I think that as you termed it, weakening from China, I've said before even if our business in China has grown significantly from where it was, in Asia has grown significantly from where it was before, we're still not a great bellwether for what is happening in China. I think that we have started to see, as the quarter drew on, some pullback in demand from customers in Asia and in China specifically.","Is there a lag due to normal direct supplier versus distribution, what I can say is we don't do a lot of sales through distribution in the automotive market globally and that includes also in China. What is the kind of lag through the various tiers because we're not selling in general directly to automotive OEMs, you can imagine that there could be some lag there.","I don't know, there has been a lot of talk of the recent stimulus in China and the reduction of VAT taxes on certain things and what does that translate into, what types of cars, what types of OEMs are benefiting from that, I mean that can all have some impact. Then I think again our position is not as broad as to say that we're a perfect reflection of what's happening in China. What we see from our customers just of late has been some reduction in the expectations that we would've had.","Traditionally the Chinese market, and we're just getting to know the Chinese automotive market a little bit, it tends to be more of a second half loaded market than does the rest of the worldwide automotive market which tends to be more of a first half loaded market, and I think that where you normally would have seen a buildup towards that higher levels demand, I think maybe you see a little bit less of a buildup towards those higher levels of demand even if the demand is not necessarily falling off but it may only be a kind of a flat end demand. That's one theory that one could ascribe to that, but again we are not a great representation of the totality of the Chinese automotive market.","Operator","The next question came from the line of Mike Wood of Macquarie Security Group. Your line is now open.","Mike Wood","First question just on auto segment, relatively a slight decline seen in global auto production over the past few months, and it looks like you're pointing to a low single digit growth ramp on that segment in the fourth quarter, at a much narrower content expansion than we've seen in the past. Curious if there's something in there that's kind of making it look smaller than you've typically seen or is this just what may be now normal from a content expansion in that segment?","R. Adam Norwitt","I think what's implicit in our guidance for the fourth quarter is kind of a high single-digit local currency expansion of our prior year. I think we just had a fabulous quarter in automotive, 13% organic growth, 39% in local currency in the third quarter, and I think we continue to outperform the overall automotive market and we continue to have a conviction that we will continue to outperform the automotive market overall.","What is growth in units versus what is growth in content versus what is growth in Amphenol, I think that will remain to be seen in the coming year and years to come but our position continues to expand, we continue to leverage the acquisitions that we've made as well as the organic developments that we've made, and we certainly feel that our ability to expand and the room for us to continue to expand in that space is not limited at this stage.","Mike Wood","Great. And as a follow-up, the resources just that you discussed in your prepared remarks, would that take time to fully be implemented, should we expect it in the first quarter to sort of all flow through in incremental margins?","R. Adam Norwitt","I think that we always take very quickly action in Amphenol when we see demand changes, and I think for those who follow the Company for many cycles, you know that that doesn't take us to sit back and wait for kind of a news headline that says things are bad, we look case by case across our 90 operating units and as we see demand decline or demand expectations decline from customers, we take immediately action.","And so there's not necessarily a lag from when we start to see it to when we start to take action. We take the action right away and we do that action in order to secure our conversion margins going into that time, and I think if you look at our guidance here in the fourth quarter, it's a very strong guidance from a bottom-line standpoint and I think that is reflective of our normal operating approach which is to take quick action in the moment as soon as we're seeing the problems from customers.","Operator","The next question came from the line of Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Your line is open.","Matt Sheerin","So just following up on that question, Adam, regarding your approach to taking cost at the operating level, obviously reacting to near term order trends, but as you look and obviously visibility into the Q1 is going to be tough here, it seems like we're seeing a bit of a pause from customers, and typically getting into the December quarter it's very backend \u2013 sorry, front-end loaded, so do you get a sense at all that this is a pause and you may start to see end markets like industrial and auto where you typically see things pickup in March, that you may get signs that we will see that following a pause or will you continue to take cost as though it's going to flat-line here and be weak for a while?","R. Adam Norwitt","I think we don't bet on the future when we see this. I think that's just a hallmark of the Company. So we are not guessing where Q1 is going to go for example in the industrial or in the automotive markets. We're taking the action in what we see today and we do that in a very prudent but also a very aggressive fashion, and that's something that we do if we think that it's a one quarter or a two quarter or whether that is a significant downturn in the economy, we try not to differentiate because once you get into the business of making cost reductions by guessing where the future is going to be, you never make them in a timely fashion, and that has always been for us a principle that we follow regardless. Whether that's a one quarter, a one month, a two quarter or a one year, we believe in our Company that you got to take those actions quickly and then you get out in front of customers rapidly to make sure that you're driving incremental sales and expanding your market position.","If you end up in a situation where that is a longer time period, you are ahead of the game and you're out there with customers already while your competitors are sitting in conference rooms trying to solve the restructuring that they are trying to do. That's just not how we approach these matters, and I think the fact that we do that with these 90 general managers around the world, it's not a big thing. We're not sitting here at headquarters saying, all right, what percent of headcount do we take out, we're talking 90 times to 90 GMs and several of those have some different expectations than they used to have, well, what are you doing about it? It's a very simple, straightforward thing. And most of the time we don't even have to ask, they've already done it and we just get to them and we have a confirmatory discussion that yes, we did what we needed to do and let's move on and get some orders.","Matt Sheerin","Okay, that's helpful. And just regarding the mobility business, I get the guide after a very strong September quarter, but you understand that smartphones is a chunk of your revenue there but obviously you're doing wearables, notebooks, tablets, could you go through some of those sectors and talk about performance, how you're positioned there and how you're seeing demand trends?","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure. Look, I think we have a very strong position across the mobile devices market and I pointed out that in this quarter we especially saw strength from a lot of next-generation laptop products which have become much more connected devices now. I think everybody is seeing that there was this kind of wave of tablets that came over the last three, four years and there seems to be now kind of a back to the future here on October 21 of 2015, back to the future to the laptop where the laptops are becoming more an integral device and I think we've spent a lot of time making sure that we're well positioned on these next-generation products.","In addition, we've gotten a lot of progress on accessories and accessories everything from wearables to smart devices and there's a whole kind of range of things that you can't really put into a category anymore. And I think we talked last quarter about the fact that in addition to that we have worked with customers on \u2013 working with them in their production ramp-ups and helping them with products that can support their quick ramp-ups, and I think across the board we are working in every opportunity with customers in the mobile devices market and they really rest on kind of two pillars.","One is that we continue to please our customers and not disappoint our customers from the standpoint of technology and we continue to exceed their expectations in terms of execution, and in that market that ability to execute time and time again when they need you is something that means they keep coming back for more regardless of what the product is, what the end product is, what our product is that we're selling, and that's something that we continue to emphasize strongly with our team and I think ultimately was one of the reasons we were able to perform so strongly here in the third quarter.","Operator","The next question came from the line of Jim Suva of Citi, Your line is now open.","Jim Suva","Congratulations to you and your team at Amphenol. Two questions, and I'll give them both kind of at the same time. First of all on the mobility side, and maybe my numbers and memory is a little inaccurate or old, I had thought that this quarter mobility was going to be up kind of close to say 40%-ish due to seasonal, and I think I heard you say maybe it was up 50%. So it sounds like was that stronger than what you thought, and then for the full year you had mentioned unchanged, does that mean kind of the decline for Q4, coming down a little bit bigger or does it take up the full year up a little bit more? Then my second question is, I believe Amphenol recognises sales on sale into the assembler, so a large OEM when they place orders, is it truly based upon your reduction in your forecast upon end market demand or is there inventory buffer that we can think about or is it like a multi-quarter adjustment, just trying to get a feel on this recent slowdown doesn't have a multi-quarter impact due to both the assembler as well as the end product?","R. Adam Norwitt","I think with your first question with respect to mobile devices, we expected sales to be up sort of approximately 40 or a little bit more than 40 and they were a little bit better than that. I think you're correct in pointing that out. And maybe the fourth quarter is a little bit worse but it's not meaningful compared to what the other things that we talked about.","I think that relative to your question about timing, we obviously recognize our sales when we sell them to the person who places the order to us, and the person who places the order to us is sometimes the OEM if they are building it and sometimes it's the contract manufacturer if they are building it. In many cases we deal with contract manufacturers in particular in the markets that are more related to information technology, communications market and whatnot.","Is there an inventory buffer, is there an inventory correction? We don't have great visibility into the inventories of that supply chain. We have about 11% of our sales go through distribution in the quarter and I think there we have some degree of inventory visibility, but relative to our sales that go into contract manufacturers across the communications market, there I can't tell you that we have a good read on what their inventories are. We know only what you know through publicly available information, and is that representative of an inventory correction or an inventory buffer, I think it's hard for us to say at this point.","Operator","The next question came from the line of Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Craig Hettenbach","First question, any update on the timing expected for the FCI transaction?","R. Adam Norwitt","No, I don't think we have any news to report on that. As we talked about last time, we would expect that the deal would close by the end of the year. We are still in the regulatory approval process and have regulatory approval processes essentially now in the hands of the China antitrust regulators. As I think all of you know, that is a real black box in China. We are doing everything that we can to expedite it but it is not something that is necessarily easy to predict. To the extent that there any news or update comes, we certainly would let everybody know. At this time, we don't have any reason to think that it's any different, although that it remains in that black box.","Craig Hettenbach","All right, and then just a follow-up on M&A more broadly and just thinking through the pipeline, anything to be said in terms of periods of disruption like we're seeing now or when demand comes in, do you see there will be opportunities to be more opportunistic or how you're seeing the landscape for M&A as you go into 2016?","R. Adam Norwitt","Look, we are very pleased with our M&A progress this year. We have closed three deals, we have announced the fourth, we continue to have a really great pipeline of acquisitions that we are pursuing and we continue to have great availability to pursue those acquisitions financially. Does one quarter of a little bit of economic uncertainty create a different dynamic in the market for acquisitions? I don't think so. I mean when we look back over time periods that were even more severe than this, 2009 or others, the fourth quarter of 2011, it's not that sellers miraculously stand up and say, I'll sell my company to you quicker or cheaper, that's just not the dynamic that we see.","We deal with very patient sellers and we're a very patient buyer and we take a very long-term approach to these things, and so it's either corrections in the equity market or uncertainty in the overall economy, that doesn't tend to drive acquisition activity any differently for us. If you look over the years, we have had years which are very strong economic years where we have done lots of deals, we have had other years where we've done fewer deals and the same can be said of less strong economic years.","So I would not anticipate that there will be any meaningful change to the dynamics, but what I would just emphasize again is we have a very strong pipeline and an outstanding track record here of being the acquirer of choice in this industry, and as we look out over the interconnect and now the center industry for acquisition opportunities, we remain very confident that we will find more acquisitions for the long-term.","And I think I would just add here, acquisition for the Company is a real organic capacity that we have. There's some years where our acquisitions will be at about that target that we have of generating about a third of our sales growth and there are other years where it can be more or less. I think what you see this year with our current guidance that at the high end of guidance or at the midpoint we'd be somewhere 6%, 7% growth in local currencies and acquisitions would make up a little bit more than half of that in this year. We've had other years where they've made up a little bit less than that. But I think overall it's the combination of the organic growth that we achieved together with the acquisition growth that ultimately creates great value for the Company and allows us to continue to expand our position with customers across the many markets that we serve.","Operator","The next question came from the line of Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Sherri Scribner","Adam, I just wanted to ask on the fourth quarter, your commentary on the different sections almost seem to suggest that we're seeing moderation and caution almost across the board throughout most of your segments. I think in all of the commentary for 4Q you've guided to relatively flattish or slightly down, obviously with the exception of the devices market. I know you called out industrial, automotive and infotech and data as being particularly weak, but I was hoping to get some additional granularity on what you're really seeing in terms of where the weaknesses is coming from, is it coming mostly from commentary from the [indiscernible], is it specifically U.S.-based, is it Europe based, any additional commentary on sort of what you're seeing would be helpful?","R. Adam Norwitt","I think you're correct in one sense which is we do see slight changes across many of our markets. I think what both Craig and I talked about those, that the predominance of the change that we see and the change that's reflected in our guidance at the midpoint is really coming, roughly half of that coming from industrial and the remainder coming from auto and IT datacom, not to say that we don't see small changes in the others and I think you're correct in saying that more of those are negative than are positive, and that's the reflection of this overall market environment which as we've said appears to be more uncertain now than it was before. I talked about the fact that in automotive for example we see more of a reduction in expectations coming out of China. So that clearly has some geographical influence to it.","As it relates to the industrial market broadly, there's no doubt about it that China and other emerging geographies, there has been some sort of step-down in the expectations or in the actual growth that is occurring in those markets, and that has kind of a knock-on effect across the industrial market. And whether that is in things like heavy equipment or whether that is in areas like medical or oil and gas, there's no doubt that that feels like it is a little bit of a broader geographical spread of where our customers are but the origin of where that uncertainty comes, may come more from those emerging markets as kind of the trigger to that weakening that we've seen in the expectations of our industrial customers.","And I think the IT market is not wholly unrelated to that either, in that when you see an emerging market, some reductions, typically the IT market has a very strong fourth quarter that tends to be seasonally the strongest quarter as budgets flush and other things happen, and I think the moderation that we've seen there can also be somewhat linked back to that overall economic sense that may have started in emerging markets that says that maybe there's not going to be that pop-up spending coming here at the end of the year and those places \u2013 and then that has a carryon effect through the overall market.","So I think that if you want to pin it on a geography, I wouldn't pin it specifically on one country like China or Brazil or Russia but there's no doubt that collectively across emerging markets there appears to be a less sanguine view of demand going into the fourth quarter.","I mentioned also in my prepared remarks relative to industrial that the downturn in the commodities market has obviously been very severe, everybody is well aware of what has happened there, and I think there have been some well-reported knock-on effects of that across the industrial market and what that means for equipment and all of that. One could even look at something like oil and gas and draw a link to helicopters where we've seen a reduction in our commercial air and particularly in helicopters which was an important growth part of that, where the largest single purchaser of commercial helicopters is in fact the oil and gas industry and you can bet that they are purchasing a few less helicopters these days than they were.","So I think there are some linkages from that that have some of those knock-on effects that you alluded to, but to find just one golden goose here in terms of what's causing that, that I wouldn't be able to do.","Sherri Scribner","Okay, I think those comments were helpful. So thank you for that additional color. I also just on the automotive market, that's been a strong growth driver for you over the past couple of quarters, can you talk a little bit about what you saw in the quarter in terms of auto production and what you're expecting for 4Q given that things are softening a bit and what's the outlook longer-term?","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure. I think we have never tied too much our results to just unit production, and I think that's very simply put because we see the opportunity to grow in the electronics in the car, we see a lot of electronics growing and we continue to outperform unit production just growing last quarter organically by 13%. Clearly that's well in advance of any unit production numbers that have either come out or expected to come out at this stage.","So I wouldn't tell you that we have a good view on what units are going to do here in the fourth quarter. This is not where we focus on. I think we focus on servicing our customers at the various tiers of the automotive industry, and based on the information that we've gotten from them going here into the fourth quarter, we have adjusted our expectations accordingly, but I don't think we're a good read on what is the unit going to be in the automotive market.","Operator","The next question came from the line of Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Shawn Harrison","First question, I just wanted to I guess the trends in the IT markets that you're seeing, the incremental weakness, is there any reasons to suggest that that's also not affecting the FCI business, so when that comes onboard, the revenue run rate that was highlighted at the time of the acquisition announcement is maybe a bit lower or a bit more challenged to growth dynamics?","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure. Look, I mean, I think that what we see in the IT datacom market is probably not different from what others will see in that market, and then FCI being another player in that market, would they see some of that? That may very well be. I think the fact is we don't buy FCI for just their performance here in a quarter or two, we acquire that company with a long-term view that is a very positive long-term view of the benefits that come from the combination of Amphenol and FCI, and if there's something happening in the market in either the short-term or the medium-term, that doesn't change at all our expectations for the company nor our confidence that that's a great thing for Amphenol.","Shawn Harrison","Okay. And then as a follow-up, I know it's tough to ask you to look out into 2016 and use a crystal ball, but are there end markets where you expect growth to be challenged or maybe potentially limited and no organic growth in 2016 given the trend you're seeing currently?","R. Adam Norwitt","Look I think the crystal ball is not easy to exercise right now. I think we have just taken our expectations down here in the fourth quarter and I've talked a lot about why that is. What is that going to turn into as the calendar page turns into January, it's too early to say what that would be. I think that I mentioned in each of the markets those areas where we see that the Company still has great potential and great position, and as we look into next year, will there be some markets that will perform better than others and others that will perform worse than the rest, no doubt about it. I mean that's the beauty of the diversification of the Company. I think at this stage though it's too early to give kind of a prognosis about what may be starting here on January 1.","Shawn Harrison","Fair enough, thanks as always.","Operator","The next question came from the line of Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is open.","Steven Fox","Adam, just first question real quick, I know you've given a lot of color on the markets, but when you think about the different distribution channels that you have cited as maybe showing some weakness, are there any that you would say were over-inventoried or would you say it's a fairly good reflection of demand, any color there will be appreciated?","R. Adam Norwitt","I think we may have seen some slight inventory adjustments in the quarter in a few of those. I mean the areas where we have more distribution is industrial, commercial air and military. Those are the three markets where we have the most distribution presence. We have some limited distribution presence in others. But I think there was also sell-through. We certainly saw on the sell-through side that orders at sell-through and that limited visibility that we have across that 11% of our sales, were certainly started to moderate as the quarter went on. And so I don't know that there was significant inventory movement at that stage.","Steven Fox","Okay, great. And then just specifically on the auto expectation, just relative to what the Company was thinking 90 days ago and now, I guess it will be interesting to sort of understand how much maybe was sort of Amphenol specific on where you had expected maybe programs to ramp that are delayed, whether they were mid-model upgrades or new models, et cetera, and how much was just pure unit demand, if there's any way to sort of provide color on that, it'd be appreciated?","R. Adam Norwitt","I think the best I can say is virtually all of the changes that we've seen in the automotive market appear to be just generalised forecast reductions from customers. These were not due to program delays and certainly not due to losses of business that we had. That was just overall forecast coming down from customers.","Now forecast can come down because of units, they can come down because of take rates, they can come down because of mix of units and the types of cars that are there. I think I mentioned in China for example that there is \u2013 while it's true that there are various stimulus programs that people have talked about, there's also some talk about the mix of cars and whether those are higher content or lower content cars that are being stimulated in China.","That's one example maybe of an area where even if units are at a certain level, if the overall mix of the size of the cars and of the feature sets of those cars is different, that would naturally have some impact on us in the short-term. So I think that we certainly would not point to anything where we were losing or where there was a delay per se, it's just the forecasts are coming in lower.","Operator","The next question came from the line of Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Mark Delaney","First question was on M&A, I was hoping you could clarify if you closed any acquisitions in either the third quarter or quarter to date that you can point to. And then related to that, if you could just update us on the M&A landscape, and I know there's been some discussion on the topic already but if you can talk about the potential size of acquisitions that may be out there and just given that Amphenol is now a much larger company than it has been historically if there's either enough small deals or larger deals that are potentially available that can move the needle and still support the overall revenue growth as it has in the past?","R. Adam Norwitt","No, we didn't close any deals in the quarter or announced any deals in the quarter. We certainly would let to know when and if we do. I did mention we have already closed three deals so far this year and we have signed another one, the FCI deal, and I think we feel very good about the M&A landscape. We have made over the last five years I think some 22, 23 acquisitions, maybe 25, Craig reminds me, and we have a really fabulous execution ability on those acquisitions.","You asked a question, as the Company grows in size, how do we balance small deals versus larger deals? I think we have demonstrated how we do that. We continue to strive to find unique entrepreneurial kind of tuck-in acquisitions and we have a strong appetite still for those companies, and in the second quarter we acquired DoCharm and ProCom, both just really outstanding companies in their respective fields, and those are great acquisitions in that they bolster our capabilities either in a certain technology, in a certain region, with a certain set of customers.","At the same time we continue to make larger deals and I think we announced the FCI deal. It was just a year ago September that we made the Casco acquisition, a year prior to that that we made the Advanced Sensors acquisition. So I think we have continued to find large sized transactions which can kind of move the needle at the same time as we continue to prosecute a great pipeline of tuck-in acquisitions, and we would view that very much the same going forward.","The Company has just a great track record of M&A and our financial strength enables that, at the same time as our organizational structure and our culture enables us to assimilate those companies very smoothly, and I think that's a great advantage for the Company going forward.","Mark Delaney","Thank you for those comments. And then for follow-up on the mobile networks market, I know 2014 was a very strong year on those, lots of build-outs, and so this year is partly impacted by some of the consolidation that's going on at the customer base and tough comps and maybe inventory reductions, I was hoping you could just kind of comment what your customers are suggesting this business can be at over the intermediate-term and is there still growth potential from further LTE build-outs as we go forward or should we expect lower growth to continue in mobile networks as we start thinking into 2016?","R. Adam Norwitt","Look, I am obviously not a great forecaster of growth in mobile networks having taken our expectations down twice already this year, both at the end of the first quarter and the end of the second quarter, and we do see today, even if we grew in the third quarter on a sequential basis, we don't expect further growth here in the fourth quarter. I think it's safe to say that our view and the industry's view coming into this year was a more positive view of the mobile networks market than ultimately we think it's going to end up.","And the reasons for that have been well written about, whether that is the digestion of last year's outstanding investments that were made, whether that's the variety of mergers and corporate combinations that have either been talked about or signed or executed upon, and there's also other kind of extraneous things that have happened, for example in China with the anticorruption investigations that have gone on and by all accounts have deferred some of the spending there.","So what does that mean going into next year, I think it's very hard to give a prognosis at this stage, but I think what's very clear is that this is a market that is ultimately driven by consumer demand, consumers who are consuming more and more video on their devices, who are using their devices as kind of a replacement for their desktop, for their television, for their home computer, for their work computer. So as mobile devices become essentially the linchpin around which we revolve our technology live, I know personally that I just got a text message two days ago I was not so happy about when my kids blew through my huge monthly data plan and I had to pay another $15 three days ago.","So there's no doubt about it that I don't think I'm the only one blowing through my data plan every month on my family shared data and there is a huge demand, growth in demand for data in the mobile networks market. How does that ultimately manifest itself in the spending, in the capital spending of the wireless operators around the world? That is a timing that is very difficult to give a prognosis on.","I think we saw in the third quarter some incremental strength from North America and we are very pleased to be well-positioned for that. We have not seen that strength in places like Europe and Asia. There's been some signs of strength in India as an example. That's a market that we haven't seen a lot of strength in for three, four, five years. So I think for us the most important thing is that we are well-positioned and we continue to grow our position in all the places. When the spending comes, we'll be ready for it, we'll be well-positioned and we'll be the first phone call for our customers.","Operator","Our final question came from the line of Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.","Wamsi Mohan","Adam, I was just wondering with all the consolidation in the IT datacom space, do you see this ultimately as a market with an overall shrinking TAM for Amphenol as hardware moves to more commoditized platforms and companies move more to cloud-based deployments, and how do you think about the R&D deployment as it pertains to this end market and investing in like high-speed backplane connectors?","R. Adam Norwitt","I think the simple answer is, we don't think of that as a shrinking TAM, Wamsi, but we do think of it as a changing TAM and we've talked a lot about that. There is no question that the consolidation is a reflection of a lot of changes in that marketplace. What used to be OEMs who would make boxes, put them and ship them to customers who needed some IT hardware, that has really changed and is in the process of flipping on its head. It's a slow flip, how that happens, that change towards the Web service providers and others, some of whom have taken it upon themselves to design and spec out their own equipment, but it is no doubt an enormous change in that market. It's actually a very exciting change for a company who can get on top and ahead of that, and I think that's something that we have really positioned ourselves to do.","The reality is, if we look last quarter in the IT datacom market, we grew in local currencies about 4%, organically also about 4% last quarter, and I could tell you that a good portion if not all of that growth came from expansions that we've seen in sales to non-traditional customers. And so we continue to expand our position with these non-traditional customers in the IT datacom market on a global basis, and I think that as that settles out over time, we will have a great position there and whether that's in high-speed backplane products, whether that's in power products, whether that's in high-speed cable assemblies and I\/O connectors and fiber optics, we have a wonderful product offering there that can service customers regardless of what part of the supply chain that they are in. No doubt about it, it's a changing TAM, but I would not say at all that that's a shrinking TAM long-term.","Wamsi Mohan","Thanks Adam. And just to follow-up on your comment, would you say the non-traditional buyers have similar margin profile on your products relative to the traditional players?","R. Adam Norwitt","Look, I mean we make good money on all what we sell. I think that I would not differentiate between them in terms of the potential. Ultimately, margin is related to how much value you can deliver to your customers, and I can tell you that customers across the IT datacom market have enormous needs for new technologies, and to the extent that you can enable their new technologies and their needs with your new technologies, then ultimately they are willing to pay a fair price, not a higher price, a fair price, and then it's incumbent on us to get our costs in the right position such that we can make money on any business that we participate in.","Very good. I think, operator, it appears that that's our final question. At this time, Craig and I would like to once again thank all of you for your time today and we look forward to speaking to you again here in about three months. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for attending today's conference and have a nice day. A recording of this conference will be available for 30 days following this call.

[Operator Instructions] At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Ms. Diana Reardon. Ma'am, you may begin.","Diana Reardon","Thank you. My name's Diana Reardon, and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we'd like to welcome everyone to our first quarter earnings call 2014. Q1 results were released this morning. I'll provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question-and-answer session.","The company closed the first quarter with sales of $1.246 billion and EPS of $0.99 before one-time items, exceeding the high end of the company's guidance. Sales were up 15% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies compared to Q1 of 2013. ","From an organic standpoint, excluding those acquisition and translation impacts, sales in Q1 2014 were up 7% over last year. Sequentially, sales were flat in U.S. dollars and down 5% organically from Q4 of 2013. ","Breaking down our sales into the two major components, our cable business which comprised 7% of our sales, was up 4% from last year. Our interconnect business, which comprised 93% of our sales, was up a strong 16% from last year resulting from the dual benefit of good organic growth and the impact of our acquisition program. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. ","Operating income, excluding one-time items, increased $234 million from $207 million last year. Operating margin, excluding one-time items, was in line with our guidance at 18.8%, down about 40 basis points from last year. The decline in operating margin is due primarily to the lower profitability level of the advanced sensor business acquired in December of 2013. ","As discussed on our last call, this acquisition is accretive on an earnings-per-share basis, so it [ph] reduces the company\u2019s overall operating income percentage as the business currently operates at a lower level of profitability than the average of the company. We\u2019re very excited about the potential of the acquisition and expect their operating income margins to improve over time based on the combination of their excellent management team, leading technology and Amphenol\u2019s strong operating discipline. ","From a segment standpoint, in the cable segment margins were 12.2% equal to last quarter and down from 13.8% last year, primarily due to the impact of market pricing and some impact from product mix. In the interconnect segment, margins were 21%, down from 21.4% last year. The year-over-year interconnect operating margin decline reflects the acquisition impact I just discussed. ","We are very pleased with the company\u2019s operating margin achievement and continue to believe that the company\u2019s entrepreneurial operating structure and culture of cost control allows us to react in a fast and flexible manner, thereby constantly adjusting the business to maximize profitability in what continues to be a dynamic environment. ","Through the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry leading operating margins and remained fully committed to driving enhanced performance. ","As we indicated in our January earnings call and as is required under US GAAP, the company has recorded a one-time acquisition related charge of $2 million or $0.01 per share in Q1 of 2014 relating to the amortization of the value associated with acquired [ph] backlog for the Q4 2013 acquisition. ","Our interest expense for the quarter was $19.1 million compared to $15.5 million last year. The increase over last year is due primarily to higher average debt levels resulting from the company's acquisition and stock buyback program. ","Other income was $4.1 million in the quarter, up from $2.8million last year, primarily as a result of higher interest income and higher levels of cash and short term cash investments. The company's effective tax rate, excluding one-time items, was 26.5% in Q1 2014 and approximately 26.8% in Q1 2013. ","On an as reported basis, the company's effective tax rate was 26.4% this quarter compared to 21% in last year\u2019s quarter. As previously disclosed, Q1 2013 tax provision included income tax benefits of approximately $11 million or $0.07 per share resulting from the delay by the US government in the reinstatement of certain federal income tax provisions for the year 2012. Such tax provisions were reinstated in early 2013 and under US GAAP related benefit to the company was reported at that time. ","Net income, excluding onetime items, was approximately 13% of sales in the quarter and earnings per share, excluding one-time items, increased a strong 14% to $0.99, up from $0.87 last year. On an as reported basis, earnings-per-share was $0.98 and $0.94 in the first quarter of 2014 and \u201913 respectively and included the one-time items previously discussed relating to acquisition charges in 2014 and income tax benefits in 2013.","Bookings for the quarter were strong at $1.310 billion resulting in the book to bill ratio of approximately 1.05 to 1 for the quarter. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash and cash flow from operations in the quarter was $203 million or 127% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income.","From working capital perspective, both inventory and accounts receivable declined about 3% from year end and stood at $773 million and $972 million at the March. Accounts payable was $480 million at the end of March down about 13% from year end. ","Cash flow from operations of $203 million along with net proceeds for the January bond offering of $743 million, a reduction in short-term investments of $24 million and proceeds from stock option exercise of $60 million were used primarily to repay outstanding amounts under our revolving credit facility of $658 million to purchase approximately 1.4 million shares of the company's common stock for $121 million to fund $54 million of net capital expenditures and $9 million of payments related to 2013 acquisition.","Cash on hand increased approximately $136 million in the quarter. At the end of March, cash and short-term investments were just under $1.3 billion, the majority of which is held outside the US. At the end of the quarter, the company had 4.3 million shares remaining under its 10 million shares stock repurchase program which expires in January of 2015. ","And as we previously announced in January of this year, the company completed a 750 million, 5 year senior note offering. The notes were issued at 99.846% of their face value and have an interest rate of 2.55%. The company incurred fees of approximately $5.8 million in connection with the sale. ","Debt at the end of March was $2.2 billion and net debt was approximately $924 million. At quarter end, borrowings and availability under the company's $1.5 billion revolving credit facility were $270 million and $1.2 billion respectively. The company\u2019s leverage and interest coverage ratios remain very strong at 1.9 and 17 times respectively and EBITDA in the quarter was approximately $286 million.","From a financial perspective, it was an excellent quarter. Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends. ","R. Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much, Diana and I'd like to offer also my welcome to all of you here on the phone today. As is customary, I'm going to spend some time to highlight our achievements in the first quarter. I will then discuss our trends and the progress across our various served markets and then finally I will make a few comments on our outlook for the second quarter and the full-year of 2014, and we will certainly leave some time at the end for question-and-answers. ","So Diana just detailed, we're very pleased to report that the company exceeded the high-end of our guidance in both sales and EPS and achieved a new record in orders. Revenues in the quarter increased a very strong 15% from prior year and equaled our fourth quarter record sales level of $1.246 billion. ","Orders achieved this new record $1.310 billion which represents a book to bill of 1.05 to 1 and certainly bolsters our confidence for the future. And once again we generated industry-leading operating margins with first quarter return on sales of 18.8%. These results once again make me extremely proud of the Amphenol team. Our agile and entrepreneurial organization continues to react quickly to capitalize on the many dynamic opportunities for growth and strong operating performance that are rising across the ever-changing landscape of electronics industry. ","Before I turn to the specific markets, I just want to say that our management team\u2019s ongoing drive for diversification across the many end markets of the electronic industry has again created significant value for the company in the first quarter. In fact, we are truly proud of this great balance across our various end markets which expose us to every corner of the electronics industry while certainly insulating us from the risk of overexposure to any given market. ","Turning first to the military market, our sales in that market represented 11% of total Amphenol in the quarter. As we had expected, sales were down slightly from prior year and were essentially flat to prior quarter as stronger sales of our products incorporated into military airframe as well as engine were offset by a general moderation of purchasing activities by defense equipment manufacturers. ","While there continue to be many uncertainties in the military spending plans of governments around the world, we are encouraged to see increasing indication of firming demand in this market. In particular, our customers are making continued investments in new electronic functionalities and military equipment and we are capitalizing on opportunities for growth that we see in certain developed geographies. ","We expect demand in the military market to increase from these levels in the second quarter and we continue to expect moderate growth for the full-year of 2014. Importantly, regardless of overall spending pattern, we believe our technology leadership and broad program participation positions us to benefit long-term from the expanding adoption of electronics and military hardware. ","Turning to the commercial aerospace market, this market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased a very strong 26% from prior year and 4% sequentially, as aircraft manufacturers continue to raise their production levels of new airliners on which we have increased content. And as we benefitted as well from the sales contribution from last year\u2019s successful acquisition of Ionix. We remain very encouraged by our expanding presence in what is clearly a fast-growing commercial aerospace market and we are well-positioned to capitalize on the proliferation of electronics content on next-generation planes. In particular, these advanced electronics systems are requiring new higher technology interconnect solution to enhance fuel efficiency and improve passenger experience all of which creates excellent opportunities for Amphenol.","Looking ahead, we expect sales to increase further in the second quarter as production levels for existing and new aircraft continue to climb and remain optimistic for our overall growth prospects in the commercial air market in 2014 and beyond.","The industrial market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. Our sales to this very important market increased a significant 47% from prior year, as a result of contributions from the advanced sensor\u2019s acquisition as well as due to strong performance in the rail mass transit, instrumentation, heavy equipment and medical segments. Organically sales grew a very strong 11%. ","Sequentially our sales increased by 24% primarily related to the addition of advanced sensors in late December. We're very encouraged by our broad-based growth in the industrial market and it is really a clear confirmation of the company's progress in increasing our market penetration while also broadening our technology offering for the industrial market. ","In addition, we are very excited by the future opportunities for cross-selling of sensors and interconnect products used to protect against harsh environment and to ensure high reliability, in particular in heavy equipment, medical and construction applications. ","Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect further growth as we increase our penetration of new sensor and interconnect technologies across a wide array of exciting industrial segments. The automotive market represented 15% of our sales in the quarter. Our sales increased a very strong 47% from prior year and 23% sequentially as we benefited from the diverse range of new automotive products provided by Advanced Sensors and Tecvox. ","We achieved strong 24% year-over-year organic growth driven by accelerating sales of our new products used in infotainment, emissions management and drive train control among another applications. ","We\u2019re very excited to see the result of our expansion into these and other new high-technology automotive applications, as the benefits of our recent acquisitions combined with our long term organic product development efforts to create exciting new platforms of growth. ","Automakers continue to incorporate advanced interconnect and sensor products into their electronic system in new areas of performance management, fuel-efficiency and passenger comfort and infotainment, all of which are creating great opportunities for Amphenol in this important market. ","In fact, over the last five years, these trends have enabled the company to expand the automotive market from 6% of our total sales to 15% in this latest quarter. This is just an excellent example of our \u2013 of the Amphenol organization really reacting to expanding high-value opportunities that can arise with advances and changes in electronics technology. ","We expect sales in the automotive market to increase further in the second quarter as we continue to benefit from our acquisitions as well as from the ongoing expansion of vehicle production and electronic content. The mobile devices market represented 16% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were down slightly from prior year and declined sequentially as we had expected by about 29%. ","As we\u2019ve discussed previously, our sales of products incorporated into tablets moderated in the second half of 2013, as a result of the reduced content opportunity in certain Wi-Fi only and white box tablet devices, a dynamic which continues into 2014. Nevertheless we were encouraged to have experienced growth in the quarter in sales related to new high-performance smartphones and laptops which partially offset the slowdown in tablet sales. ","In the second quarter, we expect some further moderation of demand as our OEM customers prepare for new product releases that are planned really for the second half of 2014. And while we continue to expect sales this year to be down in the mid-single digit range due to the dynamics we\u2019ve already discussed, we do look forward to a step up in sales in the second half of 2014, as we benefit from our strong technology position on a range of new devices. In addition, our highly agile organization remains poised to react to and capitalize upon any incremental growth opportunities that may materialize throughout the year. ","The mobile networks market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter and this is the market where we are very pleased to grow sales by a very strong 19% both from prior year as well as sequentially from prior quarter. In the first quarter we were able to react quickly to a pickup in demand from both base-station manufacturers as well as mobile operators. ","While our year-over-year growth was particularly significant in Asia we actually grew strongly in all regions on a sequential basis. Based on our latest feedback from our mobile network customers we now have a more positive view of this market for 2014. As operators in many geographies have increased their spending on LTE and other next-generation networks, in order to accommodate higher data speeds and to relieve the gaps in coverage and capacity which exists across many wireless systems. ","We are really encouraged now that the pent-up demand that we have talked about for quite some time for investment in mobile infrastructure is really now beginning to materialize. Based on this new outlook we now anticipate further sequential growth in the second quarter and expect our sales growth for the full-year to accelerate from the rate of prior year. In general, we look forward to further long-term strength driven by our broad design and position on a wide array of base station platforms as well as by our growing position with a diverse range of global wireless operators. ","The information technology and data communications market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased in this market 6% from prior year which is really led by growth in our products that are incorporated into servers and storage equipment in particular. Sequentially sales declined as we had expected by 8% due to the normal first quarter seasonality that we see in the IT market. ","As our customers continue to strive for new levels of equipment performance in order to handle what is clearly a dramatic expansion of data traffic I can tell you that our pipeline of new design opportunities with our next-generation products has continued to strengthen. In addition we are accelerating our efforts at working directly with data center operators and IT service providers in addition to our traditional OEM customers. This is actually very important as demand patterns in the IT market are shifting with certain of such end customers increasingly developing tailor-made solutions to their interconnect architecture. ","Looking towards the second quarter, while we expect sales to remain at these first quarter levels in the seasonally lower first half we do remain confident that our technology position will enable Amphenol to continue to perform well into the future. ","The broadband market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were essentially flat to prior year and prior quarter as increased demand by international cable operators was offset by a moderation in cable spending by customers in the US. While the market environment for traditional bulk cable continues to be challenging and competitive pricing environment in particular remains difficult as Diana mentioned, we are encouraged to see the emerging benefits of our product and our customer diversification, both which have enabled us to grow a range of broadband customers while offering a more complete interconnect product offering.","Going into the second quarter, we expect our sales in the broadband market to increase from these levels and look forward to continuing our strong position in the broadband market. ","So in summary, I can just tell you that I am extremely proud of our organization, we continue to execute well in what is no doubt still a challenging and certainly dynamic market environment. Our superior performance once again is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across a very diverse and balanced range of markets, the worldwide presence really Amphenol being in all corners of the world, the lean and flexible cost structure and most importantly an agile and entrepreneurial management team, one that is poised all the time to react to opportunities and to certainly deal with any challenges that may come our way. ","Turning to the outlook, and based on constant exchange rate as well as normal seasonal pattern and in consideration of our strong first quarter performance as well as our current expectations for the remainder of the year, we're not increasing our guidance and expect in the second quarter and full-year 2014 the following results. We expect sales in the range of $1.255 billion to $1.285 billion and 5.110 billion to 5.2 billion respectively. ","For EPS, we expect in the first quarter in the range of $1.03 to $1.06 and for the full-year $4.25 to $4.34 respectively. For the full-year this new guidance now represents sales and EPS growth excluding one-time items of 11% to 13% and 10% to 13% respectively. Our entire team is very encouraged by the strengthening outlook in sales and earnings, especially given the many dynamics in the global economy. ","The ongoing revolution in electronics continues to create for Amphenol tremendous opportunities and I am very confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to continue to capitalize on these opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability and thereby ultimately to drive continued superior performance for Amphenol. ","Thank you very much and operator at this time we\u2019d be very happy to take any questions that there may be.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Our first question Wamsi Mohan, Merrill Lynch, your line is open.","Wamsi Mohan \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch ","Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Adam, on the guidance just wondering if there are any specific reasons for the sub-seasonal guide that's implying below what you guys have done historically? So just wanted to get some color on if you saw some particular trends that you might want to highlight aside from the ones you spoke about?","R. Adam Norwitt","No, look, I think it\u2019s actually very strong guidance Wamsi, I haven't gone back and done a historical analysis of every Q2 compared to Q1, we think that this is actually quite strong guidance. I think that if you look at the beat that we had in the first quarter where we had expected the first quarter to be more things [ph] definitely down, I think this is an outstanding guidance that we have here for the second quarter and for the full year and we feel very good about it. That\u2019s about how I would really say.","Wamsi Mohan \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch ","And Diana, a quick question on CapEx. Why are we seeing CapEx increasing so much versus last year? It was only $30 million last year and now it's $54 million, and $50 million-ish last quarter too. Anything that is changing that is driving the higher CapEx levels?","Diana Reardon","Sure, in the near term here Wamsi, if you recall we had this flood back in 2011 in upstate New York and we are, I think as we had mentioned in the past replacing and resulting that manufacturing facility at a much higher piece of land, I would note, so there is some incremental spending that you see in Q4 of last year, Q1 of this year and then you also see some I think in Q2 as we complete the majority of the construction there. I think that the CapEx last year was about 3.5% of sales, I think it will be about 3.5% this year, so it's really \u2013 it\u2019s kind of still within our historical range but you are right that those two quarters have been somewhat spiky as will Q1 and then I would expect it to kind of go back down to somewhere 3% of sales, or so the spike really relates to the funding of the replacement of that manufacturing facility.","Operator","Next question, : Jim Suva, Citi, your line is open.","Jim Suva \u2013 Citigroup","Thank you and congratulations to you and your team there at Amphenol. I had two questions. The first question is when we think about the integration of the Advanced Sensor business, that's a very attractive market, what is Amphenol doing as far as its efforts to increase the profitability of it? I think you were pretty clear on the prepared remarks it had the ability to be more profitable and contribute a lot more to Amphenol. Is it like raw material procurement, is it sharing of R&D, is it moving to low-cost consolidating plants, are you in similar locations? What are you kind of doing to help out with those margins because it sounds like you have a lot of confidence in visibility that is going to happen. If you can help us to understand that. ","And then the second question is given the changes in the global raw material environment can you help us understand is that impacting your pricing some, is it helping your margins some, how should we think about the changes in raw materials and what your customers are giving feedback to you at Amphenol? Thank you.","Diana Reardon","Jim, I would, just maybe talk about the second question first and then Adam can talk about Advanced Sensors. I think that certainly the environment relative to raw materials is a better environmental than what we had seen in a a while back, I think that as you know very well one individual item by itself isn\u2019t necessarily the answer relative to gross margin trends, it\u2019s really the balance between pricing dynamics in the market and input costs on a combined basis. And what I would say I think that we certainly like this environment better than environment we had a few years back, we really don't necessarily see it as a headwind, I mean as a tailwind from profitability perspective. I would also just point out that if you look at the guidance that we\u2019ve just given in Q2, Q3 and Q4 and you look at the sequential conversion margins that are incorporated and reflected in that guidance, they are quite strong, they are actually above our target of 25% which we have for the company. So I think the guidance that we\u2019ve given on profitability and how that profitability is going to trend, during 2014, off this new base level that we have established in the first quarter is really quite strong and I think it\u2019s fully reflective of all of the opportunities that we do see which would include perhaps in certain specific product areas of the business where there may be some small help from the prices [ph]. ","R. Adam Norwitt","Yeah relative to advance sensors, let me just say generally first that we are extremely happy with the acquisition so far. We have owned it just a few days over four months now. And as we have always said what is our first criteria for an acquisition, it\u2019s people and it\u2019s technology and we feel so good about both of those aspects of this company, now that we get to know them certainly more intimately than one does during the process of an acquisition. So from that standpoint the early return and our early impressions of the business are just fantastic. We have also great feedback from customers, together with the advanced sensors expertise across the sensor element and the new technology. And we still believe with a lot of conviction that that that will be through and we still remain very excited about being part of this new growth platform for the company. ","Relative to the profitability we certainly talked about and Diana mentioned also in her remarks that this is a company that did come in at a somewhat lower level of profitability in which we have a conviction that over time we will get that up to the level of profitability of Amphenol. How does that happen? It starts really with a mindset, it\u2019s not bringing in people and kind of consultants and things like this, it starts really with the mindset of management to take pride in their products and then to execute on those product opportunities and on the production in a way that is lean and able to really make money. I mean ultimately we talked about profit is just selling price minus cost and so we will work really on both sides of selling of pricing for pride of the product and doing that in a cost-effective way. Diana has also mentioned and those of the company, those are all areas that the management team is looking at and it is really that management team, the existing management team in whom we have so much confidence, who is going to drive those things, are they going to be a consolidation with Amphenol, so it\u2019s sort of traditional synergies that maybe companies in many industries could talk about, you know that, that\u2019s really the way that we approach acquisition. We believe that there's tremendous value inside of this company, think that they have a fantastic technology and great people and no doubt about it we\u2019re working intimately with them to find ways to extract even more volume from the business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question Sherri Scribner, Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Diana, I just wanted to ask, and Adam also, about the strength that you are expecting in the second half. If you look at the full-year guidance you took the range up to the higher end of that guidance and you seem to be very confident. I know that you mentioned the mobile devices business is part of the upside you expect in the second but wanted to get more detail and understand if there is some other pieces of the business that you think are going to see some upside in the second half. Thanks.","Diana Reardon","Sure I think from a market standpoint it's really \u2013 in the first case some of those same markets that Adam talked about that we\u2019re strong, being strong for the full year and then being strong for Q1. I think the one other difference that we do expect in the second half which Adam mentioned is we do expect sort of a second half lift to some extent in the mobile device market based on the knowledge that, we have based on our operating in discussions with customers and so forth. There are more new product ramps that are expected in the second half, the Q3 and also Q4 from sequential improvement standpoint in that market does have some impact when you look at the full consolidated results on a first half second half basis.","Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, so it sounds like it is primarily mobile devices and then just general strength overall. Maybe can I also ask about the mobile network piece of the business. You guys finally are a bit more confident that that is improving. Can we get a little bit more detail on what you are seeing there? I know you mentioned LTE and next-generation buildouts, but maybe a little more detail on that would be helpful and if you think that is also part of the second-half recovery. Thanks.","R. Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much. No, we\u2019re actually very pleased with the performance of the mobile networks market this quarter. it\u2019s been, last year we were pleased to finally see growth for the first time in I think the better part of three if not even four years in that market and we grew kind of mid single digits, I think 5% growth last year and we were very pleased to see that growth accelerating here in the first quarter. And as I said at the time of our fourth quarter call that we are cautious always at the outlook in that market because there can be volatility but at the same time we have done a great job over the recent three or four years to position ourselves, very strongly such that if the spending cycle would really kind of let loose to some extent, we would benefit from that, and I think right now what we are seeing in many geographies is that the operators are now finally figuring out how to charge for data and as they figure out how to charge for data, it allows them then to make the investments in the networks that are appropriate to make given this incredible proliferation of high data consumption devices that has been a dynamic that we have all been experiencing for the last half of a decade. So I think that economics of the market starts to work its way out and thereby embolden the service providers ultimately, will have to make investment decisions to make appropriate investment decision.","And we are also very fortunate that in this market we have such a broad presence at the OEM really not leveraged to any OEMs, so whoever wins we are pretty agnostic to that, and at the same time we understand that more and more of the interconnect and the antenna get specified and decided directly by mobile operators on a worldwide basis and so we find ourselves in a very unique position of having those \u2013 that great channel directly to the operators together with the preferred supplier relationships across the board with OEMs wherever they may be. And I think in the quarter we really started to reap the benefits from that position together with \u2013 those favorable economics finally allowing operators to spend money. As I talked about we saw great growth in Asia and certainly the LTE build out in China has not been insignificant benefits but we saw strong really in every geography on a sequential basis, and that was something that traditionally you don't see in this market and of all the signs that make one feel a little more positive about the spending environment that that's one that I would really latch onto, because normally these markets work in kind of countercyclical fashion, there's sort of so much that goes on across the world and Asia builds a lot, North America doesn\u2019t build and vice versa. But in this case we really saw strong performance across the globe and I think of all the things that give me and us \u2013 and our team really the most confidence. ","Operator","Our next question from Shawn Harrison, Longbow Research. ","Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research","Two questions. The first is on the IT datacom business. It sounds from your comments, Adam, that market is slowing a bit and I know you guys have outperformed the market in 2012 and 2013. Maybe you could just comment on where you think growth rates are going over the next 12 to 18 months. And then the second question is just tied to liquidity and cash flow. You guys I think had one of the best operating cash flow quarters for first quarter that I can remember. You've got probably about $1.5 billion of liquidity. Are there bigger deals out there that are becoming available or is it going to be a number of smaller deals, maybe just your bandwidth to handle a lot of incoming deals as well as a management team?","R. Adam Norwitt","Well, look Shawn, relative to the first question IT datacom, I think we feel very good about our performance on a year over year basis in the quarter, we grew 6% in the quarter last year, you may recall we grew that marketplace 7% in a market that arguably was really down last year. And I think when you look at the OEM results and other data points it\u2019s hard to say that that was a market that was up. On a sequential basis the first quarter is usually down and the second quarter usually is also not a strong seasonal quarter in the IT market, you tend to see a little bit more in the second half. I think there are a lot of dynamics in this market and it\u2019s a market where you got to really stay on your toes. When you look at who is really making decisions, where the spending is happening, what's happening to IT budgets, it is a very delicate market in that respect where some of the traditional spending patterns are really being turned on their heads. And that\u2019s why I talked, I made some mention of the fact that if one is really just going to sell through the old channel of OEMs, as one has done for a long long time in the past that can be a very very difficult market.","And I think to our credit we have worked really in a number of different areas in the IT market, so we're not just focused only on the traditional OEMs, we\u2019re working directly with data centers, we\u2019re working directly with service providers where there is some shifting really of the balance of power and the decision-making around the electronics and the configuration of those electronics. What does that mean really for the rest of the year I think if this stage it's a little hard to predict and thus I think our outlook is a very prudent outlook saying that we have this kind of flat performance in the first half followed by a second half that will be up by some amount. Ultimately what that\u2019s going to leave the IT market for the year I think it\u2019s little too early to say, we wouldn't have the conviction about that, because I think we were able to develop around the wireless infrastructure.","Relative to acquisitions and certainly let Diana speak to any liquidity questions specifically but relative to acquisitions and the scale thereof, we have always had an appetite for acquisitions regardless of size, and so as we look out at the universe of companies that one day may become available, we do not apply a criteria which is size of that company, we have made acquisitions that are very small and very productive, new platforms for the company and similarly we have made very significant acquisition like the Advanced Sensors, the one that we made last quarter \u2013 in the fourth quarter which was really the second largest in the history of the company. So to that extent, there are good companies that are available in the industry, that are not available \u2013 but that are out there in the industry that may one day become available really of all different sizes and I don't think that there is really change today in the nature of the size and scope of the acquisition opportunities and our pipeline for acquisition remains very strong, we remain in great dialogue with a number of good companies and as I always say, we remain wholly unable to predict when those will come, which ones will come when. But what I can tell you is when they do as they did with us [indiscernible] fourth quarter we will be poised and ready to take advantage of those opportunities.","Operator","Our next question, Amit Daryanani, your line is open with RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys, and congratulations on a nice quarter. Adam, I was wondering if you would just talk about some of the initial feedback or thoughts you have on the sensor portfolio after having it under the Amphenol umbrella for the last few months now. Are you seeing better cross-selling opportunities at this point and if so where do you think the cross-selling opportunities are more attractive, is that the industrial side or the automotive side?","R. Adam Norwitt","Well I mentioned earlier on \u2013 I mean we have a very positive impression, again we've only on the company, they\u2019ve only been part of our team for four months and a few days here. So it is still early but we're extremely excited but with what we have seen so far and I think in particular we are excited from a technology standpoint. They just have outstanding technology and even more outstanding individuals supporting the development of that technology. So the interaction that happens and has happened really early on have been kind of our engineers to their engineers and I think I stayed there probably for the last time because they are just like our other engineers are. And I think we have seen good opportunities and I would say we have seen them across both of the end markets that you describe, obviously within the industrial market that\u2019s a lot of sub markets, everything from medical to heavy equipment, construction and many many other segments, and as well as in the automotive market, I think one of the premises, one of several premises that we had with this acquisition was that there is a value in the interconnect packaging of the sensor product and there\u2019s just no question about it. We do see that. ","Now what does that generate in the short-term, one can never be too overconfident about changing things from a technology standpoint so quickly with customers but the early returns with those customers, the early dialogue that we are having and I personally have been involved in some of them that they are very very positive. And I'm very confident that long-term that will be a tremendous advantage that we have as we go about slowly over a long time period. You\u2019re building a new platform of growth with this sensor business. ","Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","And I guess, Diana, when I look at the guidance that you guys have now especially with the next three quarters beyond the March 1, it looks like you are looking at convergent margins being sequentially being somewhere in the low to mid 30% range for Q2, Q3, Q4. Could you maybe just talk about what is driving this better conversion margin from the historical trend? I assume GE sensor integration has something to do with it, but maybe if you could talk about the couple of big levers that is driving that that would be helpful.","Diana Reardon","Sure, I think that as you point out and I think as I said in response to another question, you are right, we get a higher conversion margin in those three quarters than our goal. I think that we have, if you go back historically especially in the Q2 kind of a timeframe had a conversion margins that were more in that range. So I think there is a combination of factors certainly, I know the sequential volume increases as we go along here with growth during the year is all factor, I think that the environment in general from a margin standpoint is probably slightly more supportive than it had been in the prior years and \u2013 that balance of pricing and cost. I think when you get into the second half of the year there is some contribution in there from some expected improvement in some of the acquisitions that have come in later in 2013, certainly not up to the average level of the company yet. But as we go through those quarters, there is some improvement that we are expecting. In addition, we have got a market or two in there that had been sort of flat to down for a few years is starting to come back. So I think in general, we\u2019ve got some positive trends in the business from an operating management standpoint, I think we\u2019ve got a high degree of confidence throughout the company in achieving these high levels of conversion margins and we actually feel pretty excited as a team to be able to now incorporate those into our guidance for the remainder of the year and really start to build back as we get into the second half of 2014 to levels, when you compare to the prior year that would be exactly where we would want them to be as a company as a whole.","So those are I think the main factors Amit.","Operator","Next question, Mark Delaney, Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney \u2013 Goldman Sachs ","Thanks very much for taking the question. I was hoping first you could elaborate a little bit more on the outlook in mobile devices. I understand there is some new wins. If you could help us understand what sorts of products those are in, if it's antennas or connector products. And then maybe related to that if you could talk about what the opportunity is in the consumer wearables market?","R. Adam Norwitt","Well, Mark, thank you very much for the question. As I discussed, our outlook at this stage for the mobile device market would certainly be to have in the second half to pick up based largely on on some new programs, a wide number of new programs and as you can imagine I am not going to talk specifically about anything at this stage but let be said these new programs are really broad across the broad range of applications that we participate in and we participate in everything from smartphones to ultrabook to mobile computing devices which include things tablets and E-readers. So I am not going to comment about others specific but really not prudent given interaction with customers and the various confidentialities that there is.","Mark Delaney \u2013 Goldman Sachs ","And then for my follow-up question, I was hoping to talk a little bit more on the Advanced Sensors business and really centers more broadly if you could talk about what you think the potential growth rate of that business is in terms of revenue growth? And then if there are other parts of the sensor market you'd like to expand in be it consumer or other types of the sensor end markets.","R. Adam Norwitt","Look, I think as I have said we believe that this acquisition which is big for Amphenol but really small given the overall size of the broad sensor market, it is very exciting for us. I mean if you look at the broad sensor market what is the real number for it, but we\u2019ve heard numbers in the range of kind of $50 billion in size, roughly the same as the market for connectors and with our $225 million in sales, that puts us in a certainly small, for us significant but a small on a relative basis. So where is the growth going to come from for us, I think there\u2019s going to be a lot of opportunities for growth and is that going to be in what markets. Today we are stronger with the Advanced Sensors business in the industrial and automotive markets, we think there are tremendous opportunities for growth in those markets. One can imagine that we would be very interested in pursuing other markets where high reliability, harsh environment, the packaging of the products would be part of a very compelling sales proposition to customers.","Are we going to end up getting into consumer sensors and other things? I think that would \u2013 that's not something that necessarily would be at the top of our list and it certainly wouldn't be for us a high priority at this stage but I am not going to close any doors long-term. We will see, we're still learning about the sensor market, it is a very exciting market and it\u2019s a market where I think I've mentioned before what excites us so much about it is the makeup of that market just reminds us so much of the connector market, took [ph] 15 or so years ago a market where you have just tremendous diversification, a market where you have you tremendous technology innovation, where you're making a product which ultimately as a small component in a broader more complex system but it\u2019s a component that is very critical whereby if that fails, things don\u2019t work in the overall system and thus you can embed inside that product in outstanding degrees of technology which ultimately allow you to realize strong returns and the kind of returns that we want to make as a company. Ultimately what\u2019s the growth rate going to be of that business, we wouldn\u2019t have bothered if we thought it wasn't going to grow and we have certainly strong targets of our own growth. We are achieving strong growth today and we don\u2019t hold any operation or division in Amphenol to a lower standard than we hold collectively to ourselves. So we would certainly expect and drive that organization to grow at least as fast as we can grow as a company and then long-term we look to grow organically, we look to grow inorganically, through acquisition. And we're going to be very opportunistic and very \u2013 on one side and very methodical on the other side to really get to know the market from our position of strength and expand ourselves. Just again \u2013 just as we have done in the interconnect market for the last decade and a half. And I think\u2026 that\u2019s the real opportunity across Advanced Sensors business long term.","Operator","Our next question, Amitabh Passi, UBS.","Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS ","Adam, I guess first question for you was book-to-bill, 1.05, most of your commentary on most of the end markets is quite constructive going to the second quarter yet you expressed a level of caution in the macro environment. I just wanted to see if you can flesh it out a bit more. Did you see or are you still seeing a lot of volatility order, week to week, in terms of incoming orders? Did things soften as the quarter progressed? Just any incremental insight in terms of why the sort of hesitation and the caution still.","R. Adam Norwitt","Look, I think that we \u2013 first of all, to answer your question about the quarter, the quarter progressed actually very nicely throughout the quarter, there wasn't any incremental weakening, the end of the quarter was strong, the beginning of the quarter was strong and February included the Chinese new year, so you can imagine that you have a little bit of done well [ph] kind of a quarter there. And I think that was not abnormal and there was certainly no change in how we finished the quarter to drive. We feel that this is actually very strong guidance and if you look at the guidance across the course of the year, as we\u2019ve talked about it certainly does strengthen throughout the year. I think when we look at the book to bill which was extremely strong I would tell you that some of the bookings come in what I would term more of our longer cycle businesses, things like industrial and aerospace And military. And those don't always convert immediately within the 90 days following the quarter in which they were booked. ","And so that\u2019s about maybe the only thing I would say to add little more color to the timing of the orders. But I will just tell you we feel that this is actually very strong guidance and a very strong outlook going into the rest of the year.","Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS ","Excellent and then just as a follow-up, Diana for you, with respect to OpEx and interest expense for the second quarter, can you give us maybe just incremental insight in terms of what you are assuming in terms of how OpEx trends and interest expense?","Diana Reardon","Sure, interest expense will be somewhere around 20 million or so a quarter in Q2 and Q3 and then will come down in Q4 when our notes are retired. From a SG&A or OpEx standpoint, the lift that you see in the first is really that acquisition impact that I talked about on the operating income line. So that\u2019s sort of in reset as the kind of full quarter of consolidation for the acquisitions that have somewhat higher SG&A levels as I think Adam mentioned before and I think I mentioned on the last call. As we look into the remaining quarters of the year, we would expect I guess a normal Amphenol pattern as we look to more tightly control those expenses including those of the prior companies and I would expect, as a percentage that SG&A will start to come down, it would grow into slower space than the sales growth from a sequential perspective.","Operator","Our next question, Mike Wood, Macquarie. ","Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie Research ","I saw one wireless carrier offering free 4G LTE data with the Wi-Fi service. Is that a sign that you're seeing the stability in the mix between Wi-Fi only tablets and 4G tablets. Can you comment on what you have seen there?","R. Adam Norwitt","I am not close enough to know what carrier and how that is. But I think that if there is one thing that is happening is that carriers are looking if at all possible to offload this tidal wave of data from their cellular networks which are quite expensive to WiFi networks which certainly have much much lower operating expenses to them and so you will see some of the major carriers in North America who are really trying at all that they can do to bundle that kind of a Wi-Fi hotspot accessibility for free together with their more mobile broadband that really has to run over the over the wireless base station. So other than that I don't know that I would have any further insight to that specific offer that you mentioned.","Again, what I would just reiterate is what we are seeing is that the conviction of the carriers broadly to spend money seems to be strengthening at this time and that then translates ultimately into their willingness to spend capital on a more aggressive schedule which ultimately we can enjoy some of the benefits of and I think part of that willingness is that they are figuring out how to charge. I mean I am a perfect case study or canary in the coal mine if you will on this. I had for so many years this wonderful grandfather unlimited data plan with my carrier who I have been a phenomenal customer for, for so many years. And then I got a device and I didn't actually have the option of mobile broadband and I wanted to tether it and here they said, well, if you want to tether it, you got to give up your unlimited data plan and there I am kind of stuck between the two mills on tier [ph] to make that decision and ultimately I did give up my unlimited data plan. And I think I'm not the only one that\u2019s been going through that kind of a calculus. They are being very, very astute, I think the operators are figuring out how to migrate people off this plan and thereby start to charge for the data at the same time as they are trying very hard to move people into different means of accessing that data. ","And together that is a very favorable result I think for the overall market and one which we are able to [indiscernible]","Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie Research ","Great color on that. Now that Advanced Sensors is part of the portfolio for four months is it too early to tell or are you seeing the deal pipeline grow now that you have this larger served market?","R. Adam Norwitt","I think it\u2019s early, we\u2019re not going to comment specifically about which acquisitions or pipeline in which market. But it\u2019s certainly something that long-term we will keep our eyes open for, no question about it. Our ability to acquire company is really very special advantage of Amphenol, it\u2019s a real organic advantage of the company, in fact that because of our unique organizational structure we\u2019re able to bring companies in, in a very undisruptive fashion and because of our very lean approach to acquisitions we\u2019re able to do this very, very quickly, we\u2019re able to react when the opportunities are there and that ultimately does position us really an acquirer of choice, or the acquirer of choice in the industry. And I think as we expand our platform and start looking outside of the connector towards sensors, from an acquisition standpoint, those same benefits that we bring to bear over the last decade and a half in a very successful acquisition program, we see no reason to think that those same benefits cannot also pay dividends in the potential acquisition of sensor companies.","Operator","Our next question, Steven Fox, Cross Research.","Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research ","Just one question from me regarding the wireless infrastructure market. Adam, you talked about how some of the sales are coming closer to the carrier's decision. Is there a way to break that down in terms of how much of the cable assemblies that you may be doing are related to that decision process? And then what does that do from a lead time standpoint or visibility into your business as a whole in terms of looking at wireless infrastructure? Thanks","R. Adam Norwitt","I'd rather not talk very specifically about how much of our sales to carriers and how much to OEMs. And that\u2019s something we like to keep in our knowledge and not in the pocket of our competition. But what I can tell you is that our growth in the market is actually very balanced between the OEMs and the installation and the carrier business and some of the installation business is working directly with carriers, some of that is working with really the sales teams of the OEMs, and no question about it, the requirements when you work with a service provider as opposed to an OEM, are very different and that's true if you\u2019re talking about wireless, it is true when you talk about broadband, it's true as we see that migration happening in the IT datacom market. Carriers have very, very different requirements and very different priorities than do OEMs. I mean ultimately an OEM has a job which is to run their factories as efficiently as possible and thereby be able to solve \u2013 to be able to support their customers and it\u2019s a somewhat more predictable business that they have, that when you're running factories, they don\u2019t want to have that massive volatility in their factories. ","As opposed to a carrier, oftentimes what the carriers care most about is hey, the crew is ready and able to set it up, are the parts all there on time because if it\u2019s missing one bolt or nut or clamp, the crew can climb up on the tower to put everything back together again. And so there is certainly a premium put on responsiveness and on the agility of \u2013 the lots about the agility of our organization and how we\u2019re able to adapt very quickly to the different requirements of various markets and I think this is a perfect example of that where we have organizations who have been used to that sort of, more sort of steady drumbeat interaction that you would have with an OEM, who have really retooled themselves to interact with an operator and deal with the operator on their own terms, because you can't force them to deal with you on your terms very successfully, you got to adapt, you\u2019ve got to be agile, you got to react to the realities of the market that you're trying to be successful in. And I think that we have done that. So yes, a lead time sometimes shorter, is there a little more volatility in the installation market, you don\u2019t know, they have crew of four people going to a tower and one of them calls in sick, they don\u2019t go that day, they don\u2019t need the parts, or it shows and they don\u2019t need the parts, or there is a storm [ph], they need even more. So, but that is something that we've been doing for a very, very long time in Amphenol, you know that we have had our broadband, or cable business for a very long time, that has always been the service provider business. So many of the things that we know in dealing with service providers through the broadband market, we certainly are able to use methodologies and approaches in dealing in the wireless infrastructure market. And on a more recent basis in the IT market it\u2019s the same dynamics come about. ","Operator","Our next question, James Kisner, Jefferies.","James Kisner \u2013 Jefferies & Company ","Thanks for squeezing me in there. Just regarding the conversion margin discussion and also just the improving materials cost environment, I'm just kind of wondering knowing you guys manage to a bottom line, but might you expect to see some of that improved contribution margin to come from improvement in gross margin? We've got a couple of years here where you have not hit 32%, more closer to 31% now, might we see some improvement in gross margin?","Diana Reardon","Look, I think as you pointed out in your question, we really do manage to the bottom line and it\u2019s been a very successful strategy for us. We have a very diverse business and the components of that bottom-line whether it\u2019s gross margin or SG&A do vary some depending upon the particular type of product, the market, type of technology. And so I think over time we may see some positive conversion on both lines but from our perspective the most important thing is how the conversion looks on the bottom line and I think we will continue to manage the business that way and we do so by specifically to what gross margin or what SG&A are going to do in a particular quarter. I think I said in response to the SG&A question that we would expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to come down some as we move along and sales grow during the year. And we do expect to see very strong conversion margin on the bottom line as we move through 2014 and we\u2019re certainly very excited about that, but exactly where that\u2019s come down at the end of the day we can\u2019t really say at this point and we do believe we get the best performance by making sure that all costs are managed [indiscernible] conduct ourselves and talk about it in that fashion.","James Kisner \u2013 Jefferies & Company ","This is a follow-up. Are there any particular financial hurdles you guys look at in acquisitions, return on investment capital or IRR? If you can't talk numerically perhaps just give us conceptually how you evaluate it if there's any kind of actual financial criteria other than just sort of strategic opportunity for revenue synergy. Anything you can do to help us out there would be great, thanks.","Diana Reardon","I mean we look at a lot of things, I think Adam talked a little bit about acquisitions earlier on the call, I think we look to pay a fair price for a business that has a potential to perform the way that Amphenol does as a total company. And so we look for a business with good management, with technology that has the potential for what we would consider above average growth and above average profitability and we look to make the assessment as to whether or not we think the seeds for that are there when we go through our acquisition review process. We don't have hurdle rate for specific, sort of pinpoint financial metrics because this acquisition is really \u2013 it has its own potential and also has its particular place relative to financial performance criteria, some are better than our average, some are below our average and so each individual decision is really made as it\u2019s expensed [ph] for that particular opportunity.","Operator","Our final question from William Stein, SunTrust.","William Stein \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","Two quick ones. First, if we can get an update on your view on organic growth for the year. I think previously you had a 1% to 4% view. I'm wondering if you are giving any update on that. And then Adam I have a follow-up on the wireless infrastructure business.","Diana Reardon","So the organic growth was about 4 to 6% in the current guidance for the year. ","William Stein \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","And then on the wireless infrastructure side, Adam, you have in the past talked about \u2013 you said a lot about this end market, some of which was different from what some of the other component companies in particular some semiconductor companies have been talking about for a while. One of the things that you highlighted is typically you don't get all regions working at once and now you're starting to see that in addition to this outside strength in China it sounds like. So this kind of begs the question, is this a peaking year and we should expect that in 2015 some of this business rolls off and we go to a more normalized level, or do you see it more as a new base off of which we are going to see still more growth in the future? How can we think about that growth going forward, please?","R. Adam Norwitt","Well, thanks very much for the question. I think it\u2019s really too early to talk here about, is this going to be \u2013 what will be the trends hat going into 2015 and beyond? I think we already feel pretty good that we\u2019re able to give a prognosis, the positive prognosis for what is usually quite a volatile market already for the next three quarters to say that we feel that, that is going to continue to have, a stronger position, a stronger growth rate than we had expected going into the year. So I wouldn't be able \u2013 in any position to be able to tell you what is 2015 going to be. What I can tell you though is this, as I said over the last 3 years we put a lot of effort into this market, even if it was a market that was not growing, architecturally that was not growing from an investment standpoint, we continued across the board to work to expand our position in the wireless market. ","And I think part of the reason why we had such strong performance here in the first quarter and I don't know ultimately is the market growing at what rate, I think there have been maybe one data point earlier today which may have been slightly contrary to our result. But clearly our growth in the market is a very substantial one and I think that is really a realization of some of the benefit of those efforts that we made over the previous years to really again expand our position with OEMs, to broaden our technology, or the range of technologies on to these new forms of wireless base station and to expand the depth and the range of our penetration with wireless operators. And so I think regardless what happens in the market going forward, that position does not go away, it's not like we have a peek in terms of our position in the marketplace. Ultimately what\u2019s going to happen with the spending, only the, few people who are out there who make capital decisions in the wireless market, they are going to be the ones who are going to ultimately have to vote with their wallets here on what the trend is in spending. But our position in this market is extremely strong, stronger I would argue than it has ever been in the past. And with that, that gives us good confidence for this year and certainly I believe that going forward we will continue to have a very excellent position in that marketplace.","William Stein \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","Great, very helpful.

Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session, until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the Company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.","Craig Lampo","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our second quarter 2018 conference call. Our second quarter 2018 results were released this morning, I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends, and then we will take some questions.","As a reminder, we may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information.","The company closed the second quarter with record sales of $1.981 billion and with record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.91 and $0.90, respectively, exceeding the high end of the company's guidance for sales by approximately $86 million and adjusted diluted EPS by $0.05. Sales were up 19% in U.S. dollars and up 17% in local currency as compared to the second quarter of 2017. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisition and currency, sales in the second quarter increased 13%. Sequentially, sales were up 6% in U.S. dollars, and 7% in local currencies and organically.","Breaking down sales into our two segments; our Cable business, which comprised 6% of our sales, was up 4% compared to the second quarter of last year. The Interconnect business, which comprised 94% of our sales, was up 20% in U.S. dollars from last year driven primarily by organic growth. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income was $408 million in the second quarter and operating margin was a record 20.6% in the second quarter of 2018, up 20 basis points compared to the adjusted operating margin in Q2 of 2017 of 20.4%, and up 40 basis points compared to the Q1 of 2018 of 20.2%.","From a segment standpoint, in the Cable segment, margins were 13.2%, which is down compared to the second quarter of 2017 at 14.9%, primarily driven by an increase in certain commodity costs. In the Interconnect segment, margins were a strong 22.4% in the second quarter of 2018, which is up compared to the second quarter of last year at 22.3%. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team which continues to foster a high performance action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a dynamic market environment. Due to careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies to both existing and acquired companies, our management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance in the future.","Interest expense for the quarter was $26 million compared to $23 million last year, reflecting the impact of higher average interest rates as well as the higher average debt levels primarily resulting from the company's stock buyback program. The company's adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 25.5% for the second quarter of 2018, compared to 26.5% in the second quarter of 2017. The adjusted effective tax rate in both periods excludes the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises as we have previously discussed. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2018, including the excess tax benefit associated with the stock option exercises, was approximately 24.7% compared to 20.1% in the second quarter of last year.","Adjusted net income was a strong 14% of sales in the second quarter of 2018. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS grew 14% in the second quarter of 2018 to $0.91 from $0.80 in the second quarter of 2017. Adjusted diluted EPS which excludes the excess tax benefit from stock option exercises in both periods, as well as certain acquisition related costs in the 2017 quarter grew 22% to a record $0.90 in the second quarter of 2018 from $0.74 in the second quarter of last year. Orders for the quarter were a record $2.025 billion, an 18% increase over the second quarter of 2017, resulting in a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.02:1.","The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash; cash flow from operations was $265 million in the second quarter, or approximately 92% of net income which was strong and particular given the higher than normal tax related payments resulting from the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act of approximately $50 million, and including the first installment of the transition tax charge and the [indiscernible] taxes and other taxes paid under repatriation of cash during the quarter.","From a working capital standpoint, inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were approximately $1.2 billion, $1.6 billion and $903 million respectively at the end of June. And inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days, excluding the impact of acquisitions were 78, 73 and 61 days respectively, which were all within our normal range. The cash flow from operations of $265 million along with the borrowings of $179 million under the commercial paper program, stock option proceeds of $30 million, and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $33 million net of translation were used primarily to purchase approximately $263 million of the company's stock, to fund acquisitions of $59 million, to fund dividend payments of $57 million, and to fund net capital expenditures of $78 million.","During the quarter, the company repurchased 3.1 million shares of stock at an average price of approximately $86 under the new $2 billion three year open market stock repurchase plan. At June 30, cash and short-term investments were approximately $1 billion, the majority of which was held outside of the U.S. At June 30, 2018 the company had issued approximately $1 billion under it's U.S. commercial paper program, and the company's cash and availability under our credit facilities totaled approximately $1.9 billion. The total debt at June 30th of 2018 was approximately $3.4 billion and net debt was approximately $2.4 billion. Second quarter 2018 EBITDA was approximately $482 million.","From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter. And I will now turn it over to Adam, who will provide an overview of the business and comment on current trends.","Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much, Craig and like to extend my welcome to all of you on the phone here today. I'm going to spend a few moments just to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter, and then I'll get into a discussion on our progress across our diversified server markets. Then finally I'll make some comments on our outlook for the third quarter and the full year, and of course we'll have some time for questions at the end.","Craig just detailed the company had a very strong second quarter with sales and earnings both exceeding the high-end of our guidance. Revenues in the quarter increased by very strong 19% in U.S. dollars and 13% organically reaching a new record for the company of $1.981 billion. And then for the third quarter in a row we booked another record level of orders of $2.025 billion and that represented another strong book-to-bill of 1.02:1. Operating margin in the quarter reached a new record 20.6% and just yet another demonstration of the strength of the company's operating performance.","Then finally, as Craig said, we delivered record adjusted EPS of $0.90 in the quarter and that grew a strong 22% from prior year. With these results I can just say that I'm very proud of our entire global Amphenol organization, and in a time like this you just see the agility and the superior execution that are clearly reflected in the company's strong results in the second quarter and indeed in the whole first half of 2018.","We're very pleased in the quarter to announce two new and small acquisitions that we completed late in June, All Sensors is a California based provider of high technology pressure sensors for the industrial market with annual sales of approximately $15 million. All Sensors represent another excellent expansion of our already strong and growing sensor offering for a variety of segments within the industrial market including, in particular, medical applications. Ardent Concepts is the New Hampshire based manufacturer of high-speed socket interconnect products for advanced processers, and with sales of approximately $10 million on an annual basis. Ardent enhances our already industry-leading high-speed connector offering, in particular for the communications and the test and measurement markets.","As we welcome these great new teams to Amphenol, we remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create excellent value for the company. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisition opportunities and then successfully bring those companies into the Amphenol family remains a core competitive advantage for the company.","Now turning to our trends and the progress across our various served markets; I just want to comment that as we finish the second quarter we remain very pleased with the breadth and the balance across our end markets. Once again in the second quarter, no market represented more than 21% of our sales in the quarter, and this balance is the true for Amphenol in any economic cycle. And particularly, this quarter we're very pleased that we realized strong organic growth across nearly all of our markets here in the second quarter.","Turning first to the military market; this market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter, had a very good quarter in military. Sales increased from prior year by better than expected and very strong 23% in U.S. dollars and 21% organically as we once again drove growth across virtually every segment of the military market. Our performance in the quarter was led in particular by strength in rotorcraft vehicle, avionics and airframe, communications as well as ordinance related applications. Sequentially our sales came in stronger than we had expected rising 5% from the first quarter. And as we look ahead, we now expect sales in the third quarter to remain at these robust levels and for the full year 2018 we now expect to achieve mid-teens growth in the military market, a very strong outlook.","Our team working in the all-important military market continues to do just an outstanding job of expanding our position in this market. Our success is a reflection of the continued drive to develop leading edge high-technology interconnect solutions which are then incorporated into a broad array of military electronics. And as militaries around the world bolster their spending, in particular, their spending on next-generation solutions our outstanding performance has positioned us to continue to drive strong results into the long-term.","The commercial air market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter and our performance strengthened once again here in the second quarter with sales increasing by 17% in U.S. dollars and 14% organically. Sequentially our sales grew slightly from the first quarter, and as we look into the third quarter, while we expect a normal seasonal moderation in sales -- for the full year 2018 we now expect to achieve a low double-digit increase compared to prior year. We're encouraged by our strong performance in the commercial aviation market in the first half of 2018 and we remain confident in the company's overall position in the global commercial aviation market. We continue to broaden our range of products and support of the revolution of new electronics in next-generation planes, and we look forward to capitalize on these leading technologies for many years to come.","The industrial market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew by a very strong 27% in U.S. dollars and 17% organically. As we again drove organic growth across essentially all segments of the industrial market and this included hybrid bus and truck, railway mass transit, medical, heavy equipment, oil and gas, alternative energy, as well as instrumentation. And in addition, we're pleased to have realized continued benefits from our acquisitions that we've completed over the course of the last year. Sequentially, sales were up strongly rising by 14% from the first quarter. As we look into the third quarter, though we expect sales to moderate from these current levels due to traditional summer seasonality, nevertheless for the full year 2018 we continue to expect mid-teens sales growth in the industrial market.","Our team is just really pleased with the continued strong performance in the industrial market. Whether through our organic product development efforts or our ongoing acquisition program, we've built a very robust and diversified suite of interconnect and sensor products for the widest array of industrial applications. And as electronics continues to transform the industrial market we look forward to realizing the benefits of our excellent position in this important space into the future.","The automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter, and we're going to have strong performance in this market with sales growing 22% in U.S. dollars, 16% in local currency and 10% organically. Sequentially sales growth is expected by 2% in U.S. dollars and 4% in local currency. But looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to remain approximately at these levels despite the summer seasonality and for the full year 2018 we continue to expect sales growth in the high-teens which includes the benefit of acquisitions. We remain excited by the company's outstanding position in the global automotive market, our team around the world continues to expand our range of high technology interconnect products sensors and antennas for a wide array of applications within vehicle. These developments together with our ongoing strategy of acquiring companies that offer complementary technologies has positioned us strongly for the future as car makers continue to integrate advanced electronics into fuel powered, hybrid and electric vehicles.","In addition, our team is accelerating their work with customers on new advanced technologies and that includes in particular, areas such as autonomous semi-autonomous driving. All of this creates an outstanding long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol.","The mobile devices market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter and our sales performance is a bit stronger than we had expected in the second quarter as volumes of certain existing programs were higher than we had thought coming into the quarter. Sales rose by 27% from prior year as higher sales of products incorporated into smartphone and accessories were only partially offset by somewhat lower sales related to tablets and laptops. As we expected coming into the quarter, sales decreased from the first quarter declining by about 15% sequentially. We expect sales in the third quarter to increase significantly from these levels as we begin to ramp up on a variety of new programs. And given our strengthening position on several of these new programs that are currently going to mass production, and of course, as always understanding the mobile devices market is inherently very difficult to predict we now expect sales in the mobile devices market to increase in the mid to high teens for the full year 2018, a very strong performance.","Our results here in the second quarter together with the strengthened outlook continues to demonstrate the extraordinary abilities of our team working in the always dynamic mobile devices market. Their reactivity in meeting the challenging and ever-changing demands from customers all while continuing to focus on development of innovative next-generation products and manufacturing processes has secured our leading position in this important market, and we look forward to continuing to realizing the benefits of this position for many years to come.","The mobile networks market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter and we're pleased that our sales grew strongly in the quarter rising a better than expected 16% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically from the prior year. Our growth this quarter was driven in particular by sales of our high-technology antenna and interconnect products sold direct to service providers; sequentially our sales grew 14% from the first quarter. And as we look towards the third quarter, we expect a reduction in sales from these levels, however, for the full year 2018 we now expect a mid-single digit sales increase from prior year.","As we discussed during last quarter's call, while we're encouraged by our stronger performance as well as our strengthened outlook we did not yet see meaningful changes in the overall outlook for carrier spending; and in particular, we don't believe that spending on 5G systems in 2018 will be all that significant. Regardless our team has continued to work hard to position us extremely well for the future, and so when that next wave of infrastructure spending does materialize we're confident that we'll ultimately participate broadly with our wide array of antenna and interconnect products, both working with global equipment manufacturers as well as the service providers.","The information technology and data communications market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter, and in this market as well our performance was stronger than we had expected coming into the quarter. Our sales grew compared to last year by 13% in U.S. dollar and 9% organically, and that was driven in particular by growth in storage and server applications. Sequentially our sales grew by a very robust 15% from the first quarter with growth in virtually all segments of the IT market. As we look towards the third quarter we expect our sales to remain at these robust levels and for the full year we now expect to realize sales growth in the high single digits which is a fair bit better than we had anticipated coming out of last quarter.","Our position in the IT Datacom market is as strong as ever. As we continue to extend our leadership in developing a wide array of next-generation products in high-speed, power and fiber optics for a broad range of OEMs and web service providers around the world as customers continue to accelerate datacenter performance in order to manage the explosive growth of online traffic. We remain confident that our high technology offering positions us strongly for the future.","Then finally the broadband communications market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter, and sales in this market were down by about 5% from prior years as cable operators continued to moderate their spending. On a sequential basis though sales rose by bit less than expected 11% from the first quarter. For the third quarter we expect a modest increase in sales from these levels, and for the full year 2018 we now expect our sales in the broadband market to be roughly at the same level as prior year. Despite our more muted outlook for the broadband market this year we're still confident in the strength of our position, and we look forward to realizing the benefits of our expanded product offering and support of customers around the world who are delivering data, video and voice to consumers and businesses.","So just in summary, I just can only say that we're extremely pleased with the company's strong second quarter and successful first half of 2018 as the entire Amphenol organization has continued to execute extraordinarily well in expanding our market position while strengthening the company's financial performance. Amphenol's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages; our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across a broad and diverse array of markets, our worldwide presence, a lean and highly flexible cost structure, and extremely effective acquisition program, and an agile entrepreneurial management team.","Turning to our outlook for the third quarter and the full year; while the overall demand environment is strong there are still uncertainties, and in particular related to trade and geopolitics. So assuming no significant changes to the current economic and geopolitical environment and based on constant exchange rates, we now expect in the third quarter and full year 2018 the following results. For the third quarter we anticipate sales in the range of $1.980 billion to do $2.20 billion, as well as adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.91 to $0.93; this represents the sales and adjusted diluted EPS increase versus prior year of 8% to 10% and 10% to 12% respectively.","For the full year 2018 we expect sales in the range of $7.820 billion to $7.9 billion, as well as adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.57 to $3.61. For the full year this new guidance represents now sales and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 12% to 13% and 14% to 16% respectively over 2017. And in particular, this new outlook now represents full year organic sales growth of 8% to 9%, and this is significant increase from our prior organic growth guidance of 4% to 6%, as well as our original organic growth guidance coming into the year of 2% to 4%.","But we're very encouraged by the company's strong second quarter results as well as our strengthened outlook, and I can just tell you that I'm very confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon these great results in the second quarter and the first half by continuing to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position while also delivering strong financial performance in the second half of 2018 and beyond.","And with that operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there may be.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. The question-and-answer period will now begin. Our first question is coming from the line of Mr. Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney","First question on tariffs; so Adam you alluded to it a bit in your thoughts about your outlook. Can you help us better understand how the conversations are going with your customers and any shifts you're thinking about there? And more specifically, for Amphenol given how many sites that Amphenol has in China; can you help us understand how much of your shipments may be from plants in China into the U.S. and is there any reallocation of your manufacturing that you're contemplating doing?","Adam Norwitt","I mean obviously this has been a big news story here. I think we talked about this last quarter also quite extensively, and one thing I'm just so pleased with our team -- like many things that come along over which one has no control, I mean our team around the world looks at this and says it is what it is, we're going to lean into it and really proactively deal with the situation. And I'm just so pleased when we look at our outlook and we look at the very minimal impact that these tariffs so far have on our outlook for the business, and that's just a result of the agility of the Amphenol management team to react in the face of a changing environment.","Now what does that mean in particular? I think you alluded to the fact of conversations and one of those conversations -- you can imagine that we've been extremely communicative with our customers throughout this whole process and we continue to be so. I mean this is a situation where one has to just be extremely transparent and over communicating in order to make sure that you're supporting customers the best way you can while at the same time understanding that sometimes those costs have to be passed through to your partners whether those be distributors or customers, and our first reaction to the tariffs in the first steps that we take upon those tariffs really being even threatened is to look at what we can do to mitigate the impact of those tariffs and thereby not cause harm to our customers. And I think our team around the world has just done a fantastic job of quickly pivoting towards whatever needs to be done and that -- whatever needs to be done can be a whole host of things; I mean you can imagine with the number of products we sell to the number of different customers and the number of different markets from the number of different facilities that there is a long, long list of different tactics and approaches that one takes to mitigate those tariffs and I don't need to go into all of the details of those but just let it be said that the team is doing a fabulous job of mitigating.","And then to the extent that we're not able to mitigate that -- well, certainly then that gets passed on and worked with customers to ensure that we're minimizing whatever has to be passed on but passing on what has to be passed on through pricing, surcharges and other things. And again, there is not a one-size approach that we're taking to this, it's very much tailor-made to the circumstances of the various products and our team is just doing a fabulous job of dealing with that. Now relative to our position in China -- you know, do we import certain things from China that are impacted by tariffs; of course we do like any other company and in our position. But the other thing that I will say is, you know very well our approach to manufacturing regardless of where it is has always been an approach that emphasizes flexibility and localization. And so we are always making sure that the best that we can, we're going to make the products in the region where we sell it and we're going to make those in facilities that are flexible such that if we need to change something we can change that something in a reasonable time period. And so that's true, we have a strong position in China but it doesn't mean that we're locked into anything and we continue to support our customers around the world very well in those local markets.","Look, I will just say this which is we're big believers in free trade and we believe that ultimately free trade is a positive for all industries let alone the electronics industry which is one of the most global industries and we are a reflection of that global electronics industry as a global company as we are, and we're certainly hopeful in lending our voice to the process very aggressively to make sure that these tariffs are not a long lived experiment here but whatever it is it is and we will make sure that we deal with that effectively and we have done so far.","Mark Delaney","Follow-up question on SG&A which -- the nice SG&A -- leverage I think contributed to the record EBIT margin; so I'm just curious how we should think about SG&A as you move through the year and to what extent some of this leverage can be sustained? Thank you.","Craig Lampo","In regards to just SG&A and just overall profitability the companies are -- certainly we're very happy and excited with the results we had in the quarter generating a 20.6% record operating margins in the quarter. As you know, we don't look at operating margin -- we don't look at our profitability specifically from a gross margin or SG&A's perspective, we really measure ourselves -- measure operations on an operating margin perspective, and certainly whatever our operations have to do ultimately to reach those high performance bars that we set for them, they do regardless of what levers they need to pull within their businesses. You can also imagine that every business doesn't have the same structure in regards to SG&A and gross margin and certain of our operations have higher SG&A levels because that's what they need to run their business and certain of having lower SG&A levels depending on the gross margins that they may have within that business.","So I think -- again, we're very happy with the conversion that we had into the second quarter, the SG&A levels that we have is kind of -- actually I would say is a more typical sequential kind of growth in our SG&A if you kind of look at the growth rate versus kind of our sales rate going into the second quarter, so I would say that actually there is not so much I would point out from an unusual aspect with regards to that but we generally view our operating margins ultimately at the end of the day and we're very happy with that performance, and nothing specific to point out in SG&A from that perspective.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani","Craig, could you just walk through the free cash flow dynamics of -- I think the conversion rate has been under 50% for the first half of the year, I think there is some one-time tax payments there. Just some puts and takes there and then as you get into the back half should we expect this conversion to improve back to the high 90% that you traditionally have done?","Craig Lampo","As you know, we've talked about this in the past and certainly our goal is to drive our annual operating cash flow at a level that's higher than our net income and we have achieved this over many years and we do expect to continue to achieve that. And as I did mention in my prepared remarks, the company did make about $50 million in tax related payments during the quarter and this related to the tax reform that -- it was recently occurred, excluding these payments our operating cash flow in the quarter was actually above our targeted income levels -- our net income levels of over 100%, it was well above that actually. So we do I would say expect in the full year to have that typically strong operating cash flow of over our targeted levels and taking into account these non-recurring pension contribution that we had in the first quarter of around $80 million in addition to the higher level of foreign withholding and other taxes we have paid as it relates to the repatriations during the year that are hired I would say in the first half, then we would expect in the future just because of the -- some of the cash that was overseas that now we're bringing back in a more accelerated fashion.","So, I would say we're very pleased actually with ultimately our operating cash flow performance in the first half considering the working capital needed to support these higher growth rates that certainly we're achieving; and -- I would also mention though when it comes kind of -- past the operating cash flow and we talk about free cash flow that we did talk about this a little bit last quarter and we do expect to have -- and we have had a little bit higher level of capital expenditures during the quarter, again as we mentioned, and we do expect to have this at a little bit higher level during the year. But again, within our range we typically talk about the 2% to 4% range of capital spending in this year and certainly in the quarter we're a little bit higher -- kind of at the top end of that range, maybe very slightly above.","So that essentially I think if you look at our free cash flow it's probably one of the areas that had a slight impact. I think that as -- again, we usually don't talk about 2019 and beyond but I wouldn't expect that we would continue to be at that that much of higher level, we continue to kind of be -- maybe the more middle of our normal typical range show though we've been in the past and therefore I would believe that our free cash flow in the future would be typically strong. But I have to say that, this higher level of capital expenditures to support these -- really strong programs that we've won is really -- I think a testament of the strength of the company and the fact that we're able to support that and drive the strong growth that we're seeing.","Amit Daryanani","And then I guess if I could just follow-up the industrial segment; you've -- it had some really good growth for the last several quarters and I think 2018 you talked about mid-teens organic growth. If you step back and think that -- what seems to be driving this; is that an uptick in industrial spend or is it more content games and market share pickup that you guys have? And do you see the sustained growth levels you have had in '19 in longer term or was there something unique in '18 that's driving the mid-teens growth here?","Adam Norwitt","Well, I mean I don't know about 2019 so I'm not going to comment necessarily on 2019 but I can tell you that we're just -- the growth this year as I mentioned in my prepared remarks is very broad based. And so if one tries to sort of say what is going on across the industrial market, I think there is two things. Clearly, there is a good macro environment overall, and I think that good macro environment overall tends to have a positive impact on industrial. But layered on to that is a trend that is not a new trend but it may be somewhat of an accelerating trend, and that is the adoption of electronics into the industrial space. Whether that is in trains, whether that is in factory automation equipment, whether that is in heavy trucks, in new battery technology, in medical areas; you name it across all of those areas where we participate, so broadly, we continue to see customers just adopting new electronics at an increasing pace and increasing rate of change.","And I think the reason is, is -- industrial is usually slow, it is the last to tend to adopt those kind of new things because you're putting complex electronics into very harsh environments; you think about an oil and gas drilling environment, you think about a high speed train, I mean these are not hospitable environment for delicate and advanced electronics but I think that the ability to package those electronics has gotten so much stronger, our ability and capability to enable the packaging of those electronic functions with our high performance products is really part of that whole drive and I think that is across all these markets the real trend that we have seen here. Now, is that trend going to continue in the future? I would be very surprised if it doesn't because you're just solving a lot of problems when you think about what these electronics are doing, whether that is targeted irrigation, whether that's the tracking of trucks and all the electronics that goes along with that, I mean it's very, very high precision functionalities being put on to equipment that is traditionally thought of as pretty heavy to lug around. It's just -- it's creating a lot of value for the end customers.","But as you know, if there is in 2019 a different macro dynamic or anything else industrial is obviously not immune to that but we look forward for the long-term to continuing to participate in this broad adoption of electronics in the industrial market.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America.","Wamsi Mohan","Adam, in mobile devices we clearly see enough history I guess of volatility and -- you significantly increased your outlook here for the year. Can you give us some sense of what change in the last 90 days -- you know, design wins that have firmed up as a market share clarity on allocation or do you actually see a broader market improvement? And can you give us some sense of how that strength layers in across the back half?","Adam Norwitt","Well, we talked about it last quarter when we also saw a bit of a strengthening environment. I would just say that as you get closer to the second half which is when all the action is in the mobile devices market, you start to get a little bit more clarity into all those things that you described whether that is the strength of your design-ins, the shares you've been allocated or the volume that the customers are expecting, and so I would guess -- I guess the best way to put it is all of those we've seen a little bit more of a favorable perspective on and thus has given us the confidence to have a relatively meaningful increase in our outlook here in mobile devices. Now in terms of the overlay in the second half and I guess you're asking about what the cadence would be between Q3 and Q4; I mean we see a significant increase here in the third quarter as I talked about in my guidance, I don't -- what is it ultimately going to be between Q3 and Q4, there is always a little bit of dynamic to that, it remains a very hard market to predict even within a month or two, let alone across 90 days but I think we would see that we'd have a significant increase here in the third quarter and then we see in the fourth quarter still some increase but maybe not quite as significant on a sequential basis as we see from the second quarter, third quarter.","Obviously, second half to first half as usual is going to be very strong -- I wouldn't say that we're going to have necessarily this year quite as magnified of a second half, at least based on our current view of the market as we had last year; you will recall, last year we had the second half that was close to double what it was in the first half, and so I think that -- we wouldn't expect it to be such a magnified growth in the first half. And we saw as I mentioned my prepared remarks a little bit stronger performance even in the second quarter on some of the existing programs that we're working on. And again, that takes away from the percentage growth that you'd see in the second half.","Wamsi Mohan","And then, are you seeing any impact that your customers given shortages of some components like MLCC [ph] capacitors, I mean whoever heard of some of the MS players start to call out revenue misses because they just don't have enough component availability. Is that becoming a more acute problem relative to last quarter?","Adam Norwitt","I mean, look, we had very strong growth here and very strong results even amidst these very widely reported and real problems that people are facing with access to certain components, and we mentioned MLCC, that's obviously the one that's probably the most talked about but there seems to be a demand on a lot of different components that are out there. Has it had a material impact or meaningful impact on our ability or the demand of our customers to -- for our product, nothing meaningful, have there been anecdotes that we've seen, have we had people that have had to chase things because even we use once in a while some of these things in certain advanced products. I mean no question, I guess we probably had more people chasing things than we had a year ago but it has not had any meaningful impact on either our ability to ship or our customer's desire for our products, at least so far. I mean it's a situation that is very broad in the industry but we do see a lot of customers being very sophisticated about how they're dealing with this and I think it's something that hopefully the industry is going to work their way through.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research.","Shawn Harrison","Adam, I'm probably going to date myself but thinking back over the past -- I don't know, almost 15 years of covering you guys, I don't think I've seen as many kind of drop in orders and upside to kind of current quarter, sales trends as we've seen over the past three to four quarters. And I'm wondering maybe what's your perspective on why that's occurring? We know the macro is strong but are some of your competitors having problems with lead times or there are other factors at work where you're consistently seeing upside in current quarter results?","Adam Norwitt","Yes, 15 years is a long time, I'm actually 20 years with the company today Shawn, so we're both dating each other here. Look, I think we've had really strong performance, it's a positive macro environment as we said but I think also the momentum that we've developed with the breadth of our technologies across such a diverse array of market has really put us in a strong position and that strong position ultimately gives us a great shot of winning with those customers who really need our advanced technologies and so I would say that when you look at our performance on any comparative basis I would say that we're probably winning a little bit more than our fair share. And because of that strength of the technology, the reactivity, I mean -- Wamsi just asked about shortages and the ability of customers to deal with that, I mean you can bet that our team with their typical Amphenolian reactivity is out there responding to customers when customers are a little bit more stressed about the availability of things than they have been in the past.","And so if we can quickly step in and say yes, we can get that for you, we can we can ramp up capacity, we can shift things when necessary -- that at least has a positive image to the company whether that means we're taking particularly business from competitors who can't ship; I wouldn't necessarily point to any specifics about that but I just think the overall offering that we have to customers of high technology products available to them at the right quality at the right cost; we're doing a good job, the team overall, and that's allowed us to capitalize on some of this upside.","Shawn Harrison","As a follow-up if I may, just the mobile information business maybe geographically where was the upside this quarter? And then on the 5G dynamic, if we listen to Ericsson from last week, they seemed a little bit more bullish on the 5G market than maybe you are and so wondering if -- where the disconnect may lie?","Adam Norwitt","Geographically I would say that in mobile networks -- I mean we had decent growth broadly but I will say it was probably more of a North America focused growth quarter for us in mobile networks in the second quarter. Look, Ericsson's got to know a lot more than we are. I mean we're the tail being waged by the dog here, but that being said, we have a very broad position and our discussions with customers -- what we see right now -- not that we don't see anything from 5G but I think what I said is we don't see that as being significant or really very meaningful this year, is there a lot of work going on in 5G, no doubt about it, a lot of work and is there a lot of systems that customers are designing to be 5G ready; I think we see that as well.","But ultimately when we think about the magnitude of a next-generation mobile networks infrastructure build and you know that Shawn better than I do; those can be quite meaningful and it gets launched and there is a big build out that happened. And we don't expect to see those kind of big build outs of 5G this year, there is test sites being built, there is networks that are starting to be flushed out, there is discussions around where that's going to happen first and what those functionalities are going to be but ultimately we don't see that as being significant to our results this year. Now all that being said, I have to say, I mean we come into -- we come out of the second quarter with certainly a more positive view of mobile networks this year than as we -- than it was when we entered the year.","And so, I think that we're pleased with the performance, we're very pleased in particular in the second quarter, we grew double digits organically on a year-over-year basis and we're able to somewhat upgrade our outlook for the full year. So I think we feel really good about the position that we have there and we look forward into the long-term to see when the real substance of 5G -- the substance of those investments comes, we're confident we'll be positioned for it.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Steven Fox of Cross Research.","Steve Fox","First of all, Adam, you touched on a few of these points but I was just curious if you could address directly sort of some of the competitive outperformance; your organic growth is about 2X some of your larger competitors right now. So I was curious if there was two or three things you would highlight that maybe are leading to that? And then secondly, with regard to the tariffs we're hearing a lot about sort of prices going up in distribution as an offset to some of these tariffs but I was curious where the limit is on that and whether you have to manage that a little more delicately than maybe we're understanding? Thanks.","Adam Norwitt","I mean look, I'm not going to speak to others in the industry which are all fine companies but I will speak to our organization. I think I mentioned before, I mean we believe one of the core reasons for our performance is really the agility of the organization to react regardless of the environment. I mean you flip it in a bad time what does that mean? It means reacting on the bottom-line, it means reacting to customers when they are really in -- sometimes very difficult times but in a good economy like we have today it can be just as critical to have that reactivity; the reactivity to get the product to the customer, the reactivity to make investments on behalf of the customers in a timely fashion, the reactivity to accelerate new product developments when people are so busy just making what they have in the current generation, I mean there is a lot that goes on there that ultimately our 110 or so general managers around the world this is the job that they are doing day-in and day-out. I mean they wake up in the morning, that's what they do; when they go -- when they leave the office and head home at night that's what they do. I mean it is just exactly that ability to react quickly in real-time to changing needs, that is one of the greatest assets of Amphenol.","And then you couple that with the technology developments of the company, and I think over the last decade or so we've made just great strides in improving on the breadth and depth of our technology offering to customers. And when you look at the acceleration of what I call the electronics revolution in really every area that we work, there is a premium put on having a technology that is truly able to enable our customer systems to perform at these higher levels that ultimately consumers and businesses are demanding. And this is I guess you would say the better mousetrap approach here and I think our team has developed a lot of better mousetraps in terms of getting the right product to customers for the applications that that they need.","Now as it relates to tariffs, I mean -- look, pricing and all of this is a very, very delicate thing and I mentioned earlier, we're not taking just a single omnibus approach to that but no question in the distribution channel -- there is a lot of discussion about that and a lot of transparency that we have with our distributors. What are -- as you say the limits of that? I mean there are some products where the limits are very low and there are other products where the limits are very different, it really depends on the nature of those products, where those products are traditionally procured from, whether those are movable or not, whether there are other mitigation measures that one can take on the tariffs. And ultimately what the market will bear, and I think by doing that not in a monolithic fashion but rather on a really -- almost part number by part number, customer by customer, application by application approach you're able to much more uniquely tailor each effort towards what the market will bear, what the customers can absorb and pass on themselves or what the nature of the product is and what you can do with that product to mitigate those tariffs.","And I think that is a little bit the same as the answer to the first part of your question which is that ability to be uniquely flexible in each instance is something that helps us a lot in dealing with difficult thing. I mean these tariffs are difficult thing, I will tell you it's not without time spent, I mean our team has spent an enormous amount of time here and I would get up on a soapbox for a minute and say that -- talk about regulatory burden, I mean these tariffs are an enormous regulatory burden on business in general because of the time you spend to manage through them to make sure that your customers are not unduly punished by those measures. But I think our team is doing a really fabulous job in that light.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner","Adam, I was hoping to get your thoughts from the perspective of the market being as strong as it is, we're clearly in a positive economic cycle and you guys guided five of your eight segments to be stronger for the year. I guess trying to parse that out is that upside coming from the strength that you're seeing in those markets in particular or do you feel that that upside is coming from Amphenol's ability to take some share, do a bit better in those markets?","Adam Norwitt","Look, I think it depends is the answer and that's sort of the answer to many things that we always say at Amphenol, it really does depend. I think in some of those markets I would say that we are clearly outperforming even the strength, I mean you just take a look at something like the military market; I mean the military market -- we are expecting now kind of a mid-teens organic growth for the year, and that's just really really strong, I don't think that military budgets are increasing by that month but what I do think is that the adoption of electronics in the military market and our participation in that adoption of electronics is very strong. And so I guess you could say that yes you have a hospitable market but you also have been in the case of the military market at least, very strong performance specific to Amphenol. I mean I don't want to go through all five of those markets as you referred to but just let it be said that I think there is a combination across each of them of -- some macro strength in them, some that is more unique to us.","Sherri Scribner","And then I guess digging into the mobile devices market; I know we've heard from a number of suppliers that they're seeing some benefits in that market from higher ASPs and more complex products. Do you think that some of the strength that you're seeing in the back half is being driven by that or is it more share gains or is it more unit growth?","Adam Norwitt","Well, I think it's a combination of all of them. I mean there is no doubt about it as mobile devices advance and through their generations -- I mean one of two things can happen, either they can get really commoditized and it becomes just a host for some software or it becomes a more premium on the performance of the hardware, and I think we've said for many, many, many years that for us we're going to participate where there is a premium on the hardware and the corollary to that is we believe that ultimately to be successful our customers are going to have to design innovations into their products themselves, not just becoming kind of commoditized hosts for certain software. And I think we've seen that, I think we've seen in next-generation mobile devices more functionality in the hardware and trying to push all of that into smaller packages with higher performance, more signals that are going through them, higher bandwidth of singles; all of that can ultimately drive to more complexity and more technologies that can be embedded within the products.","And to the extent that that happens, I think we've been consistent in saying again for many years that to the extent that that trend continues, we see the mobile device market as a good place to be and I think we're seeing that this year.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Deepa Raghavan of Wells Fargo Securities.","Deepa Raghavan","Looks like the organic growth expectations within automotive continues to be high single digit. Is that correct? And just curious, you did low double digits in first half and as you look into your backlog within auto, is there any moderation expected in second half especially with Europe WOTP headwinds?","Adam Norwitt","I think -- I mean what we've talked about is our overall outlook for the automotive market in the mid-teens. I think we didn't specifically say what our organic growth would be for the year but I think we don't expect it to be much different than it's been here in the second quarter; so we grew in the quarter by 10% organically, so very strong -- I guess 10% would qualify as low double digits, the lowest of double digits let me say. As we look into the second half for automotive, I don't know that we necessarily see much of a slowdown in the second half; I mean -- the only thing is that we had an acquisition at the end of last year in the fourth quarter, so the acquisition benefit maybe towards the very end of the year will be a little bit less but from an organic basis I would guess our automotive business be pretty consistent across the year.","Deepa Raghavan","Share buybacks, that's been pretty strong in the first half, looks like you've taken the benefit of downdraft here but you had to borrow to do that obviously. So the question is, where are you with regards to cash repatriation? And as you continue to repatriate that should we expect the repatriated cash to juice share buybacks or will that be used to pay down debt mostly from here? Thank you.","Craig Lampo","Yes, I think in regards to the share buyback certainly there is a number of factors that we take into consideration; one being certainly the market price of the stock and then as well as other cash needs and the particular period that we're looking at that. And certainly we may purchase more or less shares in particular quarterly period, we have seen a little bit more share buybacks in the first half. As you mentioned we did do quite a significant amount of repatriation in the first half which has actually driven more of the buybacks that we've done, and addition to the fact that with the tax reform just becoming effective in the first quarter is when we really started to repatriate a majority of the cash.","In regards to the buybacks, I wouldn't necessarily signal any significant change other than I wouldn't necessarily also expect the same level in the second half as we do it in the first half; it really depends again based on all the factors that I mentioned. In regards to repatriation, I would say that the first half will probably be higher than the second half by quite a bit. In regards to our repatriation activities, certainly we brought back a lot in the first half and the second half will be much less than that but what we will continue to repatriate where it makes sense from a foreign tax perspective and other considerations.","And then going forward we'll -- from a repurchase activity we'll see what makes sense based on again the cash needs from an M&A perspective or from where we think the market price seems to be. So certainly it's something that we really don't make the decision on [indiscernible] advance, it's really more kind of on a quarter by quarter basis.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of William Stein of SunTrust.","William Stein","We've spoken a lot about tariffs and understanding the very dynamic nature of the company, we expect you've managed that as well as or probably better than anyone else. There is another sort of creeping trend that I'm hearing from industry contacts and I wondered if you could comment on it that relates to inflating commodity costs in particular resins, and I think you mentioned this briefly in the prepared remarks, but if you could give us any more details to your expectations for that trend to continue and you're -- in particular your ability to pass that on through the channel. My understanding is the channel taking those price increases but any comments -- sort of clarifications would be really helpful. Thank you.","Adam Norwitt","Sure. I mean I think what Craig talked about in his prepared remarks was really specific to our cable segment and we have continued to see on a year-over-year basis at least commodity costs have a more magnified impact on that business where materials is the bigger percent of the overall cost basis. I think that it's a little bit of a mixed bag, I mean this year has been very inflationary in it's totality, and I think on a year-over-year basis it's inflationary. Even if some of the commodities, in particular some of the precious metals have pulled back a little bit from their highs over the course of the last maybe -- 60, 90 days, maybe that balances a bit out with some of the dynamics that you talked about with respect to the plastics.","I think look this is something that we just deal with all the time, and so whenever you get commodity price increases at least in our interconnect segment our team is doing everything that they can to mitigate that and to the extent they can't mitigate it then we work with customers to see whether there is reasonable ways to pass the impact of that on to our customers, and you can do that with varying degrees of success based on usually the market dynamics that those customers are facing. And so to the extent that plastics are a little bit up and to the extent that that's maybe balanced a little bit with metals, I mean we don't see right now a real significant impact any different than we have seen that quarter ago or two quarters ago.","On a year-over-year basis it is a little bit inflationary environment but I think our -- I think that inflationary environment is also balanced to the end demand, you know that well Will because you've followed the company for a quite a while. What really matters to us is not necessarily whether commodities go up or commodities go down but do they go up and go down in balance with end demand. And I think we are in a relatively healthy demand environment so to the extent that there are commodity increases that allows our customers, that allows us to pass on ultimately the impact of those commodity increases, it's when there is a disconnect between them and we all saw that -- it was around seven years ago in 2011 where the demand environment was not very robust yet you had a very frothy commodities environment, primarily driven by financial speculation that ultimately created real pressure on margins in 2011.","But if you look at our performance today, we're expanding margins on a year-over-year basis, we're really reaching the highest levels of profitability in our history and that comes amidst what is still a modestly inflationary environment but with a robust demand environment. So I think that if that's matching and the consistency between the two that really matters to us and right now we see that is pretty well aligned.","William Stein","You had very good conversion on the operating line this quarter as you often do, I think it was over 25%. I think you're running above your long-term op margin target, you're doing another acquisition in the sensor category which we think is -- tends to be a long-term accretive to that. Should we anticipate a continued expansion on the operating margin line as we go forward?","Adam Norwitt","Yes, we certainly -- again, we had a great quarter from a profitability perspective, we did deliver a little bit above of what our kind of long-term target is; I mean not significantly above but certainly a little bit above that. And if you look, we don't guide to specific margin numbers but if you kind of -- our implied guidance would if you actually -- looked at the numbers it would actually be pretty -- some margin expansion in the second half, so we do expect to have some more margin expansion. But again on a normal conversion basis, not anything step function or anything like that; so I think that there's nothing I guess unusual that I would point out from that, I think our longer term 25% conversion is still something that we think we can achieve, we're very happy with the results so far this year, we do see a little bit of pressure on the overall year related to some new acquisitions that aren't quite at the level of the average of the company ad in terms of adopting the Amphenol philosophy but we certainly are still committed to having them achieve them and certainly optimistic there in addition to some pressure as we mentioned before on the cable segment in regards to their margins in terms of commodity cost impact. But other than that we're really converting very well and sequentially, I think we'll continue to see that nice conversion towards the rest of the year here.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Jim Suva of Citi.","Jim Suva","One quick question for each of you and I'll ask them at the same time so you can take them in whatever order you prefer but a strategy question more for Adam; Adam you've made now several acquisitions in the sensor area or segment of the world starting with GE sensor and then subsequent to those others. Do you see the world of sensors and connectors merging overtime? Is that like a natural evolution? Do you read them as separate? And then Craig on the integration of the recent acquisitions; can you help us out or they kind of at operating profitability that you're pleased at? Does Amphenol bring in a lot of tools or best-in-class situation or how should we think about the folding in of those from a financial perspective?","Adam Norwitt","Maybe I'll take your strategy question first here. I mean you're correct in saying that we've now acquired quite a number of sensor and sensor-related businesses since the time we made our first sensor acquisition which is now more than four and a half years ago when we first acquired the advanced sensor business from GE. And I just tell you that we were just so pleased with the progress that we've made both organically, as well as through those ongoing acquisitions in that the most recent which is this small company All Sensors that we acquired this quarter.","To your question is the sensor and the connector world just going to merge together? I mean that I don't know. Are we seeing within our company a great value of having that total offering of interconnect together with sensors, I mean we certainly are. I think the presence that we have across a diverse array of markets into really every nook and cranny of the electronics industry that's just a fabulous advantage for the sensor companies. Our ability to work with customers to package those sensor solutions and ultimately which need an interconnect. Sometimes quite significant interconnect content within them that has proven to be a great offering to customers and we've seen quite a lot of progress there with customers who really like the idea of having one product to choke with that consolidated offering.","And I think that the technology trends of the two types of product sensors and connectors; I mean they are really one and the same, I mean you take something like the Internet of Things where you have this just extraordinary explosion of connected devices and what ties those devices so many times together is the fact that they've got to have in addition to some integrated circuit which we're not going to be participating in of course, they got to have a sensor, a connector, and an antenna and when we think of the total range of interconnect products we include in that sensors, connectors, antennas and that creates a great proposition for customers who are dealing with unique and challenging design issues that we can many times help them to resolve.","So I think our strategy is certainly that that is a great offering, whether the industry and whether every company who is in sensors is going to be in connectors and vice versa, I think that I wouldn't go so far as to say. I mean there is plenty of room in the industry for companies who are just going to be in connectors and plenty of room in the industry for companies who are just going to be specialized in sensors and that's -- there are many who will be very successful doing so but I think for our company this has so far been a really good strategy.","Craig Lampo","In regards to the profitability of the acquisitions that these two great companies are at -- you know relatively small, $25 million in aggregate from an annual revenue perspective -- they are not so much different from the company average well below the company average but they're not going to have much of a drag on the overall profitability, just to either size. So in terms of that I wouldn't have pointed out that as something that would have any impact really on the profitability going forward. We do a lot of things as it relates to other acquisitions and sometimes they come in our profitability level, sometimes they are above, sometimes they are below, and there is a lot of levers that ultimately we push, but ultimately it's the operations and acquisitions jobs ultimately to do all that. We talked about it before, we don't think about acquiring companies and having synergies or any things of that nature but we really look at -- we work with the general managers and our groups work with them and they find kind of the places that they think that makes sense for that operation. And then the general managers of those operations are responsible for executing and historically, that's been a great strategy for us and certainly don't see that changing in the future.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Joe Giordano of Cowen.","Joseph Giordano","Just quick question on IT Datacom; what specifically is driving the shift in outlook there? And kind of the bigger picture; of some of the big recession what can trip up the trends in that -- in my data transmission, it seems like one of the most powerful things I can kind of think of. So what should we be on the lookout for and if it's like to -- that can potentially change the underlying structure there?","Adam Norwitt","I think our positive view of IT Datacom comes number one because we had a really strong quarter here and it comes from the outlooks that we're hearing from our customers. We've been talking for a long time about the growing strength of the company's position in the IT Datacom market and that strength which we've developed organically as well as through the number of acquisitions and most notably, the acquisition of FCI that that we made now 2.5 years ago. And I think the strength comes from a few areas; I mean clearly high-speed products where we have the industry's leading solutions for helping our customers manage through this flood of data traffic that they are trying to deal with.","I mean the data traffic is just unbelievable, and when you look at some of the drivers of that whether that's online video which is the most traditional driver of data traffic, I mean which just continues to explode, online gaming which continues to explode, and then these new applications and I mentioned in my prepared remarks when we talked about the automotive market -- while it's still a very small and nascent segment of the automotive market this whole thought of autonomous driving and what that entails from a data perspective -- it really just makes your head spin when you think about the amount of data that's being created to support it, an autonomous car, and the amount of data that a single car is creating over the course of a day, a week, and a year; I mean you're talking in terms of not gigabytes or megabytes but terabytes and petabytes of data that these vehicles are creating in order to map the environment that they're in, and we're obviously at the very, very earliest stages of that kind of a revolution in the automotive industry which then has that knock-on effect of how you're going to process all that data.","And so I think that ultimately that trend of the expansion of data is something that we're capitalizing on the near-term and in the long-term. Now, look -- I mean what can trip it up? I mean, look -- I don't know, there is a lot of things that can trip things up, I mean you imagine a big recession -- there have been lots of dislocations in the IT Datacom market and I think you will recall that there were a number of years where actually the overall IT market was not very robust, we did pretty well during that time period because we quickly pivoted towards some of the service provider opportunities, the web service providers, and we were able to really transform our approach to customers in order to capitalize on where the spending still was but it's a very dynamic market, you have lots of innovation, lots of startup companies, lots of new technologies that are coming out there and there is no doubt about it, I mean there is change always underfoot in the IT Datacom market and so what could trip up the market who knows I think is the answer. But for us what's important is that we've got to remain nimble enough that regardless of what dislocations come along we'll still be able to get our leading products to the right customers who need those products. And I think if we can keep doing that we'll be in decent shape.","Joseph Giordano","On the auto side in terms of your growth, can you flush out regionally how that played out in terms of your forward guidance, any kind of like second derivative changes in one versus the other, regionally?","Adam Norwitt","We had actually in the second quarter really strong performance on a broad basis, actually -- I think organically it was virtually the same across each of the regions, Europe, Asia and North America. I mean I think when I look at our automotive business, the snapshot of it here in the second quarter -- I mean, we have really transformed the original footprint of that market today where we used to be a business that was going to more than two-thirds, if not three quarters in Europe, and then the rest in North American and little bit in Asia. And now when I look at it, I mean Europe is more than a third but less than half, and Asia is around a third, and North America is just a bit less than the third set. It's like the balance that we have achieved across our automotive market is actually really satisfying for the whole team that's working in that space.","In terms of the guidance, I mean we don't necessarily guide on a regional basis, and I wouldn't even be able to tell you what what's imbedded in our outlook from a regional basis but I don't think we see any big dislocations or big differences on the regions as we look into the second half.","Operator","Our last question is coming from the line of Sara Lindon [ph] on behalf of Mr.Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley.","Unidentified Analyst","Just looking at the auto gross [ph] you're experiencing and forecasting, kind of moving forward more broadly could you dive into a little bit what you're seeing in terms of content first production gains from your customers? And then on the content front, like what part of the vehicle are you seeing those content increases?","Adam Norwitt","I think that our growth is clearly outperforming overall the automotive production numbers and you will know better than I do what those numbers are, they are very widely reported. And I think we continue to see content, what the number is, I wouldn't really be able to tell you exactly what percent of our overall organic growth in the quarter; I mean we grew 10% organically in the quarter, I would guess the majority of that is either share gain or content because the production is not growing anywhere near that rate. And in terms of the applications, there is a lot to list share and I don't want to keep everybody on the phone all afternoon, but just more broadly, we are seeing -- as I talked about in the industrial market, the adoption of new electronics everywhere in the car, everywhere from new navigation and telematics systems, to safety systems, to more efficient mechanisms for transmissions and engine management, braking systems, hybrid electric drive trend [ph] systems, and even the early beginnings of autonomous or semi-autonomous driving systems.","So there is a lot of different applications in the car; I mean you look at a car today and I had the good fortune to ride in a few of these really advanced cars more recently, and -- I mean these are just data centers with wheels on them. And it's our job to make sure that we design our products into every part of that data center on wheels to allow us to participate as these new revolutions continue.","Unidentified Analyst","And then quickly need to touching on IT and Datacom; can you expect to continue to see your legacy enterprise business like driving the business forward or would growth be primarily driven in the hyperscale sort of thing?","Adam Norwitt","Look, I guess if you look over the last few years, we've seen more growth coming out of the hyper sale or the web service area but we continue to see a lot of efforts and a lot of new technology developments with our -- I wouldn't call them legacy but there are traditional OEM customers who are still designing really advanced equipment and marketing that on a very broad basis. So I think we see still good opportunities in both, I guess that shift that we've been taking advantage of towards web service providers is something that is not changing today, so I suppose if one were to look forward you wouldn't see that that shift is going to go away; so I guess by definition we'd see a little bit more -- continued more strength coming out of the web service provider.","But look at the end of the day, I mean we don't really care. I mean for us just what's important is that customers regardless of whether they are OEMs, web service providers or enterprises directly that they are continuing to strive for these new equipment functionalities that can help them deal with data transfer rates expanding as we discussed earlier. And so it's the same job that we have regardless to develop those leading products to make sure that we're doing our part to help the industry in it's totality, capitalize upon, and manage through this really explosion in data traffic.","Well, thank you thank you very much. Operator?","Operator","We have no longer questions in queue, you may proceed.","Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much. And again, we appreciate everybody's time today. I wish that everybody has a good continuation of your summer, and we look forward to speaking to everybody in the fall. Thanks again.","Craig Lampo","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for attending today's conference.

Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce today\u2019s conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.","Craig Lampo","Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol\u2019s CFO. And I\u2019m here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2019 conference call. Our first quarter of 2019 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and then Adam will give you an overview of the business as well as current trends, and then we will take questions.","As a reminder, we may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the first quarter with sales of $1,959,000,000 and with GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.87 and $0.89, respectively.","Sales were up 5% in U.S. dollars and up 8% in local currency as compared to the first quarter of 2018. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the first quarter increased 5%. Sequentially, sales were down 12% in U.S. dollars and in local currency and 14% organically. The sales decline was driven primarily by the anticipated reduction in the mobile devices market.","Breaking down sales into our two segments. Our cable business, which comprise 5% of our sales, was down 1% in U.S. dollars and up 2% in local currency compared to the first quarter of last year. The interconnect business, which comprise 95% of our sales, was up 5% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency compared to last year. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.","Adjusted operating income was $393 million for the first quarter of 2019. Adjusted operating margin was 20.1%, which is down 10 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2018, reflecting the impact of SSI\u2019s slightly lower than company average profitability. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, adjusted operating margins are down 90 basis points, which is primarily driven by normal conversion on the reduced sales levels.","From a segment standpoint, in the cable segment, margins were 10.9%, which was down compared to 11.7% in the first quarter of 2017, primarily driven by product mix. In the interconnect segment, margins were a strong 22% in the first quarter of 2019, which was down slightly compared to the 22.1% in the first quarter of last year.","This strong performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the Company\u2019s entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture, which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and, thereby, maximize both growth and profitability in a dynamic market environment.","Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies to both existing and acquired companies, our management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance in the future. Interest expense for the quarter was approximately $30 million, which compares to $25 million last year.","As discussed in our prior earnings call, this increase is due to higher average interest rates as a result of the recent bond issuance and the generally higher interest rate environment in addition to higher average debt levels. The company\u2019s adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2019 was approximately 24.5%, which we expect to maintain this year. This compared to 25.5% in the first quarter of 2018, compares to our prior expectation and guidance of 25%. The adjusted effective tax rate excludes the impact of the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises and the tax effect of acquisition-related costs incurred in both periods.","The company\u2019s GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2019, including the items just mentioned, was approximately 22.8% compared to 24.4% in the first quarter of 2018. Adjusted net income was a strong 14% of sales in the first quarter of 2019. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS grew 4% in the first quarter of the year to $0.87 compared to $0.84 in the first quarter of 2018.","Adjusted diluted EPS grew 7% to $0.89 in the first quarter of 2019 from $0.83 in the first quarter of 2018. Orders for the quarter were $2,003,000,000, which was down 1% compared to the first quarter of 2018, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02:1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash.","Cash flow from operations was $344 million in the quarter or approximately 125% of adjusted net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were approximately $1.2 billion, $1.7 billion and $797 million, respectively, at the end of March. And inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 84, 78 and 55 respectively all within our normal range.","The cash flow from operations of $344 million, along with proceeds from the bond offering of $500 million, borrowings of $268 million from our commercial paper program, proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $47 million and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand of approximately $306 million net of translation were used primarily to repay the $750 million, 5-year senior note, to fund acquisitions of approximately $399 million, to repurchase approximately $160 million of the Company\u2019s stock, to fund net capital expenditures of $70 million and to fund dividend payments of $69 million.","During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.8 million shares of stock at an average price of approximately $90 under the $2 billion, three-year open market stock repurchase plan. At March 31, cash and short-term investments were approximately $1 billion, the majority of which is held outside of the U.S. At the end of the quarter, the company had issued approximately $889 million under its U.S. and euro commercial paper programs. And the Company\u2019s cash and availability under our credit facilities totaled approximately $2.6 billion.","Total debt at March 31 was approximately $3.6 billion, and net debt was approximately $2.6 billion. In addition, we have adopted the new lease accounting standard, which was effective during the first quarter of 2019. I would note that the new standard had no impact on the income statement or cash flow, and the balance sheet reflects a gross up of approximately $180 million for the right to use asset and the offsetting lease liabilities recorded related to the Company\u2019s outstanding leases. The first quarter 10-Q will include the relevant required disclosure related to this new standard.","The first quarter of 2019 adjusted EBITDA was approximately $479 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter. Before I turn the call over to Adam, I would like to make a brief comment relative to 2019 guidance. Our current guidance reflects a reduction in our expectations for the mobile devices market, resulting in anticipated full year decline of approximately 30% for this market. This compares to our prior expectation of mid to high teens decline. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a moment.","I will now turn it over to Adam, who will provide an overview of the business and comment on current trends.","Adam Norwitt","Well, Craig, thank you very much, and thanks to everybody for joining our conference call here on a wonderful spring day in Wallingford, Connecticut. As usual, I\u2019m going to highlight our achievements in the quarter and then spend a little bit of time discussing the trends and progress across our diversified served markets. And then I\u2019ll spend a few moments to comment on our outlook for the second quarter and the full year, and then, of course, we\u2019ll have time at the end for questions.","With respect to the first quarter, our results in the quarter were stronger than we had expected coming into the quarter. We exceeded the high end of our guidance in both sales and adjusted earnings per share. Sales in the quarter grew 5% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency, reaching $1,959,000,000 billion and very pleased that sales in the quarter grew organically by 5%.","The company also booked just over $2 billion in orders, representing a book-to-bill of 1.02:1. And our adjusted operating margins were again very strong in the quarter, reaching 20.1%. Finally, the company generated strong operating cash flow of $344 million in the first quarter as Craig described, which is yet another strong reflection of the quality of Amphenol\u2019s earnings.","Just have to say with respect to our overall results in the quarter that I\u2019m extremely proud of our team around the world. The results this quarter once again reflect the true value of the discipline and agility of Amphenol\u2019s entrepreneurial organization, as we continue to perform well amidst the very dynamic electronics industry, all while driving outstanding operating performance for the company.","Very pleased in the quarter to have completed two new acquisitions, actually just in the last several weeks, which collectively represent $140 million of annualized sales and which we acquired for a total purchase price for approximately $200 million. Aorora, which we completed three weeks ago is a provider of high technology, fine pitch printed circuit board connectors based in Huizhou, China. Aorora has annual sales of approximately $20 million. Aorora\u2019s products are sold into the automotive and IT datacom markets and are incorporated in particular into embedded computing platforms in these areas.","The company represents a great complement to our already broad array of connector products for these important markets. Charles Industries, which closed actually just yesterday is a manufacturer of harsh environment, fiber optic and copper interconnect enclosures, sold to service providers in the mobile networks and IT datacom markets. Charles is based in Schaumburg, Illinois, and has manufacturing operations around the U.S. and Florida, Illinois and Missouri and the company expects annual sales of approximately $120 million.","I can just say that as we welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, we remain very confident that the Company\u2019s acquisition program will continue to create great value. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisition opportunities and then to successfully bring these new companies into the Amphenol family remains a core competitive advantage for Amphenol.","Now turning to our progress across our served markets, just to reiterate once again, how pleased we are that the company is balanced and broad end market diversification continues to create value for the company. In particular, no market in the first quarter represented more than 21% of our sales. We believe this diversification helps to mitigate the impact of the volatility of individual end markets, while also continuing to expose us to the leading technologies around the interconnect industry, wherever they may arise.","Turning first to the military market, the military market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by a better than expected 16% in U.S. dollars and 18% organically. This growth was very broad based, but it was driven in particular by growth in military vehicles, avionics applications as well as space. Sequentially, our sales increased by 4% from the already very strong fourth quarter.","Looking ahead, we expect sales in the second quarter to again increase from these first quarter levels and for the full year 2019, we now expect to achieve mid-teens sales growth in the military market, a stronger performance than we had anticipated coming into the new year. I just have to say how proud I am of our entire team who works in the military market. They continue to leverage our broad and high technology products range, across a wide array of next generation military applications.","This position together with the current robust military spending environment has resulted in us expanding our overall position in the military interconnect market. Our upgraded outlook for 2019 is another reflection of this strengthening and we look forward to continuing to enable next generation military electronics for many years into the future.","The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter and in this market as well, our sales in the quarter were stronger than expected, growing 14% in U.S. dollars and 16% organically, as we continue to grow our design-in position amidst increasing volumes from commercial aircraft manufacturers. Sequentially, our sales increased by 6% from the fourth quarter.","Looking into the second quarter, we expect sales to moderate somewhat from these levels but, nevertheless, for the full year, we have now raised our expectations to mid- to high single digits sales increase as procurement of our products used in commercial jetliners continues to expand. We remain encouraged by the company\u2019s strong technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems integrated into such airplanes. And we look forward to benefiting from that position for many years to come.","The industrial market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter, and sales in industrial increased by 10% in U.S. dollars, 13% in local currency and 5% organically from prior year. And these increases really were driven by strong organic sales in rail mass transit, medical, heavy equipment and factory automation together with contributions from the SSI acquisition that we completed at the beginning of the first quarter.","On a sequential basis, sales increased by 5% as contributions from our SSI offset a slight organic moderation in sales from the fourth quarter, which we had expected. Looking into the second quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these first quarter levels. And for the full year of 2019, we continue to expect high single-digit sales growth resulting from the contributions of our acquisitions together with our organic growth efforts.","Just on emphasize that we remain encouraged by the company\u2019s leading position in the industrial, interconnect and sensors market through both our successful acquisition program as well as our organic innovation. We\u2019ve developed a very broad array of products across a diversified range of exciting segments within the global industrial market. We\u2019re proud of our success thus far, and look forward to realizing the benefits from our efforts in the industrial market for many years to come.","The automotive market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were a bit weaker than we had anticipated coming into the quarter with revenues down 2% in U.S. dollars, up 3% in local currencies and down 4% organically from prior year as the contributions from SSI were offset by slower sales, in particular related to moderated demand in Europe.","Sequentially, our automotive sales increased by 2% as the contributions from SSI offset a sequential moderation in sales from the fourth quarter. Looking into the second quarter, we expect our sales to increase modestly from these levels. For the full year 2019, however, we now do expect sales growth in the mid-single digits, which is a slight reduction from our prior expectations due to an overall lower demand outlook from our automotive customers, in particular those based in Europe.","Nevertheless, we remain encouraged by the company\u2019s strong position in the automotive market. We continue to benefit from our long-term and successful strategy of expanding our range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products, both organically and through acquisitions, all to enable a wide array of onboard electronics across a diversified range of traditional and hybrid electric vehicles supplied by automakers around the world.","In particular, this quarter\u2019s acquisition of Aorora, while relatively small, broadens the range of products we offer for onboard electronics and cars, positioning the company strongly as those new applications continue to proliferate across the automotive electronics market.","Mobile devices market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter. As we had expected coming into the first quarter, sales were down by 10% from prior year and by just over 50% from our very strong fourth quarter and as overall customer demand was reduced from the significant levels we experienced in the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, we did have some growth in tablets, but that was offset by reductions in demand related to both smartphones and laptops. And as we had discussed last quarter, we do believe some of this quarter\u2019s shortfall in sales was related to incremental demand that we experienced in the fourth quarter.","I just want to say how proud I am of our team working in the mobile devices market, just as they managed so successfully the incredible ramp up of demand in the second half of last year, they were able to quickly react to the significant sequential reduction in demand and thereby, protect the financial performance of the company. There is no doubt that the mobile devices market is one of the most volatile segments in the electronics industry and that our team\u2019s agility enables Amphenol to be successful regardless.","Now, looking into the second quarter, we expect demand to remain at approximately these first quarter levels and given our latest outlook from customers in the mobile devices market, including changes in product architecture which have reduced content on certain mobile devices. We now expect a more significant full year sales decline than previously thought, with sales down in the 30% range for the full year. This compares to our previous outlook of a mid to high teens decline for 2019. But as always, our team will be poised to capitalize on any incremental demand opportunities that may arise as the year progresses.","Despite this volatility in demand that we\u2019re seeing here in 2019, we remain encouraged by the company\u2019s outstanding position in the mobile devices market. Our team continues to work diligently on a wide array of next generation mobile devices, including smartphones, laptops, tablets, wearable devices and other accessories. And we\u2019re confident that in the long-term, this market will continue to be a positive contributor to Amphenol\u2019s overall performance.","The mobile networks market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter. Our performance is better than expected in the quarter with sales increasing by 5% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically. A stronger sales to OEMs were only partially offset by a moderation of demand from wireless service providers. Sequentially, sales were down just slightly from the fourth quarter.","Looking ahead, we anticipate second quarter sales to increase in the low double digits from these levels and for the full year, we now expect to realize low double digit sales growth from prior year, as we benefit from the addition of the Charles Industries acquisition. We\u2019re very encouraged by our continued strong performance in the mobile networks market. Our team around the world continues to work aggressively to expand the company\u2019s position with next generation equipment and networks.","And with the addition now of Charles Industries, we\u2019ve significantly broadened our range of products for mobile network operators just as those operators and OEM customers plan for their next generation systems. And we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers around the world. This creates a significant long-term expansion potential for the company.","The information technology and data communications market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the first quarter grew by a better than expected 11% from prior year, driven by strong performance in networking as well as some growth in servers, but partially offset by a moderation demand for storage-related products. Sequentially, our sales were down by a bit less than expected 6% due to what we normally do see in the first quarter \u2013 normal level of seasonality.","Looking into the second quarter, we expect sales to remain at these first quarter levels. And for the full year, we continue to anticipate growth in the low single digits, as the benefits of our acquisitions are offset by a modest moderation of demand that we expect among some customers in the IT market. We\u2019re excited by the benefits of both Charles Industries and the Aorora acquisitions, which bring together added product capabilities to our customers in the IT datacom market.","With these new family members, the company\u2019s already strong technology position has become even broader and more robust and we continue to work with customers around the world to drive their equipment and their networks to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the dramatic increases in demand for particularly bandwidth and processor power. Whether in high speed, power, fiber optics or complex value add interconnect assemblies, we offer the broadest range of products for customers in the IT datacom market.","The broadband market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and our performance in broadband was a bit softer than expected in the first quarter, with sales declining slightly from prior year and by 7% sequentially. These lower sales levels were related to more modest spending by operators in the broadband market.","Looking ahead, we expect sales to increase from these levels in the second quarter. However, for the full year 2019, we now expect sales to be slightly down from 2018 levels on an overall softer operator capital spending. Nevertheless, we remain encouraged by the company\u2019s continually expanding range of products for the broadband market, together with our strong positions with customers around the world. We continue to position Amphenol as the most flexible supplier in the marketplace, thereby ensuring that the company can benefit, should there be any upticks in demand from our customers around the world.","In summary, I just want to say, I\u2019m extremely proud of the company\u2019s performance in the first quarter. Our organization clearly continue to execute well in what is very clearly a dynamic marketplace and in particular, given the ongoing uncertainties in the global economy. Our long-term dual pronged approach of growing both organically and through our acquisition program has resulted in us expanding our market position, while strengthening the company\u2019s financial performance.","Amphenol\u2019s superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across our diverse markets, a broad worldwide presence, our lean and flexible cost structure, a highly effective acquisition program and most importantly, our agile entrepreneurial management team.","Now, turning to our outlook and given the ongoing uncertainty in the global economy and in particular, our reduced outlook in mobile devices which I discussed just a few moments ago, and also based on constant exchange rates, we now expect the following results. For the second quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1.980 billion to $2.020 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.91 to $0.93.","This represents a sales increase versus prior year of flat to 2% in U.S. dollars and 2% to 4% in local currency and an increase versus prior year adjusted diluted EPS of 1% to 3%. For the full year 2019, we now expect sales in the range of $8.130 billion to $8.250 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.80 to $3.86. For the full year, this new guidance represents sales and adjusted diluted EPS performance of down 1% to up 1% and up 1% to up 2% over 2018 levels respectively.","Regardless of the somewhat more muted growth outlook for 2019, I can just tell you that the entire Amphenol team looks forward to driving further strength going forward, even given the many dynamics in the world\u2019s marketplace. I\u2019m confident in the ability of our outstanding management organization to build upon these new performance records across the company and to continue to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability.","And with that operator, we\u2019d be happy to take any questions if there may be.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. The question-and-answer period will now begin. Our first question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Wamsi Mohan","Hi, thank you. Adam, the mobile device market you characterized that as pretty volatile and we\u2019ve seen that in the past as well. Can you characterize for us the change in the guide over the past quarter? Typically the upside or downside in mobile devices have really come into third or fourth quarter because of volume changes and dynamics of timing of launches of major products. Can you maybe talk a little bit about why this larger change is transpiring so early in the year?","And when you talk about architectural changes, I think you mentioned that in your prepared remarks, you guys have been very good at working with customers to capitalize on those changes. So what was different about this architectural change and do you view this more as a cyclical issue or more of a structural issue? Thank you.","Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much Wamsi and appreciate the question. I think your point is very true that when we\u2019ve had that kind of volatility where we\u2019ve been in many cases able to capitalize on demand that has come later in the year, sometimes that has happened when competitors have not been able to satisfy demand or otherwise, I think what I mentioned and what you also alluded to is, we did see here in this quarter as the designs of the products were finalized with our customers, that there were changes to the architecture of some \u2013 of certain products and that ultimately resulted in less content opportunity for the company in those products.","And again that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s not always that content goes always up with every platform, we\u2019ve talked about that many times that every new system has a slightly different design, a slightly different product overlay to it, different natures of opportunities and content. For us and I think in this case, the customer chose to design slightly different way and that had a negative impact on our outlook.","But does it mean that, that this is a kind of a one way ratchet or some permanence to it, absolutely not. I mean, every product gets designed in a slightly different way and I think what we have always said about this market is, we always look for new opportunities to design in our products into new applications and new systems and well, over the long-term, that has been a very favorable trend for us over a very long-term. If you look over a decade, our mobile devices market has averaged growth of more than 8% organically over the last decade because of that long term trend.","But in the short-term, that can go up and that can go down and that\u2019s the inherent nature of the volatility of the market. There\u2019s volatility on content, there\u2019s volatility also on volumes as volatility on winners and losers amongst our customers and that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve dealt with over many, many years and we\u2019ve been able to build long-term a very, very strong business regardless of that.","So as we always do, we always try to update our outlook given what we know in the moment and due to these architectural changes that you mentioned, and that I mentioned earlier, that really drove us to have the outlook that we have produced here today.","Wamsi Mohan","Okay, thanks, Adam. Appreciate that color. And as a quick follow-up, when I think about the strong organic growth that you posted in the quarter of 5%, you\u2019re guiding, a little bit softer growth here in the second quarter. But the full year obviously is more challenged from an organic growth perspective. Would you say that as you look across your diversified business base that this delta really is largely attributable to the shortfall in mobile devices and you feel pretty good about sort of the organic trajectory of the rest of the business.","And I\u2019ve heard the puts and takes across the various businesses seems like, you still have upside on military and commercial aerospace and some of the other end markets attracting more or less in line. Would this be a fair characterization of that?","Adam Norwitt","Yes, I think that\u2019s a fair characterization. I mean, as you mentioned, there were puts and takes as there always are across a diversified range of end markets like we have, which is one of the reasons why diversification is such a core pillar of how we run this company. I mentioned earlier that no market was more than 21% of our sales in the quarter, I think, when you look last year also no market was more than that similar level and this has always been with Amphenol a very, very important principle for us that we tried to stay diversified across markets within those markets across customers to the extent one can and across customers across their applications.","When you look at the more modest organic growth outlook for the year, the math is pretty straightforward. When you have a market that last year was 17% of our sales down 30%, that has a certain magnification on the overall outlook for organic growth and I think across the other markets we have some markets performing at stronger levels and we have others performing a little bit less robust. But that\u2019s the nature of the business and that\u2019s not any categorical change. The big categorical change here in this in our outlook is in fact the mobile devices.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes, thanks. Just a question on SSI. Now, it\u2019s just a few months, but just kind of how that\u2019s performing versus expectations and any anecdotes in terms of growth drivers you just see for that business?","Adam Norwitt","Yes. Thanks very much, Craig. Look, we always love all of our children and we love our new children even better. But I have to tell you, this has been a fabulous acquisition. Craig and I actually just a few weeks back had the opportunity to visit the European operation of SSI, which is in the Czech Republic and just an unbelievable organization of people with fantastic products, great customers and an extremely high technology products.","And the business is going really well, I\u2019d say, it\u2019s performing at or above our expectations for the year. And more importantly, whenever you acquire a company that is really a family company and that, that organization has to transition into not being a family member and where the patriarch in this case who was in quite a senior gentleman when he\u2019s retiring at that time and the management team who is all still there is now part of Amphenol.","I mean, this is always something that we focus very heavily on. I remember we were there the first day that it closed to welcome them all. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time with them over what has now been the better part of four months and the team has truly embraced, being part of the Amphenol organization and we see an enormous amount of activities ongoing between them and other divisions of Amphenol, hunting for that long-term collaborative value, whether that be with customers with technologies, with cost reductions.","I mean, you name it and so, I would say that SSI and the wonderful organization there has embraced our team and vice versa in a way that is actually beyond my expectations and that would lead me to think that long-term the prospects for that business are very good.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. And then just as a follow-up, understand there\u2019s puts and takes by the different end markets, but with a book-to-bill of 1.02 to 1, any comments on just kind of the broader environment that you\u2019re seeing out there kind of how customers are reacting to demand and how their view of inventory at the moment?","Adam Norwitt","Yes, I mean if you look at our book-to-bill, it was strong in the quarter. I mean just over $2 billion in bookings. I mean, you can imagine when you go through the puts and takes of the markets and where we\u2019ve kind of upgraded our outlook and vice versa, that the booking, the stronger book-to-bill would probably be in those markets where we\u2019ve had a bit more of an organic upgrade to our outlook.","So markets like military, markets like commercial air, in particular where we had strong bookings, but we had very robust bookings really across the company and relative to inventory positions, again, we don\u2019t have great visibility as you know. We have some visibility into the distribution channel and we haven\u2019t seen anything out of the ordinary in distribution channel. I guess, I would say that those distributors who are a little more focused on military and aerospace are probably booking at a little bit more aggressive levels. But that\u2019s on the margins, I think by and large we haven\u2019t seen any significant changes or causes for concern in distribution inventory.","I think in the other end markets, it\u2019s more anecdotal. We may have seen \u2013 I talked about in the IT market how we did see for example in storage a little bit of weakness and we did see maybe a few pockets there, where there was some inventory that was built-in and there\u2019s some planning around that. But by and large, I would tell you that the overall position again to the extent that we see it, which is a relatively small extent is nothing so notable.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Matt Sheerin","Yes, thank you. Adam, you commented on the datacom market growth, but you also talked about some moderation in some of the sub-markets there. Could you elaborate on what you\u2019re seeing specifically in the data center? I know you\u2019ve had a lot of success going directly to the hyperscale cloud providers and I know there\u2019s some noise about some inventory build or lumpiness in those markets. So could you give us some more color there?","Adam Norwitt","Yes, I mean, I think what I talked about relative to the sub-markets, we have real strength in networking, we had maybe a little bit less strength in servers and then storage was a bit soft in the quarter. And relative to the hyperscale, and what\u2019s interesting about hyperscale, it is really a service provider model.","So we\u2019re very used to service provider businesses. We service a lot of operators in the mobile networks market and the broadband market. We\u2019ve been involved with that mindset of a service provider for many, many, many years as you know well Matt. And there is a certain volatility, a lumpiness as you term it, in the hyperscale market, which is just natural for service providers. I mean, it turns out that when you\u2019re buying product to manufacture other product. You\u2019re essentially in many times you\u2019re kind of keeping a factory busy, making whatever you\u2019re making, networking equipment or servers or something else.","But when you\u2019re installing data centers and configuring data centers, there is just a lot of other factors that are at play. You\u2019re constructing sometimes things, in the case of the mobile networks market, sometimes weather has an impact, the same is true in broadband. So there\u2019s a lot of other factors besides just build rates that come into play in that hyperscale and I would also say that you don\u2019t have always as many kind of intermediaries, things like contract manufacturers are involved.","And so there can be a little bit more volatility in that space, and I think when we look at our performance this quarter in IT datacom, very, very strong performance, growing by 12% organically actually in the quarter. But our outlook for the second quarter is a more modest outlook and I think, there may be some of what you described that volatility embedded in that outlook. But this is normal, I think it\u2019s not an abnormal thing for an operator driven space.","Matt Sheerin","Got it, okay. Thanks a lot, Adam.","Adam Norwitt","Thanks so much, Matt.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","Shawn Harrison","Afternoon, everybody.","Adam Norwitt","Good afternoon, Shawn.","Shawn Harrison","On the mobile networks business, you took up the guide for the year, the expectation for the year. How much of that was organic versus solely the Charles acquisition, particularly given the strength you saw in the first quarter?","Adam Norwitt","Yes, I\u2019d say the vast majority of the increase was really the Charles acquisition. But we\u2019ve had \u2013 but there is some strength in that market, that was a bit better than we expected in the first quarter. I mean, look, we\u2019re really excited about just the growing array of products that we have in that area. And so whether that performance is coming from the addition of Charles or organically, I would tell you that we just remain very well positioned as operators and as customers, really start to plan for their next generation networks whatever they want to be called.","I mean, I know companies are suing each other over what they call these networks, but let\u2019s say 5G or whatever you want to say here. And I think that the Charles acquisition just brings us an added complement of really sophisticated interconnect enclosures that are used in areas like small cells, in areas like more densified 5G networks and things like that. And so we\u2019re really excited about bring that in. At this moment, it\u2019s a company that we\u2019ve been courting for a long time, it\u2019s a \u2013 it was a family owned company, it\u2019s called Charles Industry because the wonderful gentleman who founded it was a guy named Joe Charles.","And Joe, I spoke to him last night is just an outstanding individual with just vision and drive and running \u2013 and that company that he founded 50 years ago. So this is not a fly by night kind of a business either and we\u2019re just so proud to be the kind of adopted new parents of somebody\u2019s baby that they created and it\u2019s just the fact of how that business has developed and their focus on the mobile networks market in a different area of the interconnect world than what we have, is something that we\u2019re just really, really excited about.","So, I think we had good strength in the quarter organically. I think that translates into a good outlook organically for the year, and then coupled with Charles, I think it brings us really a more favorable position than we thought we would be in coming into the year.","Shawn Harrison","And then as a follow-up on mobile devices, the lower content this year, is that a function of a share loss, where maybe competitors are providing a material type of technology, that just wasn\u2019t something you were focused in on. And how does that play into the kind of 5G knowing, there\u2019ll be more frequencies to the support millimeter wave and that should be, potentially a benefit to Amphenol and its mobile devices business?","Adam Norwitt","Yes, just \u2013 I mean first and foremost, this is not a share loss. I mean, sometimes customers design things with different products that they\u2019re either replacing something with, as you said, maybe a different technology or just not integrating the same type of product. They solve the situation maybe on the board or they solve it somewhere else. And so \u2013 or there\u2019s a different functionality that\u2019s embedded into the product. So this was really a change in the available content for us, not a share loss at all.","And then related to 5G, who knows, I think is the first answer I would give you, which is who knows ultimately what the products, how they\u2019re going to be designed for 5G. But, we have always benefited from enhanced complexity and devices. And so, to the extent that there is more complexity, more signals being generated, more signals that have to be handled inside a mobile device be that a phone, a tablet, a laptop, a wearable, whatever it may be, that\u2019s usually a good thing for us.","I can\u2019t tell you it\u2019s categorically always good at each individual platform or each individual device, but by and large, complexity and added complexity, more signals, more frequencies, in general should be a good trend for Amphenol.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Jim Suva","Thanks very much. Adam, I know you\u2019ve spent a lot of time on the mobility side of things. But, just to kind of help us all, we\u2019re a little bit struggling with it. So maybe one last chance of helping us understand it a little better. It sounds like it was not a competitor undercutting Amphenol on price. You\u2019d mentioned more, it has more to do like available products or available content. Is that because there is like a mix shift down or the newer platforms have less content? Or just trying to figure out about, are the newer smartphones coming out structurally having less content for Amphenol?","Adam Norwitt","Yes. Look, Jim, you\u2019re not at all beating a dead horse there. I know it\u2019s a very important topic for everybody. And again, it\u2019s not a question of us losing share. We were not undercut by anybody. That\u2019s not the case. It was just the customer took a different design approach. I mean, we sell antennas, we sell connectors, we sell mechanical devices into these products. And sometimes for example, a customer will take a different approach to an antenna technology, where they\u2019ll reduce the number of antennas or they\u2019ll change the structure of those antennas.","That\u2019s the type of dynamic that we were dealing with here and that we are dealing with here. Is it \u2013 and it ultimately does result as you correctly term it in less content available for the company on that given set of platforms. But like I said earlier, this doesn\u2019t mean that, that is a one-time shift till time immemorial. I mean, you all know that last year we benefited greatly from an increase in content opportunity that our team did a fabulous job of capitalizing upon really incredible efforts that the team went through in order to ensure that we could support an extraordinary ramp, 90% increase first half to second half last year, which took a lot of doing and then reacting in turn as they\u2019ve done so successfully here in the first quarter.","So this is the nature, as I said earlier, of the volatility of the space. Every product has a little bit of a different design. Each generation can have more or can have less. There can be new competitors, your customer can lose share or gain share. These are all the things that make this market not for the faint of heart, but make us be able to be successful because of that unique agility that our team has.","Jim Suva","Okay. Now I finally get it, Adam. Thank you and then a quick follow up\u2026","Adam Norwitt","I\u2019m glad I helped you there, Jim.","Jim Suva","Yes, thank you. And a quick follow-up, for your reduction for that segment for the year, is it mostly the reduction, I\u2019m talking about only, is the mostly the reduction due to the design change or like a reduction in overall industry demand from like units being consumed out there in the market?","Adam Norwitt","Well, look, I think there it\u2019s \u2013 I think the change that we\u2019re talking about here is mostly due to as I said in my prepared remarks, the sort of architectural change. Is there a little bit less sanguine view of overall volume demand? I think sure, there is a little bit of that as well.","Jim Suva","Thank you so much.","Adam Norwitt","Thanks so much, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deepa Raghavan of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Deepa Raghavan","Good afternoon, guys. Couple of questions from me. I will start with the composition of full year revenue guidance. I look at the flat guidance on revenue and trying to assess what the acquisition versus organic growth probably looks like, looks like acquisition is $300 million contribution, up 3% to 4%. ForEx is a bigger headwind now, maybe 2% down and organic growth is maybe 1% to 2% lower on year-on-year basis as well. Does that sound right to you? Just not very sure what\u2019s in your guide. Appreciate any color.","Craig Lampo","Sure, Deepa. Actually your math is relatively good on that, and not to go into every detail, but I think that basically we described from a bridge perspective from last year to this year from a revenue growth is pretty much on target.","Deepa Raghavan","Thank you. My follow on would be Europe, Adam you talked about weakness in Europe pretty \u2013 but your comments were very specifically rounding around autos being weaker. But just curious if there are any other verticals that have turned softer versus earlier on in the year, can you talk about that. That is a much bigger vertical for you and probably a higher content regional also for you. Thank you very much.","Adam Norwitt","Thank you, Deepa. No, I think I wouldn\u2019t really mention any of our other markets specifically. The only thing I would say is, there are a few pockets of industrial in Europe, which in some of the industrial segments in Europe are a little bit the tails wagged by the dog of the automotive industry, you\u2019d see once in a while. But again, our overall outlook for industrials still remains as robust as we had talked about coming into the year.","So I think within the industrial markets, there have been sort of geographical puts and takes as well, but really where it was most noticed, most obvious was in automotive. Our business is today much more balanced geographically in automotive than it once was. I think you\u2019ll remember well that there was a time when Europe used to be roughly two-thirds of our automotive business and now it\u2019s more balanced. It\u2019s a little bit bigger than the other two regions, which are roughly the same size. But we did see in Europe, a little bit less demand than we had anticipated coming into the quarter.","And I think as we look towards the out quarters, our presumption and expectation on the basis of what we\u2019ve heard from our customers is that Europe may still a little bit underperform the other regions. I mean look, a lot of people much smarter than I, and much more knowledgeable than I have written a lot about that and it\u2019s probably the least well kept secret in the industry that European automotive has a little bit softness to it, but we\u2019re not immune to that, I would say.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is now open.","Steven Fox","Hi, good afternoon. Two quick questions for me, Adam. On the \u2013 you said that you were able to protect wireless margins by reacting quickly to a downturn. Can you give us a sense, does that mean that margins were flat with where they were before, you just had a degradation with volume. Can you give us a little more color on that? Then I had a follow up.","Adam Norwitt","Yes, I mean look, does it mean margins were flat? I mean, we don\u2019t talk about it as margins by each of our markets. But it\u2019s \u2013 I think it would be quite a Superman feat to have flat margins with a 50% reduction in volume. I think what we mean by that Craig talks always about the fact of really driving conversion margins both on the upside and the downside. And I think our team just did a fabulous job of managing those conversion margins.","Thus, I can imagine many organizations, where if your business effectively falls in half in a 90 day period, you have an enormous amount of stranded fixed costs that I think it\u2019d be hard for most businesses just to make money in such an environment and our team just did an excellent job of managing the conversion margins. But it doesn\u2019t mean that the absolute level of profitability at that 50% lower volume level is the same as it was in the fourth quarter.","Steven Fox","That\u2019s helpful, I appreciate that color. And then on the enclosures acquisition, obviously there\u2019s a lot of interconnect areas that you\u2019ve gone into that have added value to the business. When you think about enclosures now, with this acquisition, does it brought in your acquisition lends out any further. Are you thinking more of that other markets for enclosures or is this more of a specific niche that you plan on focusing on? Thanks.","Adam Norwitt","Well, thanks. I mean look, this is actually not a new area for us necessarily. I mean, you\u2019ll recall that we\u2019ve made a few other outstanding acquisitions over the recent years, acquired a company called All Systems Broadband and we acquired subsequently a company called Telect. And those companies were really involved in complex interconnect enclosures more for indoor applications, inside data centers, inside telecommunications, indoor applications. And what Charles brings us is a very similar product actually to those that we have acquired before with Telect and All Systems Broadband. But it does that in a harsh environment application.","And in particular, what you see more and more as for example in the wireless market, as people move more toward small cells, more densified networks, where there\u2019s a lot more outdoor requirements, that \u2013 there\u2019s just not the place to put things indoors anymore. And you have to have a high technology packaging for those, so that you can get this complex interconnect into the side of the place right near where the tower goes or right where the junction goes to the house or to the tower or to the distribution point.","And so Charles has just this very unique high technology harsh environment, interconnect enclosures, which is very complementary to the more data center indoor applications, that we got from Telect. So it\u2019s not that we have a strategy that says, we\u2019re going to go be an enclosure company at all. I mean, this is really high technology interconnect products together with the enclosures that go around that and that really rugged eyes and protect those interconnect products wherever they maybe situated. So it\u2019s really on a continuum.","Charles and we\u2019ve been very pleased with the performance and the reception from our customers of both All Systems Broadband and Telect and now together with Charles, we really have a complete offering both indoor and outdoor when customers need those really complex interconnect systems.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Mark Delaney","Yes, good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. I do have two. The first was hoping to get your perspective on the macroeconomic environment specifically in China. There\u2019s been quite an array of data points, some quite weak, others you mean to suggest there are some to see improvement in the China macro economic situation, so hoping to get perspective from Amphenol and what you may be seeing with your orders as it relates to the China region?","Adam Norwitt","Yeah, I mean, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re \u2013 we have any different view on China. I think \u2013 you characterized it Mark, it sounds like a pretty fair characterization, but \u2013 which would be by the way the same characterization around the world, I mean, there are some areas of strength and some areas of weakness. I think people talked broadly about Asia and China in particular in automotive and there\u2019s been a lot written about that. I mean, I would say that our performance in Asia was not our strongest region.","I highlighted Europe \u2013 I mean, our strongest automotive performance was really in North America in the quarter. But you know, by the same token we had strong performance in IT datacom in Asia and in China as well. So I don\u2019t know that there is one general conclusion. I mean, one thing I will say, Craig and I were there a few weeks ago and there still seems to be a lot of Ferraris and Bugattis driving around Shanghai. So it doesn\u2019t seem like anything is falling totally off of the cliff.","Mark Delaney","I understand, that\u2019s helpful. And then a follow-up question for Craig on EBIT margins in the second half of the year. It seems like revenue will be down year-over-year given the already discussed mobility dynamic. So, typically that all else equal will help margins. But, I know there are some of these puts and takes volumes overall seem lower. You got some new acquisitions coming in. So maybe just help us think about sort of the puts and takes to EBIT margins for 2H? Thank you.","Craig Lampo","Sure, no problem. So, yes, I think if you look at our full year guidance and certainly, the second half of the year is \u2013 will be \u2013 it\u2019s going to be impacting that. Basically what you see is organic reduction, there\u2019s a few puts and takes on that. Number one is obviously the normal range of conversion kind of year-over-year on our organic sales reduction that we talked about a little bit, a point or two is organic sales reduction. But actually that the bigger impact is, I think that if you looked at the range of conversion on that is actually relatively quite low on an implied basis.","It\u2019s really the reduction from our EBIT perspective is more impacted by the acquisitions, Charles and SSI and Aorora, collectively are slightly below the company average and that certainly has some impact on, not only the second half but also on the second quarter and even to a certain degree on the first quarter as relates to SSI.","So, those are the things that ultimately are impacting the EBIT margin on a year-over-year basis. But, what we do have to say is that I\u2019m extremely proud actually of the team and specifically the mobile device team and as Adam before mentioned being able to really react in an amazing way to this reduction in volume that, they saw number one in the first quarter as it compares to the fourth quarter in addition to the reduction that they\u2019re seeing, kind of just for the full year and to be able to deal with this and protect their margins on the bottom \u2013 on to the bottom line.","And I think you infer that ultimately the mobile device market ultimately is a little bit less profitable from a margin perspective than in other markets. But I would say that we never said that as a company, I think as the company average, we said that in all our markets with an expectation perception of broadband really has, in a range of similar margins. So, I wouldn\u2019t say the fact that they\u2019re down 30% really is having an overall impact in the company. But, what I would say is that, if we didn\u2019t do such a good job in terms of the management team in dealing with this reduction, then there could have been a more significant impact and there really is in the margins that we see right now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of William Stein of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","William Stein","Great. Thanks for taking my question. I understand from industry context, there is a growing adoption of 48 volt technology in both datacenter and automotive applications, maybe automotive moving slower but still happening. I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s an impact on Amphenol\u2019s business from this trend in particular. Thank you.","Adam Norwitt","Yes, I mean, well, you always have these great insights into tech, which is wonderful to see. Yes, no question, I mean, we\u2019ve been working on 48 volt applications in auto, in data center and other areas. And the underlying driver is just there\u2019s just so much more stuff going on in these systems. And when you get to all the different things, just the typical, say 12 volt in the car, for example, just can\u2019t support it, the network cannot support all these different applications, that are drawing power.","And so does that have implications from an interconnect perspective, I think absolutely it does. I think that there any time when you have that kind of generational shift either in power or in bandwidth of data or frequency as it relates to RF. I mean, these are the things that connector companies really live for, is really helping customers to enable those transformations, helping to \u2013 helping your customers to figure out what the ramifications of that are, what the \u2013 how you have to test and validate and secure the systems, so that they\u2019re equally safe as they were in the past. And so, our team around the world as they are on any of these technological evolutions or revolutions, they\u2019re working very closely with a number of customers all over the place.","William Stein","Great, thank you.","Adam Norwitt","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Joseph Giordano of Cowen. Your line is now open.","Joseph Giordano","Hey, guys. Good afternoon.","Adam Norwitt","Good afternoon, Joe.","Joseph Giordano","Hey, so I wanted to just dig in on auto a little bit. I mean, I know you lowered your overall full year expectations, but at the end of the day given this production environment, that\u2019s going to end up looking pretty good versus most who participate in that space. I was curious if you can maybe talk at a high level about, whether it\u2019s regionally \u2013 is the content that you\u2019re doing of both the production, is that fairly balanced regionally? And kind of curious if you can give some color into how that portfolio looks now whether connectors versus sensors versus antennas and is one growing faster than another in terms of content? Is there major variations there that we should be thinking about?","Adam Norwitt","Yes, no, I think first of all, I appreciate the comments and we do feel very good about the progress of our automotive business even when we were a little disappointed with the performance in the quarter. We pulled a little bit down the outlook for the year. I mean that does not reflect any disappointment with our progress and position in that marketplace, which is a very, very strong progress and excellent position.","On a regional basis, I wouldn\u2019t tell you that there are regional differences in content, because the expansion of content, the sort of revolution of new applications being put into car, things like whether that\u2019s hybrid electric vehicle, whether that\u2019s new drive systems, whether that\u2019s new electronics, new communications systems, new interfaces of passengers, new types of control systems for transmissions, and engines, and braking and all of that. I mean, there\u2019s such an extraordinary array of different things happening in cars.","And I don\u2019t think that any one region has a disproportionate adoption, with maybe the only exception I would say is that the China EV market is certainly a more fluid market where there\u2019s a lot more players. And so there\u2019s a lot going on there and our team has done a really excellent job in that space. But in terms of overall content in cars, I don\u2019t personally believe that there is a real differentiation on a regional basis.","Relative to our products and you correctly categorized them, interconnect products and sensors and antennas, I think they all are seeing great opportunities. And so, I wouldn\u2019t say again that one of them has a disproportionate progress. I think they\u2019re all playing a role in the enabling of that advanced content in cars, in all the various regions. And we\u2019re just really pleased as we continue to build out the product range for the company and that includes in this quarter, with the acquisition of Aurora, which again, albeit a small company, they make unique products that are used especially in next generation onboard electronics and embedded computing in cars.","And I think that, that just adds to what is already and has already become a very broad range of products and very well, you\u2019ve covered the company long enough to see that over the last decade we\u2019ve really built that out, both organically and through acquisitions. And we continue to be on the hunt for next \u2013 the next sort of complementary product across those various product categories to allow us to be more important to our customers, to allow us to participate more strongly in that next generation electronics and that\u2019s what Aurora is an indication of and we\u2019ll continue to drive a strategy that way going forward.","Joseph Giordano","Great, and then maybe one kind of basic one on mobile device. I mean, I feel like you\u2019re the first one to say that you kind of have no idea how to model that part of business forward, because of how volatile it can be. But you\u2019ve given what we talked about on the call here, moving your \u2013 moving your target down 30, like if you had a handicap, what\u2019s more likely from that spot. Would it be more likely to move that down further or up further? Do you have a sense for feel there? I mean, last year if I think about it was like, we started that low single digit and ended up 40%. So just kind of thinking of how that \u2013 how we handicap this one?","Adam Norwitt","Yes. Look, I\u2019m not a golfer, so I don\u2019t know about handicapping. We have always approached this in a very simple sense, which is we\u2019ve always tried to communicate to our shareholders and to the world the best that we can at the time when we\u2019ve made that communication. And so to tell you right now that we\u2019re going to be better or worse than the 30%, I couldn\u2019t tell you. We think right now that our outlook is \u2013 this is the best outlook that we have at this moment on the basis of all the information that we have. I think that it remains a volatile market and I think our team remains uniquely able to capitalize or deal with the changes as they make up. And that\u2019s the best we can do at this moment and thank goodness, I don\u2019t have to play golf and deal with handicaps. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you.

Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the Company, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce today\u2019s conference host, Ms. Diana Reardon. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.","Diana Reardon","Thank you. Good afternoon. My name is Diana Reardon, and I\u2019m Amphenol\u2019s CFO. I\u2019m here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we\u2019d like to welcome everyone to our first quarter call.","Q1 results were released this morning. I\u2019ll provide some financial commentary on the quarter and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We\u2019ll then have a question-and-answer session.","The company closed the first quarter with sales of $1.327 billion and $0.057 of earnings, meeting the high-end of the Company\u2019s guidance. Sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies compared to Q1 of 2014. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency impacts, sales in Q1 2015 were up 5%. Sequentially, sales were down 7% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically from Q4 of 2014.","Breaking down sales into our two major components, our cable business, which comprise 6% of our sales in the quarter was down 3% from last year. Our interconnect business, which comprises 94% of our sales, was up 17% from last year, reflecting the benefits of both good organic growth and the company\u2019s acquisition program. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.","Turning to operating income, operating income increased to $260 million in the quarter. Operating margin increased to 19.6% compared to 18.8% last year excluding one-time items, a strong year-over-year conversion margin on incremental sales of 32%. The increase of 80 basis points in operating margins over the prior year resulted from an increase in profitability in our interconnect business.","From a segment standpoint, in the cable segment, margins were 12.1% compared to 12.2% last quarter. In the interconnect business, margins were 21.8%, up 90 basis points from 20.9% last year. The improvement in ROS reflects excellent operating execution both organically and in our acquisitions in addition to aggressive cost management.","We\u2019re very pleased with the Company\u2019s operating margin achievement. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company\u2019s entrepreneurial management team which continues to foster a high performance action oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in what clearly continues to be a very dynamic global environment.","To the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry leading operating margins and remained fully committed to driving enhanced performance.","Interest expense for the quarter was $17 million compared to $19 million last year, reflecting the benefit of a lower average effective interest rate in the current quarter, more than offsetting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the Company\u2019s acquisition and stock buyback programs.","The lower average rate is the result of a new note issuance in September replacing a higher cost net maturity in November of last year and the implementation of a new commercial paper program. Other income was $4.1 million in the quarter, equal to last year and consists primarily of interest income on cash and short-term cash investments. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate, excluding the impact of one-time items with 26.5% in both Q1 of 2015 and Q1 of 2014. Including the impact of one-time items, the 2014 rate was 26.4%.","Net income in the quarter was approximately 14% of sales and EPS excluding one-time items increased 14%, an excellent performance. On as reported basis earnings per share in the 2014 period included a charge of $2 million or $0.01 for acquisition related cost. Orders in the quarter were $1.34 billion, up 2% from last year, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.01 to 1.","The company continues to be a strong generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $188 million in the quarter, or about 104% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income.","From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $871 million at the end of the March, up slightly from September. Inventory days were 87 days, up seven days from December levels and at the high end of our normal range. The higher inventory level supports a future step up in certain parts of the business and we expect inventory days to decline going forward.","Accounts receivable was $1.1 billion at the end of March, down about 3% from December. Days sales outstanding were 75 days, up four days from December and at the high end of our normal range. Accounts payable was $583 million at the end of March, down about 6% from December levels, and payable days were 58 days, up one day compared to December.","The cash flow from operations along with proceeds from our commercial paper program of $86 million and $20 million of proceeds from stock option exercises were used primarily to purchase $62 million of the Company\u2019s common stock to fund net capital expenditures of $40 million, to fund acquisition payments of $76 million relating both to the Invotec acquisition and the final payment on a 2014 acquisition and to fund $78 million in dividend payments during the quarter including the funding of both the Q1 and Q2 dividends. During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.1 million shares under its January 2015 10-million-share stock repurchase program and 8.9 million shares remain available at the end of March under the program which expires in January of 2017.","Cash and short-term investments were $1.4 billion at the end of March, majority of which is held outside the U.S. Our total debt was $2.8 billion, bringing net debt at the end of the quarter to $1.4 billion. The company had issued $753 million under its $1.5 billion commercial paper program at the end of the quarter and EBITDA for Q1 2015 was approximately $300 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter.","Before I turn the call over to Adam, I\u2019d like to make a few comments relative to our guidance. As noted in the press release, we\u2019ve updated our 2015 guidance range to sales of $5.50 million to $5.62 billion and earnings of $2.41 to $2.47. This is a sales growth of 3% to 5% both in U.S. dollars and organically and 7% to 9% from a local currency standpoint. EPS growth is 7% to 10%.","This guidance is based on current exchange rates reflecting the negative impact of the significantly stronger dollar and the addition of the acquisition of Invotec which we closed in the quarter. The negative translation impact caused by the significant strengthening of the dollar in relation in the euro and certain other currencies since our last guidance has been impact of reducing 2015 guidance by about $65 million in sales and about $0.03 in earnings.","For the full year 2015 compared to 2014, we now expect a drag of about $225 million or 4% of sales from the negative effects of translation and an impact of about $0.10 in earnings. The Invotec acquisition that closed in the quarter adds about $30 million in sales and $0.01 in earnings.","From an organic growth perspective, we\u2019d increased our growth range from 2% to 5% in our previous guidance to 3% to 5% in our current guidance. And Adam will talk about trends by market in more detail in a moment.","I would just add here that we have reflected some shift in demand in the wireless markets in our guidance. Those wireless markets were previously expected to be relatively flat in 2015. However, we now expect a decline in the mobile network market in the low-teens and a high single-digit growth in sales in the mobile device market with the majority of that growth expected in the second half of 2015.","I will also just note relative to the Q2 guidance that from a sequential standpoint at the high end of guidance, sales were up 2% in U.S. dollars and 3% organically with the negative translation impact from the stronger dollar reducing sales by about 1%.","From an organic standpoint, the 3% sequential growth in Q2 sales is somewhat lower than our normal seasonality. This results from our current expectations that the wireless market will be relatively flat sequentially. Historically, both markets normally increased sequentially going into Q2. However, as I mentioned earlier, we now see a softer demand in the mobile network market for the year and therefore do not expect the normal seasonal uptick in Q2.","And in the mobile devices market, we now see a flat sequential performance in Q2 based primarily on program timing before a significant strengthening in the second half of 2015.","Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends.","Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much, Diana. And let me also add my welcome to those of you on the call today. As Diana mentioned I\u2019m going to highlight some of our first quarter achievements and then I\u2019ll spend some time to discuss their trends and progress across our diverse served markets. Then finally, I\u2019ll make a couple of comments on our outlook for the second quarter, as well as for the full year.","With respect to the first quarter, I\u2019m just very pleased to report that our sales and EPS were both at the high end of guidance and that\u2019s despite a challenging economic environment, as well as the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar. Our sales increased 7% from prior year in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies, reaching that $1.327 billion. And orders at $1.340 billion were a book-to-bill of 1.01 to 1 which is an encouraging sign. Our profitability in the quarter continues to be very strong as we generated operating margins of 19.6% which as Diana mentioned is an 80-basis-point increase from prior year. And our EPS grew 14% from prior year essentially despite the rate of our sales growth.","I just want to say that I\u2019m extremely proud of our global team who was once again able to react quickly to the many opportunities that are being created by the electronics revolution, all the while exercising the discipline and drive necessary to achieve outstanding operating performance. And I think our strong results in this first quarter once again demonstrate the benefits of the company\u2019s outstanding entrepreneurial culture.","I\u2019m very pleased in the quarter that we completed the acquisition of Invotec during the first quarter. And Invotec is the leading UK based manufacturer of highly engineered, harsh environment, printed circuit boards, flex circuits and related assemblies for the aerospace, defense and industrial markets, that has annual sales of roughly $35 million.","Importantly, Invotec represents an outstanding complement to our North American PCB and flex circuit capabilities and positions us to take further advantage of the ongoing drive to proliferate this technology in important aerospace and industrial applications and that is a trend that we\u2019re really seeing across our global customer base in that space. We\u2019re very excited to welcome the outstanding Invotec to Amphenol and we look forward to continuing to create value in the future with our very successful acquisition program.","Turning to our trends and progress across our served markets, I just want to comment first that once again our balanced and broad end market diversification supported the Company\u2019s excellent performance in the first quarter. And we\u2019re particularly pleased that no single market represented more than 18% of total sales in the quarter.","The fact that the company\u2019s diversification across electronics industry and areas with the wide variety of technology requirements, product lifecycles and underlying drivers has consistently been an underlying creator of long-term value for the company.","Turning to those markets, first the military market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were flat the prior year in U.S. dollars and increased by 3% in local currency, led by increases in communications, vehicle and rotorcraft related products. Sequentially, as we had expected, sales were down into mid-single-digits. Looking ahead for the second quarter, we expect sales to increase moderately from these levels and we remain confident in achieving full year growth in constant currency in the military market.","That\u2019s true that military budgets overall appear to have stabilized, but at the same time, they\u2019re clearly not expanding. Nevertheless, our technology leadership and our broad program participation have enabled us to realize the growth we experienced in the first quarter and have positioned the company to benefit long term from the expanding adoption of electronics in military hardware, as well as from stronger spending trends in emerging geographies.","So commercial aviation market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were up slightly in local currency and declined by 6% in U.S. dollars on what was positive growth rates of the components used in the production by the leading aircraft manufacturers.","Sequentially, sales reduced seasonally by 7% on lower production volumes. Despite this moderating rate of growth, we remain confident that our commercial air sales will grow in the second quarter from these first quarter levels, and for the full year, we continue to expect to achieve robust organic growth, in particular with the anticipated second half ramp-up of certain new airplane platforms. The world\u2019s airlines continue to demand planes that are more fuel-efficient and that created passenger flying experience, leaving aircraft manufacturers to incorporate an increasing range of complex, new technologies into their latest generation airliners.","We extremely are well positioned to enable these technologies with our Interconnect, value-add cable, and printed circuit assemblies and cable management products. This combination creates an exciting, long-term expansion opportunity for Amphenol.","The industrial market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter which is strong growth of 10% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency, compared to prior year and 3% in local currency sequentially. This increase in our sales was driven by excellent performance in the heavy equipment, alternative energy and medical segments, as well as by contributions from the Goldstar acquisition that we completed in the fourth quarter. And that growth was partially offset by an expected decline in sales to oil and gas customers, that\u2019s related to lower levels of exploration and drilling due to the recently reduced commodity prices.","Looking ahead, we expect sales in the industrial market to increase from these levels in the second quarter, and we continue to anticipate a double-digit sales growth in local currencies for the full year 2015. Long term, we look forward to realizing the benefits of our broad, industrial, interconnect and sensor product offerings, together with our diversified presence across the many exciting segments of the global industrial market.","The automotive market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter and we experienced again a significant increase in sales from prior year, growing 31% and 14%, organically as we continue to benefit from the Casco acquisition made last year in the third quarter. And as we grew our sales of new products used in telematics emissions management, and drive train control applications. Sales were essentially flat sequentially in U.S. dollars but they grew by 4% on a local currency basis from the fourth quarter.","We\u2019re very pleased to be continuing to outgrow the overall automotive electronics market, as we capitalize on our broadened suite of interconnect and sensor technologies which are being incorporated into a wide array of new and complex vehicle electronics.","With the additions of techbox, Advance Sensors in Casco, during the last 18 months, we have significantly expanded our product offering across a wide array of new electronics applications in cars. In addition, we have organically expanded into a variety of new discreet connectors and advanced value-add interconnect systems, thereby positioning the Company for continued excellent long-term growth. Looking towards the second quarter, we expect sales in the automotive market to increase further from these levels and we continue to look forward to an excellent 2015 and beyond for this exciting business.","The mobile devices market represented 15% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased 5% from prior year and declined as we had expected by roughly 28% sequentially, driven by post-holiday seasonality.","I can just say I\u2019m so proud of our mobile devices team who had once again quickly flex their resources given these significant volume changes, all while still preserving strong operating performance, as well as very importantly, preserving the ability to expand our capacity for growth expected in the second half of 2015. This organizational agility remains a core advantage of Amphenol in the extremely dynamic mobile devices market.","As Diana mentioned, while we expect sales to remain at current levels in the second quarter, we now have a more positive view of the demand potential in the mobile devices market in the second half of this year. Thus, we now anticipate achieving growth for the full year of 2015 somewhere in the mid-single digits. And we remain confident that despite the ever-changing landscape across the mobile devices market, our leading technology preferred supplier relationships with a broad range of device markers, and most importantly, the excellent execution of our outstanding agile organization positions us extremely well for the future.","The mobile networks market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter and sales declined as we had expected by about 9% from prior year in U.S. dollars and 4% in the local currencies and by 5% sequentially as operators further moderated their network build-out activities in most geographies after last year\u2019s significant infrastructure investments.","As Diana mentioned earlier, based on the latest information that we received from our OEM and service provider customers, we now expect only a slight increase from these demand levels in the second quarter if not flat performance and due anticipate a decline in our mobile network sales for the full year of 2015.","Regardless of these more muted sales expectations, we remain extremely well-positioned in the mobile networks market and are thus very confident that with our industry-leading breadth of interconnect and antenna products, we will continue to participate broadly in ongoing next-generation mobile network deployments around the world.","The information technology and datacom market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter and sales in this market increased by a greater than expected 6% from prior year due to strengthening sales of our wide range of high-speed products incorporated into a broad range of data center equipment. Sequentially, our sales were flat due to a seasonally stronger fourth quarter. And looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect sales to grow slightly from these levels and we continue to anticipate full-year growth in the IT datacom market in the mid-single-digits.","This IT market is really undergoing a rapid transformation as cloud and web service providers are driving new innovations across the entire architecture of data centers really around the world. Amidst this dynamic environment, we remain encouraged by our industry-leading high-speed and power products, our preferred relationships with leading equipment suppliers and our enhanced and direct focus on service provider and data center customers, all of which have created a platform for us to continue to outperform in the future in this important market.","The broadband communications market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter. And as we had expected, sales declined slightly from prior year on the moderation of spending from U.S. cable operators and were essentially flat to the fourth quarter.","While we do expect a slight increase in demand in the second quarter, we now expect more moderate growth in the broadband markets for the full year 2015. As there really remains the heightened level of uncertainty in the capital spending plans of many of the MSO, satellite and telecommunication customers in the space and that\u2019s in particular given the several high profile industry mergers which are still at this stage pending after a long time. Nevertheless, we remain confident that we will realize long-term success in this market due to our proven capability to create innovative solutions for our customers in support of the rapid growth of especially high speed data delivery. As we drive further efforts to create these enabling technologies, we look forward to maintaining our leadership position in the broadband market.","So in summary, with respect for the first quarter, I\u2019m just extremely proud of the Amphenol organization as we once again executed very well in a challenging and dynamic environment. Our continued strong performance in 2015 is another clear reflection of the Company\u2019s distinct competitive advantages, our broad range of leading technologies, our balanced and comprehensive market diversification, our worldwide presence and our lean and flexible cost structure. But above all of these strengths, simply our greatest asset remains a high performance culture that is reinforced everyday by Amphenol\u2019s agile, entrepreneurial management team.","Now turning to outlook and just to reiterate some of the comments Diana made, there continues to still be significant uncertainties across the global marketplace that\u2019s reflected in part by the ongoing weakening of certain overseas currencies. Accordingly and based on a continuation of these current economic conditions and assuming also that exchange rates remain stable at these latest levels, we now expect in the second quarter and the full year 2015 the following results.","For the second quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1.315 billion to $1.355 billion and EPS in the range of $0.56 to $0.58, respectively. This represents a sales increase versus prior year of flat to 3% in U.S. dollars, and 5% to 8% in local currency and an EPS increase of 4% to 7%. For the full year of 2015, we expect sales in the range of $5.5 billion to $5.62 billion, which is an increase of 3% to 5% in U.S. dollars and 7% to 9% in local currencies. And we expect 2015 EPS of $2.41 to $2.47 which represents an increase of 7% to 10% over 2014, excluding one-time items.","We are very encouraged by the Company\u2019s continued strong outlook in sales and earnings especially given the many uncertainties in the global marketplace, and it is really the ongoing revolution in electronics that continue to create tremendous opportunities for Amphenol. And I\u2019m very confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to continue to capitalize on these opportunities to grow our market position and to expand our profitability, and thereby, to drive continued superior performance for the Company in 2015 and beyond.","With that, operator, we\u2019d be very happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Participants we\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from the line of Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is open.","Jim Suva","Thank you and congratulations to your team at Amphenol. Really great result, especially considering the currency and the changes.","Adam Norwitt","Thank you.","Jim Suva","Diana and Adam, can you help us understand a little bit more granularity on your comments around the mobility? You mentioned some softness. Is this broad based global, is it geographic, is it more like smartphone handset, or tablet, or notebook, or how should we think about that commentary?","Adam Norwitt","Yes. Jim, thank you very much. I think we talked about mobility and mobile from two standpoints. One is the mobile networks markets where we do have a more moderate view of that market, as well as the mobile devices market where, I think, we have somewhat stronger view than we previously had. So, I assume what you\u2019re asking is relative to our comments on mobile networks. And in mobile networks, I think, what we have seen is last year, there was just tremendous performance in that market. You know that we grew last year by 24% over prior year, which is really far in excess of many of the statistics that one saw coming out of equipment manufacturers or the various capital spending results of the operators around the world, and I think that was just a great confirmation of the efforts that we\u2019ve made over many years to broaden our product offering in support of these new technologies in these next generation systems.","But no doubt about it, that was a lot of build out that happened last year and I think what we\u2019re seeing on a global basis really is that the operators are really working to digest those investments, in particular here in the first half, but even throughout the year, more maybe than we would have thought previously.","From a regional standpoint, last year we saw good growth in all of the regions, probably saw a little bit better in Asia but we had strong double-digit growth in every region. I think in this quarter, we probably saw a bit more magnified reductions in Europe, and some reductions in North America. We actually still saw some element of continued strength on a year-over-year basis in Asia. I think for the full year, we would probably anticipate that all the regions would still be in that kind of digestion phase of their investments. But perhaps, maybe Europe would be a little bit weaker than Asia, for example.","Relative to mobile devices, again, we are seeing more strength in that space and that just comes down to our organization\u2019s fantastic ability to continue to win programs at the leading device manufacturers. I think we did talked about last year, that we saw a little bit, worst performance last year in tablets, a little bit better performance maybe in things like ultrabooks and we\u2019ve seen good performance with some of the new smartphone manufacturers, as well as some of the accessories around those products. And I think that those trends are largely continuing coming into 2015 and we probably wouldn\u2019t expect a much different performance across that market this year.","Jim Suva","Great. And as a very quick follow-up, your acquisition. A lot of times when we hear printed circuit board companies, we think they\u2019re a very low margin business. Am I correct by assuming that this company is a lot more than just printed circuit boards and lot higher value add, and maybe give us a little bit of a flavor or color into, if that\u2019s a [ph] correct statement, more than just printed circuit boards.","Adam Norwitt","Now, this is an outstanding question, Jim. And it\u2019s very true that there is a whole industry of printed circuit boards and that\u2019s not an industry that we have in large part participated in. But we do have a business in very high reliability, harsh environment, printed circuits, be it flex or rigid flex or rigid boards, and the related assemblies that is really active in the military area space and industrial space. And that\u2019s what this company is. And so it\u2019s by no means a big entry into printed circuits, rather it\u2019s a continuation of our approach to present a total interconnect solutions for those very high-reliability application that we see in particular in aerospace, military and industrial.","One trend that we have seen and we have been really one of the drivers of that trend from a very high technology standpoint is there are applications, in particular in those harsh environments, where traditionally those have been managed through big cable bundles. And that those cable bundles are over timed in certain of those applications being migrated towards a more of a printed circuit technology that integrates connectors and integrate that whole assembly and allows the customers to have a better vibration proof and a more kind of certainty of the application than they would have had in the past.","That\u2019s a very, very long term trend that we see and it\u2019s one that we\u2019re really at the forefront of working with leading customers around the world on enabling. Previously, we had that capability predominantly in North America and the Invotec acquisition gives us that high value-add, high technology opportunity to support customers also in Europe. And so it\u2019s very, very much consistent with that strategy. You could call it a little bit of a niche strategy in that broader printed circuit area, but it\u2019s very complementary to our overall value-add interconnect offering to those customers.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sherri Scribner","Hi. Diana, I just wanted to bridge the full-year revenue guidance versus what you\u2019ve said a couple of months ago to what you\u2019re saying now. It looks like you add the acquisition back. You add the modestly [ph], you had this quarter and then you take out the FX impact, it\u2019s mostly the same guidance. I just want to make sure that I\u2019m understanding that correctly, it seems like mostly that changes the acquisition and FX impact.","Diana Reardon","Sure. I think that\u2019s the right way to look at it. I think at the high end, that\u2019s exactly right. It\u2019s the same guidance adjusted for FX impact and adding in the Invotec acquisition. And from a low end of guidance, we\u2019ve increased the range from 2% to 5% organic growth to 3% to 5%. So I think the way you\u2019ve described is correct.","Sherri Scribner","Okay. Thanks. And then I guess just for the second quarter guidance, it seems a little \u2013 it seems like the seasonality is a bit less than you would typically see. Usually you see sales increased sort of in the mid-single-digit. On a sequential basis, what\u2019s really driving that? And then I guess, what\u2019s the strengths that drives growth in the second half of the year? Obviously, mobile devices to some extent, I just want to get a little more color. Thanks.","Diana Reardon","Sure. I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect in the second quarter to look sequentially. We expect not to see the normal sequential increase in the wireless market. The wireless network market, due to the fact that we now see a year-over-year decline in that market and I think Adam just described pretty well what is going on there.","In terms of the mobile device market, we actually do have a more positive view of that market and expect now that that market will be up in the mid-single-digit \u2013 range for the year. But in the second quarter, due to program timing, again we expect that market to be flat. And then as we move into Q3 and Q4, the second half of the year, we expect to see a significant strengthening in that market.","And that\u2019s why you see a little bit less than what our normal sequential seasonality would be in Q2 and we\u2019ll have a little bit higher than normal seasonality if you will when we move into Q3 in the second half of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Shawn Harrison","Hi. Good afternoon. I guess, kind of going back to the first question is on mobile, twofold on devices, am I correct, is it solely content gains which give you the bullish view on the second half of the year versus a better volume outlook for the device market? And then, second on networks, is it \u2013 is there an inventory issue of Amphenol products or is it that there\u2019s an inventory issue of end products being put into the market? I just wanted to be clear on that versus just lack of deployment of base stations and associated equipment for the year.","Adam Norwitt","Shawn, thank you very much. Just relative to mobile devices, it\u2019s hard for us to always say is it content gains? Is it new wins on new programs? Is it more content on programs that we already had content? I think the best is to say that we\u2019re doing an excellent job of maximizing our content on as many devices as we can, and we have a lot of devices in the space.","So to sort of parse it out and say which is content and which is totally new things and which are volume expectations. But I think that the team is just doing a fabulous job to gain position on coming programs in which we have a lot of confidence as well on programs that we really start to see and start to really see in the pipeline.","Relative to mobile networks, I mean, I don\u2019t know necessarily that I would call it an inventory although there certainly may be end inventory in the channel, of base stations and things like that. I mean, that\u2019s very common when you have a big capital spending year followed by some reductions and that some of the equipment manufacturers may very well have some inventory.","But I think if you just look at the capital spending plan that are widely reported, there are many of those that do reflect some significant downturns. I think there are some of those operators as well who are also involved in some of these broadly reported corporate mergers and whether that is keeping some governor on their spending plans. That\u2019s something they know that I don\u2019t know. But there are certainly some moving pieces going on strategically in the industry.","I think all that being said, we feel that our position in that space, that our position with customers is really stronger than it was before and one thing I\u2019ll say is when you look at our performance last year, we did such a fabulous job in a time of high growth than demand to satisfy customers. They don\u2019t forget that. They really don\u2019t forget it. And so when that spending comes, and it will come, they will always remember who was there for them and who reacted quickly, who didn\u2019t caused their crews to not have the parts when they needed them in the field. And that will reflect positively on our ability to continue to gain position in the mobile networks market long-term.","Shawn Harrison","Very helpful, and if I may just may one brief follow-up, it seems as if private party multiples \u2013 private market multiples on sensor companies has gone a bit sky-high over the past six to 12 months, is that anyway change your thinking about the opportunities in that market near-term knowing that you guys are typically a very stood acquirer?","Adam Norwitt","Pretty safe to compliment look we\u2019re not a bottom feeder, we are still an acquirer, we pay fair multiple for a good companies and we have bought many companies in many different valuation cycles. So whether there are a few data points over the last twelve months that reflect may be higher multiples than we would necessarily have paid, does that change the landscape for Amphenol? Absolutely not, we continue to have a fabulous reputation among sellers, both financial sponsor sellers, as well as real owner, managers of companies.","As a company that does what it says, keeps it word, executes quickly, pays a fair price and is a fabulous home ultimately for those companies. And I think that that\u2019s the one who pays only the highest price doesn\u2019t win in every instance. There are some instances where they do win and if someone wants to pay a much higher price than us, in certain occasions, we\u2019ll be happily not buying those companies. But I think that there still remain a lot opportunities for us to acquire great companies using our consistent methodology which hasn\u2019t changed over the years. And we have not chased kind of market multiples as you know very well, regardless of what cycle that we\u2019re in. We view this as a real long-term game. When you\u2019re buying a company you\u2019re buying it in our world that leads for life. And you don\u2019t sort of buy opportunistically when things are cheap and not buy when things are expensive and you don\u2019t only buy because of short-term dynamics that are at play. We feel very confident that long-term we are going to continue to be successful across the broad range of companies that we want to acquire that includes interconnect as well as sensor companies.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sherri Scribner","Hi. Diana, I just wanted to bridge the full-year revenue guidance versus what you\u2019ve said a couple of months ago to what you\u2019re saying now. It looks like you add the acquisition back. You add the modest beat that you had this quarter and then you take out the FX impact. It\u2019s mostly the same guidance. I just want to make sure that I\u2019m understanding that correctly. It seems like mostly the change is the acquisition and FX impact.","Diana Reardon","Sure. I think that\u2019s the right way to look at it. I think at the high end, that\u2019s exactly right. It\u2019s the same guidance adjusted for FX impact and adding in the Invotec acquisition. And from a low end of guidance, we\u2019ve increased the range from 2% to 5% organic growth to 3% to 5%. So I think the way you\u2019ve described is correct.","Sherri Scribner","Okay. Thanks. And then I guess just for the second quarter guidance, it seems a little \u2013 it seems like the seasonality is a bit less than you would typically see. Usually you see sales increased sort of in the mid-single-digit. On a sequential basis, what\u2019s really driving that? And then I guess, what\u2019s the strengths that drives growth in the second half of the year? Obviously, mobile devices to some extent, I just want to get a little more color. Thanks.","Diana Reardon","Sure. I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect in the second quarter to look sequentially. We expect not to see the normal sequential increase in the wireless market. The wireless network market, due to the fact that we now see a year-over-year decline in that market and I think Adam just described pretty well what is going on there.","In terms of the mobile device market, we actually do have a more positive view of that market and expect now that that market will be up in the mid-single-digit \u2013 range for the year. But in the second quarter, due to program timing, again we expect that market to be flat. And then as we move into Q3 and Q4, the second half of the year, we expect to see a significant strengthening in that market.","And that\u2019s why you see a little bit less than what our normal sequential seasonality would be in Q2 and we\u2019ll have a little bit higher than normal seasonality if you will when we move into Q3 in the second half of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Shawn Harrison","Hi. Good afternoon. I guess, kind of going back to the first question on mobile twofold on devices, am I correct, is it solely content gains which give you the bullish view on the second half of the year versus a better volume outlook for the device market? And then, second on networks, is it \u2013 is there an inventory issue of Amphenol products or is it that there\u2019s an inventory issue of end products being put into the market? I just wanted to be clear on that versus just lack of deployment of base stations and associated equipment for the year.","Adam Norwitt","Shawn, thank you very much. Just relative to mobile devices, it\u2019s hard for us to always say is it content gains? Is it new wins on new programs? Is it more content on programs that we already had content?

It seems as if private market multiples on sensor companies has gone a bit sky high over the past six to 12 months, is that anyway change your thinking about the opportunities in that market near-term knowing that you guys are typically a very stood acquirer?","Adam Norwitt","Well, I appreciate the complement. Look, we are not a bottom feeder. We are a stood acquirer. We paid fair multiples for good companies and we have bought many companies and many different valuation cycles. So, whether there are a few data points over the last 12 months that reflect maybe higher multiples than we would necessarily have paid because that changed the landscape for Amphenol, absolutely not.","We continue to have a fabulous reputation amongst sellers, both financial sponsor sellers as well as real owner, owner, managers of companies, as a company that does what it says, keeps its word, executes quickly, pays a fair price, and is a fabulous home ultimately for those companies.

Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Amit Daryanani","Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. Two questions from me, one, Adam, I was wondering if you can just touch on this mobile devices trend that you expect in the back half of, is there a lot of breadth to the strength that you guys are expecting or is it really driven by one or two customers because this is historically at least being a fairly volatile part and for you guys in the past. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how good the breadth is from a customer basis on the back half.","Adam Norwitt","Well, look, I think we\u2019ve always said and I wouldn\u2019t say anything different this year that our breadth in that market is relatively reflective of the overall breadth of who is successful and who\u2019s not successful in the space. And so, I think, I wouldn\u2019t say anything different about our outlook for this year. It is a market where there are always winners and losers of the day. And sometimes those are different winners and different losers of yesterday and different winners and different losers of tomorrow. But it is a relatively concentrated market as it relates to who\u2019s winning at a given moment. And I think from that standpoint, our guidance is consistent with how we have always approached that market.","I think we have a strong position across a lot of different products, product types as well. I mean, it\u2019s not just phones, it\u2019s not just tablets, it\u2019s not just ultrabooks, I mean, there\u2019s accessories and other things that go along with those. And I think our team has just done a fabulous job on their continued mission to diversify our presence in that space, as best one can in the space where there are always winners and losers.","Amit Daryanani","Got it. And then just on the automotive side, your revenue growth, the organic trends have been well ahead of what I think order production in content number would suggest. So, if we could just talk a little bit of what\u2019s driving that? And then, are you starting to get benefits from cross-selling opportunities with the GE sensor assets you guys acquired? Is that something tangible difference in your revenue line over there?","Adam Norwitt","Yes it\u2019s a very great point. I mean, we\u2019re just so proud of this market and how that\u2019s performed. I mean, just to think over the last, half a decade here. I mean six years ago, Q1 of 2009, this market was 5%, 6% of sales and here it is this quarter, 18% of sales. Really, a historical high for us across that balanced diversification that we have.","And I think if I look at why we continue to outperform, I mentioned in my remarks earlier, that we really see two main pillars of that. One is we\u2019ve made a lot of great acquisitions. And over the course of the last five years, we\u2019ve acquired just a great range of really interesting, really high technology, high performance companies ranging from companies that are involved in field connectors to companies involved in automotive lighting to companies involved in data com and power connectivity in the car to sensor companies.","And I think that those acquisitions have really rounded out our high value product offering, at the same time as the other pillar has been a real focus on organic growth and driving products into new applications in the car, not trying to take share from the traditional players but really capitalizing on new applications, new electronics, new functionalities that comes into the car. And so ultimately, as it gets to that sort of cross-selling, automotive is not a market where things slip on a dime. At the same time, if I think over the last five years, have we benefited from cross-selling of some of those acquisitions that we have brought on and have those become drivers of really renewed organic growth for the company? No question about it. But that does take time.","And so, now to your question of does the sensor company which we acquired 16 months ago in the case of Advanced Sensors or Casco, roughly less than half a year ago, have those started to create meaningful material impacts to sales? I wouldn\u2019t say that they\u2019re material impacts to sales, when I say that we have seen meaningful progress in finding those opportunities, absolutely. When do those ultimately translate into kind of moving the needle on a revenue standpoint? There is a certain time horizon to that in the automotive industry, whatever that may be, once in three years.","And I fully expect given the great progress that our team has managed to achieve, that we will see that impact long-term. But I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that our results this quarter have any meaningful impact from cross-selling of sensors, but they clearly have meaningful impact from cross-selling of other things that we\u2019ve acquired over the last six years.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open.","Mark Delaney","Great. Good afternoon and thanks so much for taking my questions.","Adam Norwitt","Thank you.","Mark Delaney","For the first question, Adam, I was hoping you could help provide some perspective on some of the trends you\u2019re seeing in the industrial end market and I know you commented on weakness in the oil and gas area specifically as you had anticipated, but I wanted to see if you\u2019ve seen slowdown in any of your other industrial end markets given some of the weaker data points we\u2019ve seen this earnings season from some of the big industrial companies.","Adam Norwitt","Sure. Well thank you very much. Obviously, we did talk about oil and gas and I think that\u2019s the real sort of the industrial market, the one that\u2019s no doubt in the headlines with the broadly reported price of oil and the resulting slowdown in some of the drilling, and extraction and the exploration activities there. And like anybody else, we\u2019re not immune to that slowdown and that had certainly had some impact.","I mean fortunately for us, we\u2019re not leveraged on to one or another part of the industrial market. We have a very diversified industrial market across things like heavy equipment, alternative energy, lighting, machine tool, factory automation, rail mass transit. And I think I mentioned where we saw really the strength in the quarter. We saw that great strength in heavy equipment and that heavy equipment strength was not just because of some acquisition that we made with Goldstar, but also we saw outstanding performance in heavy equipment organically where we\u2019ve just made great progress really in taking stronger position with customers in the off-road and heavy equipment market.","We\u2019ve seen fantastic performance in alternative energy where our team there has just done such a fabulous job in what is not an easy market. I mean, solar and wind energy and the other sort of ancillary alternative energies. Some of those can be very tough markets, but we have an organization that just focuses on that space, drives costs down, and takes share with important customers around the world. And they\u2019ve done a great job. We\u2019ve done a great job in things like lighting and machine tool, as well.","I think the only space where we maybe saw a little bit of downturn besides oil and gas, wasn\u2019t quite as robust in factory automation although in local currencies, it was relatively flat. But otherwise, I think we\u2019ve seen pretty broad-based growth in our industrial market.","Mark Delaney","Yes. Thanks. I appreciate the perspective there. And for a follow-up question on gross margins, I know gross margins have gone back to 32% which is a good number and I think that\u2019s been a level that are high after several years. I think the last time you guys were there were at 2010, 2011. As you look out into the second half of the year, if we think about mobile device revenue mix maybe increasing, is that something that\u2019s going to put some downward pressure on gross margin or are there other things that can maybe offset what I would expect would maybe be some mix headwinds for 2H?","Diana Reardon","I think that we would more talk about operating income margin. I think as we\u2019ve said before on prior calls, we really don\u2019t manage the gross margin or the SG&A line. We look at operating income margin and I think that they are within the market we participate in they are certainly to your point, a different mix of gross margin and SG&A, but it\u2019s the operating income, I think, that we all care about at the end of the day.","From an operating income standpoint, we had certainly very good performance here in the first quarter in line with what our expectations are. We had a very strong year-over-year conversion margin on incremental sales. I think the guidance as we\u2019ve laid that out has again good conversion margins in the remainder of the year. It implies an increase in ROS levels as we go through the year, and so, we feel very good about what the trajectory of that profitability will be during 2015 and that fully incorporates that mix that you refer to with a stronger mobile device market in the second half.","So again, we feel very good about the profitability profile that we expect to see in 2015 and expansion in ROS levels.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Amitabh Passi of UBS. Your line is open.","Amitabh Passi","Hi, guys. Adam, I have a couple of questions on the IT data com segment. Looks like sales are sort of stabilizing over the last three quarters or so, just wondering, are you starting to see somewhat stability with your OEM customers or do you continue to see your business skew more towards the web-scale companies?","Adam Norwitt","Yes, thank you very much, Amitabh. I think stabilized, we\u2019re happy to see actually pretty strong growth in that space this quarter. We grew 7% for the year. I think I guided that we expect to have that IT data com grow mid-single digits for the year and I think we\u2019re doing that at a time when you continue to not see such robust growth at least coming out of the publicly traded hardware OEMs around the world. So I think from that standpoint, we are \u2013 really continue to gain position in the IT data com space. There is no question that we have really expanded our activities around working with, as you call it, the web-scale providers or we call it kind of the data center web service provider customer base.","And I think that\u2019s a real pivot that we have had to make and in typical Amphenol fashion, that\u2019s a pivot that we make very quickly because that\u2019s kind of one of the great advantages of our entrepreneurial organization is that agility that we\u2019re able to exercise. We don\u2019t have to kind of completely restructure ourselves to pivot towards a new trend in that market. And I think as I mentioned earlier, we do see in the IT datacom market, quite a significant transformation happening and I think I call it kind of a re-architecting almost of how you work in that IT datacom space, and I just think our team has done a fantastic job in capitalizing upon that, not just reacting to it, but really capitalizing upon that change.","I think where we have seen real progress is in our real leading offering of high speed products, as well as with our outstanding power solutions that go into that market, and the high speed, no doubt about it, is such a critical feature. Whether you are a traditional OEM, a traditional enterprise data center or a web service provider, the amount of data that people are trying to crank through their systems and really pump out is just increasing at phenomenal, phenomenal rates.","I mean I see it in my own TV. I had a technician in my house last night because I can barely watch Netflix right now because it\u2019s just stopping and starting all the time and it just shows me again the phenomenal potential and the growth that is coming, and here I am, I\u2019m watching Netflix at most an hour a week, and for that one hour, if it stops and starts, it really is frustrating. And there\u2019s real value that is created for the end customers and thereby for the operators and the equipment manufacturers by creating high speed solutions that ultimately can support a much better pipe of data.","And so I think from that standpoint, it\u2019s a question of really that pivoting towards the new reality of the market together with the continued investment of our leading high speed and power products that have positioned us for the growth that we\u2019ve seen this quarter and that we expect this year.","Amitabh Passi","That was helpful, Adam. And just a quick follow-up, there\u2019s some excitement in the market around standardizing 25-gig. Is that a meaningful needle mover for you guys, or in the grand scheme of things, would have been noise [ph] I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how big 25-gig could be potentially for your business.","Adam Norwitt","Yes. I mean, 25-gig is something we\u2019ve actually been developing, inhibiting for I don\u2019t know, feels like almost eight years now, that we\u2019ve been talking about creating and have created interconnect solutions to support 25-gig. The reality is, we\u2019re working on interconnect solutions just well beyond 25-gig. And one of the reasons for that is, that the interconnect sometimes outlast the silicon in these devices. I mean you can imagine an environment where boxes are being built and they want to change our cards in that box with the latest speed upgrade. But you got to still put it through the connectors that are residing, for example, in the backplane or the midplane of such a system.","And so, we have always pride ourselves on creating high speed solutions that gives headroom beyond where the customers want to go in today. And so, it\u2019s true that there\u2019s maybe a lot of more publicized talk about 25-gig. For us, we\u2019re talking about things like 56-gig and 100-gig and beyond right now because we need to think far in advance such that when our customers design our product into their core architecture, they\u2019ve got room to expand in the future.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Wood of Macquarie Group. Your line is open.","Mike Wood","Hi. Good afternoon. First question on order growth, can you just remind us \u2013 you were looking for that end market for the full year. I think you may have mentioned low double-digit previously. And with the growth rates in auto be primarily determined by product launches or is it really customer decisions with upgrading to a specific add-ons when they make the car purchase?","Adam Norwitt","Thank you very much, Mike. Yes. I think we have guided for that market to be growing in the low-double-digit. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve given specific number, but it\u2019s somewhere in the low-teens I would estimate organically\u2026","Diana Reardon","Organic. Yes.","Adam Norwitt","Yes, from organic. Obviously, we have much higher expectations because of the acquisitions that we made last year. I think we would see in a local currency basis growth sort of more in the kind of 25%, 30% range for the year. Relative to timing, you have a couple of dynamics in play. Certainly, we have good content on new platforms and many times you work for many years on a new system that\u2019s integrated into a new platform and that has a certain ramp cycle to it. But in addition to that, what we have started to see more of over the recent years is what I would call mid-cycle upgrades.","And those mid-cycle upgrades would be things like lighting and onboard electronics where the electronics industry is just moving in a much faster pace than the automotive industry has traditionally moved. And I think the auto companies have recognized that there are certain feature sets in the car that they can\u2019t wait five years for a platform upgrade to implement. I mean, you\u2019d see it even in any car you drive, you buy it with a GPS system and within six months, that GPS already feels kind of old and clergy [ph]. And I think that that is the dynamic that the car companies they\u2019re really facing up too quickly. And so we have seen a few more of what I would call mid-platform upgrades which don\u2019t coincide with that traditional kind of second half of the year product launch that you would normally see in car companies. And so I think that it\u2019s maybe not quite as magnified to those platform launches as it has been traditionally.","Mike Wood","Great, and then more than 30% conversion in March on the interconnect business, was that upside relative to your long-term goals from the improvement on the acquired companies notably Advanced Sensors. So does that have a similar impact embedded in our 2Q guidance?","Diana Reardon","Sure. I think from a year-over-year standpoint, that\u2019s 32% conversion margin had contributions from both of those things. So I think to your point the acquisition program did come along very well during 2014 as we talked about last year and coming into this year, so there is a positive impact there. But the base business or the core business also performed very well from an operational and execution standpoint on that incremental volume. And so I think we\u2019re getting a contribution from both of those things that you\u2019re seeing in the Q1 profitability level.","And I would say as we work our way through 2015, I think, that would also be true where we expect both our base business and the acquired companies to continue to execute well and to continue to move up that scale from a profitability perspective.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is open.","Steven Fox","Thanks. Good afternoon. Two questions from me, one, just a quick check on your DSOs being up four days for the quarter. I wasn\u2019t quite clear on whether you were saying that there\u2019s a slightly higher level or whether you think that number comes down in the next couple of quarters. And then secondly, Adam, can you just talk a little bit more about the broadband business given it\u2019s never been a huge growth area for you organically and some of the things you just talked about seem to suggest that it could be headed for some more muted growth for a while and you have fixed costs that are, my understanding is very well associated just with that business. What is it that that keeps you in it today versus maybe looking out a year or two?","Diana Reardon","Maybe I\u2019ll just start with the DSO question.","Steven Fox","Yes. Thank you.","Diana Reardon","To your point and as I said, the DSO was at the high end of our normal range at the end of Q1 and DSO and payable days are a little bit harder because you can get the end of the quarter sometimes and if you do have a day or two either way. But I think that over time, we would expect, I think, that to come back down more to the midpoint of our range and it can range anywhere from 70 days to 77 days probably at the end of a quarter. But we would expect that that would work its way back down towards that midpoint.","Adam Norwitt","Yes. And, Steve, relative to the broadband business, it\u2019s true that right now we would certainly prefer to have them more robust growth outlook for the business, and last year that business was slightly down on a year-over-year basis.","Why are we in that business? And I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll just reiterate it today, we believe that it\u2019s very important for the company to participate in all aspects of the electronics industry and that includes in all aspects of how people get Internet and high speed data. And the broadband remains one of the top ways that high speed data is delivered to homes and businesses around this country and many others.","And we have just an outstanding position in that space, and I think our team has done an excellent job to diversify our products such that we\u2019re no longer simply just a cable on a real company that we were many years ago. It\u2019s very true that right now that industry is going through a lot of change. I mean, you have the very widely reported mergers that are still lingering and delayed. Then who knows ultimately whether they get approved. You can imagine that that causes a pause in the purchasing activities of customers.","But we saw a very similar dynamic for close to three years in our wireless networks business, and I talked all along about the fact that there was building, a pent-up demand in the wireless networks market, and ultimately, that pent-up demand which we continue to focus on gaining position, we continue to position on gaining technology breadth in that space, ultimately, last year, we were able to realize fantastic growth in that space as the operators ultimately realized that they had to satisfy some of that pent-up demand.","What kind of pent-up demand is being created in the broadband space? I mean I can only speak out of personal anecdotes of how terrible that service is in certain areas and you can imagine that as that business shakes out, in particularly in the United States, that one could imagine a scenario where the build-out activity strengthens again. And we\u2019re not a company that is just living by the short-term of what\u2019s happening in that market in a given year. We have long-term conviction that it\u2019s great to be in a space where we have a high technology, leadership position in an area that is delivering one of the best delivery systems for high speed data that anyone knows today.","So what will it be this year? We have a more muted expectation. We anticipate a little bit of growth this year. What will it end up being next year? Time will tell. But one day, will there be a necessity for investment in that space, an investment where Amphenol will be a participant in that? We certainly have that long-term conviction.","Steven Fox","Fair enough. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks.","Adam Norwitt","Thank you, Steve. I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes. Thank you. Adam, question on the sensors business. If you think through the strategy there, can you give a little context in terms of how much is push versus pull in terms of some of your customers perhaps pulling you into discussions in terms of what you can offer at this point and what the implications are for the growth there?","Adam Norwitt","Sure. I mean, look, I \u2018m not going to tell you that in any of our businesses, customers just come screaming and knock down the door. I mean, we got people out there knocking lots of doors. And so, in every one of our business, we\u2019re going to push hard and that\u2019s true certainly in the sensor business, as well.","I think to the extent that there is a pull, it\u2019s a pull that happened internally in Amphenol, where we have fabulous relationships with certain customers in certain segments of either the industrial or the automotive market in particular where we don\u2019t have a sensor relationship. And through that wonderful dialogue that we have with our ongoing relationship from an interconnect standpoint, we pull in the sensor team to talk about a collaborative drive whether that is a new integrated product, or whether that is just a totally new product that the customers says, hey, now that you have that sensor, let\u2019s talk. What\u2019s the genesis of that conversation? Is that the customer taking up to notice there is it our sales person promoting it or our engineering team promoting it, I have a hard time to say which is push and which is pull. But no question there\u2019s a lot of dialogue happening at customers across those spaces.","And the customers that I have had the good fortune to visit, they just are really happy that a company in whom they have so much confidence like Amphenol, now can offer them a broader solution of interconnect, of sensors and of antennas, which are all products that are real growth areas for customers in most of those spaces.","You talked about something like the Internet of Things which is a very often bantered about, almost clich\u00e9 these days. Ultimately, this Internet of Things as it\u2019s reflected in places like industrial and automotive and otherwise, is a network of sensors with antennas and interconnect on them. And there\u2019s very few companies very, very few who can say they\u2019re really a leader in all three spaces and that\u2019s something that we can say very strongly to our customers around the world. And I think ultimately that will create long-term value for the company and for those customers. And does it start with a push or a pull, it doesn\u2019t really matters as much as in the end that we win it.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. Maybe just a follow-up there since you mentioned kind of integrated product. Can you talk about just the design engineer teams working together now and how you envision that as you look out over a couple of years in terms of where the technology might go?","Adam Norwitt","Sure. I mean, you know very well, Craig, having covered the company for awhile that we have still a very simple organization which general managers who run their organizations and they have full accountability and authority to run their businesses and all the functions report up into those businesses. And so, we don\u2019t have an integrated engineering organization across Amphenol. What we do have is a very successful approach towards collaborating across those companies.","And so, to the extent that these integrated products happen, it\u2019s through that collaboration that will come, for example, between an engineer working in our sensor organization and an engineer working in one of the other operations, be that in industrial or automotive or otherwise. And the real question comes is how do you stimulate those dialogues and identify them. And that\u2019s where our group executives and our management team comes into play so much, which is making sure that we are incubating those dialogues on a frequent basis, facilitating them and identifying them as appropriate such that we can put those engineers in a room together and get the job done. And I think we\u2019ve done that really from day one.","So one of the very first things we did when we acquired Advanced Sensors and then later when we acquired Casco, was to get a bunch of engineers in a room together to meet each other, number one, and to exchange kind of, hey, this is what I do, tell me what you do, kind of you show me yours, I show you mine. And that initiation of the relationship was something that we took the opportunity very early to do and that has already started to pay great dividends through some of the collaborative activities that we\u2019ve seen.","So I think that long term, to the extent that customers have a desire and a need for those integrated products and we think they will and we see them already having that, I think our engineering teams will work very well collaboratively still within the basic Amphenol operating structure but in a way that can be very effective to solve those problems for customers.","Operator","Okay. Next question comes from the line of Will Stein of SunTrust. Your line is open.","Will Stein","Thank you for taking my question. Two quick ones, first in the wireless infrastructure end market, I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re seeing anything meaningful from the small cells this year?","Adam Norwitt","Yes. I think we are very much participating in small cells, and I couldn\u2019t break down how much of our sales are resulting from small cells, but is there something meaningful? Yes. I would say that there is something meaningful in small cells as the capital spending of some of our operator customers, in particular, shifts a bit from macro towards a bit \u2013 towards small and microcells. But we certainly would benefit from that because we have a great product offering that covers that both from an interconnect, as well as an antenna perspective.","Will Stein","Great. And then, in the industrial, that broad based industrial end market, I want to follow up on a question that\u2019s asked earlier. Often I think we as analysts try to look at results of some of the biggest industrial companies and try to draw conclusions from their results to those of Amphenol and others. And I\u2019m wondering if that \u2013 if you think that\u2019s a reasonable way for us to anticipate demand shifts in this end market or, perhaps, is much of your demand really coming from either private companies or companies that we might not have a good view of because of their size? Any characterization trying to line up those two, let\u2019s say, the results of the big companies and your results would be really helpful. Thank you.","Adam Norwitt","Sure. Will, I would love to be able to help you make a model for the industrial market, but I think I would fail miserably. You\u2019d do a much better job than I would. Our industrial business is so diversified. And so to look at maybe, for example, a diversified industrial company, I mean, there\u2019s a pretty big one down the road here in Connecticut and say, is that a proper proxy for the industrial outlook for Amphenol. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that that would be the most highly effective approach to that.","And we work across so many segments of industrial. Ultimately, what ties these industrial markets together is that their applications that tend to go into areas which are a little bit dirtier, a little bit more tricky to deal with, they tend to have to last a long time. But I mean, you\u2019re talking about applications as diverse as solar cells and high-speed rail, factory automation, oil and gas, things that may \u2013 companies that make earthmovers and tractors, lighting and next-generation lighting, medical. I mean, do those have necessarily the same cadence to them, those spaces, or is there one or two sort of proxy big companies where one can say, well, that\u2019s going to drive it, not necessarily.","And I think there\u2019s another element, too, which is the same dynamic that we talked about in automotive which is the expansion of new electronic feature set in that space. Means that you can\u2019t just say how many more cars are built this year and that\u2019s what are the revenues of Amphenol or Amphenol\u2019s peers going to be in that space. You have the very same dynamic that happens in industrial.","There is this what I \u2013 so, not is a very easy to say word but kind of an electronification that\u2019s happening across the industrial market and all those spaces that I referred to, where something, for example, that used to be a hydraulic or a mechanically driven feature on a tractor now becomes electronic, or where a train that used to only need power to connect between the cars now need the whole suite of fiber optics, and digital, and power, and RF and other aspects, or where a train network now has to be tracked through the whole wireless system, something like a positive train control. I mean I can go on and on about that migration that\u2019s happening in the industrial market away from hydraulics and mechanics and towards electronics, which is the same thing we\u2019ve seen in commercial areas, the same thing we\u2019ve seen in military, it\u2019s the same thing we\u2019ve seen in automotive whereby it\u2019s very hard to just take the overall equipment sales and then put that as a template for what one should expect for Amphenol.","I think clearly, our performance over these years has reflected a very different trajectory than one would have seen in overall GDP year overall industrial performance.","Will Stein","Great. Thank you.","Adam Norwitt","Thank you very much Will.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes. Thank you. Diana, you noted that inventory was a little higher than normal to support future builds. So in light of the fact that guidance is roughly flat sequentially, what end market is this targeting, why is it typically higher this quarter? And I have a follow-up.","Diana Reardon","Sure. I think we wouldn\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not going to get into inventory by end market, but I think our guidance is, from an organic standpoint, about 3% growth sequentially so it\u2019s not exactly flat but I think that some of this build is not necessarily just for Q2, but also to some extent, goes into the second half of next year. That being said, I mean, inventory is a little bit higher but it\u2019s still at the high end of the normal range that the company has had if you go back over the last few years. So, it\u2019s not an astronomical build in inventory that we\u2019re talking about here.","And I think as I\u2019ve said in the prepared remarks, we would expect as we go through the year, that inventory would come back down at least to the midpoint of the range from a day\u2019s perspective historically.","Wamsi Mohan","Okay. Thanks for that Diana. And then, if I\u2019m looking at this right, your guidance implies some organic deceleration in the second quarter, reacceleration again on the second half, despite some slightly tougher compares in the back half. So, is it fair to think that the puts and takes are largely the mobile network comments you alluded to in 2Q and then the mobile device ramp in 3Q that\u2019s creating this dynamic, or are there additional drivers of acceleration that you have confidence in 3Q and further","Diana Reardon","Sure. I think if you look at the guidance and think about why it\u2019s different than perhaps what you\u2019d expect from a normal seasonality standpoint, I think it\u2019s exactly those two markets that you just mentioned. It\u2019s the fact that the wireless markets, which would ordinarily be up sequentially in Q2 for the reasons I already explained. We don\u2019t expect that and then we do expect a pretty significant sequential uptick in the mobile device market in the second half of the year.","And that does happen from time to time. If you go back historically, you can find other years where that\u2019s happened. Then I think as Adam has described on many of these calls before, it just tends to be a lumpy type of business depending on timing of program introductions and that kind of things. But it is \u2013 those two markets that are giving the 2015 sequential seasonality a bit different look than perhaps what it has been in the past.","Operator","Okay. At this time, there are no further questions on queue. Speakers, you may proceed.","Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much. And again I thank you all for your attention today and I hope that spring has come as it has here at Wallingford, Connecticut, to all of you and we look forward to speaking to you again in a short three months. Thank you very much.","Diana Reardon","Thank you.","Adam Norwitt","Bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you for attending today\u2019s conference. And have a nice day."],"2245":["Amphenol Corp.

Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.","Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2018 conference call. Our first quarter 2018 results were released this good morning and I'll provide you some financial commentary on the quarter and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends. Then we will take questions.","As a reminder, we may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information.","The company closed the first quarter with sales of $1.867 billion and with GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.84 and $0.83, respectively, exceeding the high end of the company's guidance for sales by approximately $47 million and adjusted diluted EPS by $0.03. Sales were up 20% in U.S. dollars and up 16% in local currency as compared to the first quarter of 2017. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the first quarter increased a very strong 12%. Sequentially, sales were down 4% in U.S. dollars, 5% in local currency and 6% organically.","Breaking down sales into our two segments, our Cable business, which comprised 5% of our sales, was flat compared to the first quarter of last year. The Interconnect business, which comprised 95% of our sales, was up 21% in U.S. dollars from last year driven primarily by organic growth as well as the impact of acquisitions. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.","Operating income was $377 million for the first quarter and operating margin was a strong 20.2% in the first quarter of 2018, up 10 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2017 of 20.1% and down 30 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 of 20.5%. From a segment standpoint, in the Cable segment, margins were 11.7%, which is down compared to the first quarter of 2017 at 14.2% primarily driven by an increase in certain commodity costs.","In the Interconnect segment, margins were a strong 22.1% in the first quarter of 2018, which is flat compared to the first quarter of last year. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high performance action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a dynamic market environment. Due to careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies to both existing and acquired companies, our management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance in the future.","Interest expense for the quarter was $25 million compared to $19 million last year, reflecting the impact of higher average interest rates as well as higher average debt levels primarily resulting from the company's stock buyback program. The company's adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 25.5% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 26.5% in the first quarter of 2017. The adjusted effective tax rate in both periods excludes the excess tax benefit associated with the stock option exercises as we discussed during last quarter's earnings call.","The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018, including the excess tax benefit associated with the stock option exercises, was approximately 24.4% compared to 23.8% in the first quarter of 2017.","Adjusted net income was a strong 14% of sales in the first quarter of 2018 and on a GAAP basis, diluted EPS grew 18% in first quarter of 2018 to $0.84 from $0.71 in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes the excess tax benefit from stock option exercises in both periods, grew 20% to $0.83 in the first quarter of 2018 from $0.69 in the first quarter of 2017.","Orders for the quarter were a new record $2.17 billion, a 26% increase over the first quarter of 2017, resulting in a very strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.08:1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $130 million in the first quarter, which included a payment of approximately $81 million to fully fund our U.S. pension plan. Excluding this payment, cash flow from operations was $211 million or approximately 80% of net income.","From a working capital standpoint, inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were approximately $1.2 billion, $1.5 billion and $798 million respectively at the end of March. And inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days, excluding the impact of acquisitions, were 84, 74 and 57 days respectively, which were up slightly from 12\/31 of 2017, but all within our normal range.","The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income and we expect a typically strong cash flow for the full year of 2018. At March 31st, cash and short-term investments were approximately $1 billion compared to $1.8 billion at December 31st of 2017. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was primarily driven by the company's use of cash that was enabled by the repatriation of foreign cash, which began in the first quarter of 2018 under the new Tax Act.","The vast majority of the company's current cash balance is held outside the U.S. and we expect to continue repatriating additional cash throughout 2018. The company will continue to assess opportunities to deploy its capital consistent with our overall capital allocation strategy. We believe that the ability to freely move earnings under the new territorial system will provide additional support for the company's long-term capital allocation strategy, which focuses on achieving a balance between organic business development, acquisition growth and shareholder returns, including dividend and share buybacks.","The cash flow from operations of $130 million, stock option proceeds of $21 million and cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $729 million were used primarily to purchase approximately $382 million of the company's stock, to repay $306 million under the commercial paper program, to fund acquisitions of $100 million, to fund dividend payments of $58 million and to fund net capital expenditures of $54 million. During the quarter, the company repurchased 4.2 million shares of stock at an average price of $90, bringing total repurchase under the plan since its inception in January of 2017 to approximately 12.6 million shares.","This quarter's repurchases completed are $1 billion open-market stock repurchase plan, and as mentioned in today's earnings release, the company's board of directors has approved a new three-year open-market repurchase plan for the purchase of up to $2 billion of the company's common stock as well as a 21% increase in the quarterly dividend on the company's common stock from $0.19 to $0.23 per share. This increase brings our dividend yield back to approximately 1% and is effective for payments beginning in July.","At the end of the quarter, the company had issued approximately $870 million under its commercial paper program and the company's cash and availability under our credit facility totaled approximately $2.2 billion. Total debt at March 31st was approximately $3.2 billion and net debt is approximately $2.2 billion. The first quarter 2018 EBITDA was approximately $449 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter.","I will now turn it over to Adam, who will provide an overview of the business and comment on current trends.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Well, thank you very much, Craig and welcome to all of you to our first quarter earnings call. Pleasure to have you all here.","As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the quarter. I'll then go into a discussion on the trends as well as our progress across our diversified served markets. Then finally I'll make a few comments on our outlook for the second quarter and full year and, of course, we'll reserve time at the end for questions.","Now with respect to the first quarter, I can just say that we're very pleased with the company's extremely strong start to 2018 as we're today reporting results that were stronger than we had expected, with both sales and earnings exceeding the high end of our guidance. Revenues in the quarter increased by a very strong 20% in U.S. dollars and 12% organically, reaching $1.867 billion as Craig highlighted. And just want to highlight again that we booked record orders in the quarter, more than $2 billion, second quarter in a row, exceeding that $2 billion level. And those orders grew 26% from prior year and represented a very robust book-to-bill of 1.08:1.","Operating margins were again strong in the quarter reaching 20.2% and this again demonstrates the strength of the company's overall operating performance. Very pleased that our board of directors just yesterday approved two significant measures aimed at continuing our strong return of capital to shareholders with both the $2 billion three-year stock repurchase program as well as the 21% increase in the dividend that Craig detailed. Just want to say that with this excellent start to 2018, I'm once again extremely proud of the entire Amphenol global organization, a team of people whose agility and superior execution are clearly reflected in the company's strong results in the first quarter.","Now, getting to the trends in our served markets, and just want to reflect that here as we finish the first quarter, we remain very pleased with the breadth and balance of our exposure across these many markets in the electronics industry. And once again in the quarter, no market represented more than 20% of our sales. We continue to believe that that balance is a true asset for the company in any economic cycle in particular given the many dynamics that are always present in the electronics industry.","The military market in the quarter represented 10% of our sales. Sales increased from prior year by a better-than-expected 20% in U.S. dollars and a very strong 18% organically, as we once again drove growth across virtually every segment of the military market. Our performance in the quarter was strong as in ordnance, military, aviation, space, communications as well as vehicle applications. On a sequential basis, sales were stronger than expected rising 3% from the fourth quarter.","Just want to say I'm extremely proud of our team that's working in this important market, the military market. They've continued to expand our leading position by driving the development of high-technology interconnect solutions that are incorporated into the broadest array of military electronics. As the defense spending environment has improved, our ability to execute on the increased demand from our diverse range of customers has, once again, confirmed that these customers can rely upon Amphenol to deliver when they need us most. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the second quarter to remain at these robust levels. And for the full-year 2018, we now expect to achieve low-double-digit growth in the military market.","Turning to the commercial aerospace market, comm aero represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. And our performance strengthened in the first quarter with sales increasing by 14% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically. Sequentially, sales were a bit better than we had expected coming into the New Year with sales increasing by 3% from the fourth quarter. And as we look into the second quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these levels. And for the full-year 2018, we continue to expect a low-single-digit increase from prior year. We're very encouraged by the company's strong performance in commercial aerospace in the first quarter and remain confident that our strong overall position in the market will remain very robust.","We continue to broaden our range of products in support of the revolution of new electronics and next-generation airplanes and we look forward to capitalizing on our leading technologies for many years to come. The industrial market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew also by a very strong 27% in U.S. dollars and 14% organically, as we drove strong organic growth across essentially all segments of the industrial market and that included in particular hybrid bus and truck, oil and gas, heavy equipment, instrumentation as well as medical.","In addition, we're very pleased that we've realized significant benefits from several of our acquisitions that we've completed over the last year. Sequentially, sales in the industrial market were slightly down from the strong fourth quarter on normal seasonality. Looking into the second quarter, we expect sales to increase from these levels as we capitalize on our broad technological strength across the many various segments of the worldwide industrial market. And for the full-year 2018, we continue to expect sales growth in the mid-teens.","The diversified industrial market remains a great strength for Amphenol. The combination of our broad array of interconnect, antenna and sensor products, our access to and support of a very broad range of segments, as well as the company's geographical reach, have all positioned Amphenol strongly for the future in the industrial market. And as electronics continue to transform industrial applications, we look forward to realizing the benefits of our excellent position in this important market.","The automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. As we had expected coming into the quarter our sales again grew strongly in the automotive market, growing by 26% in U.S. dollars, 17% in local currencies, and 10% organically. Importantly, we did grow again in double-digits in all three of the major geographical regions: North America, Asia and Europe. Sequentially, our sales grew by 6% from the fourth quarter with the benefits from the Sunpool acquisition that we completed just at the end of December.","We remain excited by the company's excellent and growing position in the automotive market. Our continually expanding range of Interconnect Products, which include discrete connectors as well as complex interconnect assemblies, together with our broad range of automotive sensors and our strengthened position in automotive antennas, positions us to take advantage of the multitude of opportunities to enable new electronics in cars.","Whether in traditional fuel-powered hybrid or electric vehicles, carmakers are integrating advanced electronics into virtually every function in the automobile. And this creates an outstanding long-term growth opportunity for the company. Looking into the second quarter, we expect sales to grow moderately from these levels. And for the full-year 2018, we continue to expect sales growth in the high-teens.","The mobile devices market represented 14% of our sales in the quarter, and our sales, once again, grew very strongly from prior year, rising by an outstanding 68% from first quarter 2017 levels, as significantly stronger sales of products used in smartphones as well as production-related products were partially offset by softness in tablets. As we had expected coming into the quarter, our sales were down from the fourth quarter by 25% sequentially due to the typical seasonality that we see at the beginning of the year. I would just note that this was roughly the same sequential decline that we experienced last year.","Our performance over the last several quarters has truly reconfirmed the extraordinary abilities of our team working in the always dynamic mobile devices market. The reactivity and meeting the challenging and ever-changing demands from customers, all while continuing to develop innovative, next-generation products and manufacturing processes, has secured our leading position in this important market.","Looking ahead, we expect sales in the second quarter to reduce from these levels as volumes moderate for several new product ramps. Nevertheless, given our position on a number of new programs to be launched later this year, and, of course, understanding, as always, that the mobile devices market is inherently difficult to predict, we now expect sales to increase in the mid- to high-single-digits for the full year 2018, and that compares to our previous outlook of low-single-digit growth. We're encouraged by the strengthened outlook in the mobile devices market, and we look forward to realizing continued benefits from our strong position for many years to come.","The mobile networks market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter, and our sales were a bit better than expected, rising by 2% from both prior year and prior quarter. Growth in our sales with service providers more than offset a moderation of demand from OEMs. Given that somewhat stronger performance in the quarter, we now expect to achieve low-single-digit growth for the full-year 2018 in the mobile networks market. And looking into the second quarter, we expect a mid-single-digit sales increase from Q1 levels.","I will say that while we're encouraged by our strengthened outlook in the mobile networks market, we don't believe that this yet marks a change in the overall outlook for carrier spending and does not yet reflect any meaningful benefits from prospective or future investments in 5G networks. Nevertheless, we continue to work on a wide range of next-generation systems with our customers around the world, and we are very encouraged by the strength of our position with both interconnect products and antennas for OEMs and operators. And we look forward to realizing the benefits from such strength for many years to come.","With the acceleration of video and data traffic through mobile networks, together with increasing demands for coverage, our company is well positioned to capitalize on whatever investments will be made in next-generation wireless networks in the future. The information technology and data communications market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter, and we are pleased that our performance was a bit better than expected in the first quarter with sales growing slightly from prior year and declining a less-than-expected 3% from the fourth quarter, a typically softer quarter in IT\/Datacom.","Our year-over-year growth in servers and storage systems was almost fully offset by reduction in sales of our products incorporated into networking equipment. We remain very confident in our strength in the exciting IT\/Datacom market, and the nucleus of the strength of that position is our industry-leading range of advanced technology, high-speed power and fiber optics products. These products are used in a wide array of equipment made by global OEMs as well as used in data centers of our web service provider customers. With the dramatic expansion of data traffic around the world, we look forward to realizing the benefits of that position for many years to come.","Looking into the second quarter, we expect sales to increase from these levels, and for the full-year 2018, we continue to expect low- to mid-single digit sales growth.","The broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter, and sales in this market reduced from prior year by 6% as cable operators continued to moderate their spending. On a sequential basis, sales rose slightly from the seasonally softer fourth quarter.","As we look into the second quarter, we expect a significant seasonal increase in our sales as broadband operators accelerated investments in their data and video delivery networks. And for the full-year 2018, we now expect a low-single digit increase in sales. We remain very pleased with our position in the broadband market, and we look forward to realizing the benefits of our expanded product offering in support of customers who are delivering data, video and voice to consumers and businesses around the world.","There's still the possibility of more consolidation in the broadband industry, and as you know, that always has the potential to create pauses in capital investment. But, nevertheless, we are encouraged by the modestly more positive environment that we see here in 2018. And we look forward to continuing to diversify and strengthen our product offering to this market for many years to come.","So, just in summary, I can just say that I'm extremely pleased with the company's strong start to the year here in 2018. And while the global market environment remains very dynamic, I'm just so proud that the Amphenol organization is executing extraordinarily well and expanding our market position, while strengthening the company's financial performance.","Amphenol's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across our diverse markets, our worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure, a highly effective acquisition program and most importantly, our agile, entrepreneurial management team.","Now, turning to our outlook for the second quarter and the full year, and assuming there are no significant changes to the current economic or geopolitical environment, and based as always on constant exchange rates, we now expect in the second quarter and full-year 2018 the following. For the second quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1.855 billion to $1.895 billion as well as adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.83 to $0.85. This represents a sales and adjusted diluted EPS increase versus prior year of 11% to 14% and 12% to 15%, respectively.","For the full year 2018, we now expect sales in the range of $7.630 billion to $7.750 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.49 to $3.55. And for the full year, this represents sales and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 9% to 11% and 12% to 14% over 2017 levels, respectively. On an organic basis, our new outlook now represents full year sales growth of 4% to 6%, which is an increase from our prior organic growth guidance of 2% to 4%.","We're very encouraged by the company's strong start to 2018 as well as our improved guidance. And I'm confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon this excellent start for the company by continuing to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position while also delivering strong financial performance in 2018 and beyond.","So with that, operator, it'd be our pleasure to take any questions that may be there.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess a question and a follow-up for me. To start with, I had one on the mobile device side. The uptick that you're talking about for the full year, it's really \u2013 I think it's all happening in the back half, September, December quarters. But this uptick is it more a reflection that you feel better about what unit numbers will do for your customer base? Or are you feeling more confident about the content you have per unit that's driving that uptick? Just between those two factors, what's driving it?","Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah. Well, thanks very much, Amit. I think you're correct in assuming that that is the back half, which is not surprising. If you look at our performance last year, I think we grew somewhere in the mid 90%, second half to first half. I don't think we have that same expectation this year. But as normal, we would expect that to be back half.","I think we are not making a prognosis here necessarily on unit volumes. Rather, I think what has given us the comfort to strengthen our outlook is just the strength of our position on the various programs in which we are participating. And whether that is content, whether that is allocation, it's just an overall sense of the strength of our position.","Last year was a fabulous year for us in mobile devices. We had come into the year, as you know very well, with a less sanguine outlook. And then over the course of the year, we were able to capitalize on some opportunities that really were there in support of several of our customers. And I think that everybody asked the question coming into this year, does that have some ability to perpetuate itself with those customers who are happy that you worked so closely and effectively with them. And I think our team's done a great job to confirm that we do, indeed, have a very strong position with a number of those customers. And that's what's reflected here in these numbers.","And again, I will always say relative to mobile devices that it is an inherently very challenging market to forecast, and we always try to give you our best view of what we see at the time of our earnings release. And we're pleased that at least at this point, we feel like we have a little bit of a stronger position than we did 90 days ago.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley, your line is now open. Please mute your line.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Want to focus, Adam, on just IT\/Datacom, if we look at some of the strengths in hyperscale, Google CapEx just this week, even traditional enterprise looking a bit better from a spend. So just wanted to get your thoughts, I know you're more focused on the hyperscale, but just overall in IT\/Datacom, how you're seeing that market today and as you go through the year?","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah. I think as I talked about in my prepared remarks, IT\/Datacom was modestly better performance in the first quarter for us than we had thought coming into the year. So we continue to feel like we have a fantastic position in IT\/Datacom. Our outlook for the second quarter is to grow from these levels, and our outlook for the full year is to have kind of mid-single-digit growth from prior year.","I think we've demonstrated over a number of years that our team, working in IT\/Datacom, has just done an outstanding job of really pivoting towards some of those opportunities that are encompassed in some of the names that you talked about, and more broadly than that, into the overall service provider market in IT\/Datacom while not losing sight of the importance of our work that we do with OEMs around the world.","And as we look at our program win rates with customers, as we look at our support of customers when they need us most, when they're ramping up, when they're building new data centers, when they're releasing new products, there's no question that our position in the IT\/Datacom market today is really stronger than it's ever been before. And so we look forward to more spending that will come. I think sitting where we sit today, I think the guidance that we've given is a strong guidance. And if there arise any opportunities to do better than that, you can bet we're going to be very well poised to do so.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Thank you, Craig.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes. Thanks and good afternoon, Craig and Adam. Just a question, Craig, on the margin, the operating margin, if you sort of back into the number based on midpoint of EPS and revenue, it looks like operating margin year-over-year will be flat to down slightly. I'm just trying to reconcile that. You've been growing margins modestly every quarter. Are there any kind of headwinds in terms of investments or commodity costs? I know you talked about some commodity headwinds in the Cable business.","Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.","Yes, thanks, Matt, appreciate the question. Actually obviously, we don't guide specifically to operating margins, but I would say actually, our guidance does have an assumption that there is actually going to be some expansion in the margin at some level year-over-year. And we were certainly very proud that achieving the 20.2% that we achieved in the first quarter.","As we have talked about before and you would certainly see a little bit in certainly the first quarter and even maybe the second quarter, a little bit results that would have had a little bit of a commodity headwind with regards to our Cable segment, which we certainly talked about, and I did talk about in my prepared remarks, in addition to some of the newly acquired companies that we acquired last year that are at a bit lower profitability levels that certainly are accretive from an EPS perspective, but certainly, aren't quite yet up to our operating margins from an overall company average perspective.","So, and we do expect over time to certainly get them to that level as they certainly adapt that operating discipline that we have hopes that they will do. So, but I'd say in the second quarter, we're certainly optimistic about their operating margins. And we do expect some expansion. And certainly, if you look at our full year guidance, we also have kind of a typical kind of conversion, long-term conversion, 25% target. And I would say for the full year, we're kind of in that range. That's obviously higher or lower in any one particular year. But over time, this is certainly a conversion that we would expect to be able to continue to achieve.","Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. One for Craig and one for Adam, if I could. Craig, as you look at this $2 billion in new repurchase authorization, I mean, your last one, you completed that, you had announced a two-year timeframe, you finished that in five quarters. How should we think about the cadence of share repurchases for this $2 billion? And the magnitude of that step-up \u2013 is that sort of just a reflection of the longer-term confidence? Or is it meant to signal any change in your longer-term M&A strategy? And I have a follow-up for Adam.","Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.","Sure. Thanks a lot, Wamsi. In regards to the program and the cadence, we're certainly very happy to be able to announce this $2 billion program. And it's a three-year program, which is a little bit longer of a program in terms of the term than we had historically done. But we thought certainly this was an appropriate time to increase the size of the program.","I think if you think about our share return or return of capital to shareholders, our strategy over time continues to be kind of returning our capital, about 50% of our free cash flow over time to our shareholders. And we certainly have been able to do that over time. And this really doesn't change that.","And in terms of cadence, I would say that it doesn't indicate that we're going to do that evenly or not. This buyback could be lumpy. It depends on a number of factors. It depends on other cash needs. It depends on M&A activity. It depends on certainly market price of the stock. It depends on a whole host of different factors that we consider when we're buying back stock. And certainly, we'll continue to consider those things.","But I think what you see over time is that we've been able to do all of what we do in terms of deployment of capital, which is a very balanced approach of returning capital to shareholders and performing our M&A activities. And we have been able to kind of balance all of that.","So whether or not that happens sooner than that three-year term, I certainly wouldn't say that at this point in time. But certainly we'll continue to look at the opportunities to buy back shares and ensure that our balanced and flexible approach around our deployment of our capital continues to be maintained as it has been over many years.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks, Craig. And, Adam, as a follow-up, how are you viewing your China exposure relative to some of the trade rhetoric risk? And how are you planning for any contingencies, if anything, at this point? Or do you think it's just too early at this point to take a longer-term view on that? Thank you.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Well, thanks very much, Wamsi. I mean, obviously, we are very sensitive and watching all of the news. And I can just tell you that as a global electronics company you can imagine that we are actively monitoring all of these policy dynamics. And beyond just monitoring it, we continue to lend our voice to those and many other companies who have a belief that ultimately free trade is a positive force for the world, not just for our global electronics industry. It's a good thing for our customers, for end consumers as well as for our employees and the other stakeholders in Amphenol.","And if I look at what has been talked about so far, at this point, we don't believe that any of the policies that have been announced would have any material negative financial impact on the company. But, more importantly, we remain very committed to ensuring that we and our customers around the world are not going to be negatively impacted by any potential changes. And the most important part of that is that we are prepared to react in our typical fast and flexible manner to whatever comes our way.","I mean, you know very well that the entrepreneurial culture that we have is actually uniquely suited to times like this where sometimes, you can't exactly predict what's going to come along. And we have this team of more than 100 general managers around the world, and they're always poised to react to any changes that are there. I mean, specific to China, I will tell you that we are in China, like we are in every other country, a very local participant in the market. And we are not a company that is staffed by a bunch of expats flying around the world. And while we may be a U.S.-headquartered company, our team in China is Chinese, and our team in India is Indian, and our team in Germany is German.","And so we are viewed by customers really as a local and trusted partner in helping to make their electronics equipment higher performing and ultimately, allowing them to send more. Of course, we will comply with whatever laws are put in place, and we will react to those in our typical manner. But at this point, I think it's a little too early to give a kind of prognosis about what will ultimately happen. It's a little bit all over the place, I would say. And so we're just going to stay agile, stay flexible and keep supporting our customers wherever they may be.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thank you. Just thinking about the full year guidance and the implications for the linearity for the year, it seems like if you look at the EPS guide, you guys beat by about $0.04 in the first quarter. The second quarter guide is about flat with the Street. It implies about a $0.05 increase in the back half of the year to EPS. But the sales guidance doesn't reflect all of that upside you saw in 1Q. Can you maybe give us some thoughts on what drives that linearity? And how much of the buyback is reflected in that $0.05 in the second half?","Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.","Sure, Sherri. Thanks. I'll take that. I'm not sure I'm quite getting into the same math, but we did beat by actually \u2013 on the high end, we beat by $0.03 on our almost $50 million beat on the high end. And then we raised, obviously, $150 million, and we raised, I guess, on the high end by about $0.08. So I think that that is pretty consistent with our typical conversion in terms of how we think about converting our revenue into ultimately the bottom line, and ultimately, EPS.","So I think that there isn't anything, I guess, special or something that would point out as being abnormal about that in regarding to our overall \u2013 and certainly, we're extremely happy to be able to and pleased to be able to raise our guidance and continue to convert very strongly on the bottom line. And I think it indicates, as I mentioned in my prior remarks, about very strong operating margins for the year any conversion. So anyway, so I think that certainly very happy with the results, and we do think it's kind of a typical beat on the high end in regards to its translation at the EPS level.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just quickly on the Mobile Devices segment, I think you guys had expected that to be down 20% sequentially, and it was down 25%. Can you maybe give us some details on the puts and takes on what drove that a little bit lower than your expectations? You guys have already commented on the full year. So I think I understand the full year. Thanks.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah, thanks very much, Sherri. I wouldn't comment on anything significant. I think maybe just overall volumes were a little bit lower than we had expected. But I think in a typical first quarter, like I said, last year, first quarter was also down 25%. We said we thought it would be approximately 20%. 25% was maybe slightly more than approximately 20%. But nothing material or meaningful was very different. So, I guess, at the end of the day, it was just a little bit lower volume, but nothing of note.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Hi, Adam and Craig, congrats on the results. Two questions, if I may...","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Thanks so much, Shawn.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Thanks. First, Adam, just on the defense business, the DOD budget went up I think after you guys guided for the year. And was wondering if you saw any of that benefit in the March quarter, if that increase would still be coming to you later as the year progresses?","And then second, Craig, just the $100 million on M&A in the quarter, I didn't see any deals that were announced. I was wondering if that was maybe just earn-outs or for prior deals?","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah. So let me first talk about the defense budget. It's true. As we released our earnings 90 days ago, there was still this hot debate on Capitol Hill about continuing resolutions and whether there would, in fact, be a permanent budget. And we were very pleased like everyone that there is, in fact, a budget that we can all kind of base our businesses upon, and which did include, as you correctly point out, an increase in the defense budget.","I think our performance in the first quarter; I don't know that that had any relation to the defense budget being passed. We did upgrade our outlook for the year. And whether that is related to the budget, it's related to what we hear from our customers. So we are not forecasting our defense business based on kind of macro trends. We forecast it based on what we hear from our customers. Now, are our customers spending more with us because they're getting more from at least in the case of the U.S., the U.S. Department of Defense, I think it's not crazy to think that that could be some relation to that.","So we've actually seen strong performance in our military business on a global basis and all those geographies where we can and do participate. And if you look at our performance, 18% organic growth in the quarter and outlook for the year to be in low double digits, I mean, this is just very, very strong performance and a confirmation of the depth and breadth of our position in the military market.","And so to the extent that there is more money being spent and to the extent that that more money is being spent on upgrades of systems, on new electronic systems, I think there's no doubt about it that we'll be there to participate in that, and look forward to it.","Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.","And as it relates to the acquisition payments on the cash flow, as you recall, we announced the CTI acquisition in our January guidance, which actually closed in January. So a large portion of that on the cash flow related to that acquisition, in addition to some deferred purchase payments on some acquisitions that closed in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks very much. A question for Adam, and then I have a question for Craig. Adam, when we think about the operating results of your company, they were very strong. But one has to also think about total company operating margins, about flattish year-over-year. But Cable Products were down year-over-year on revenues higher. Is that cost of goods sold a little bit higher? Or are you integrating some acquisitions or some timing? Or what's the real swing factors we should kind of list as far as operating margin impacts going forward?","And then, Craig, just to make sure for the stock buyback and dividend it sounds like \u2013 or maybe this is Adam also \u2013 maybe this is more of a don't put M&A on the hold, it's just the cash flows are strong enough to support continued M&A as well as stock buyback and dividends, is that correct?","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yes. Well, Jim, just very simply put, that's correct. We're not putting M&A on hold. To answer your second question, we always prioritize M&A as well as our organic investments, but the company is a fabulous generator of cash. And we believe that a balanced return of capital to shareholders, together with a prioritization of our M&A program, is the right way to manage our capital structure. And it's a very consistent approach that we have taken.","Relative to the operating results, and specifically Cable, I think Craig talked already about the fact that we have seen some pressure on commodities in our Cable business specifically. And that has resulted in the Cable margins being under pressure and down on a year-over-year basis. But even with that, to have the ROS still growing by 10 basis points year-over-year is a great confirmation of the performance in the Interconnect business in an environment that is inflationary.","There's no doubt about it. There are inflationary pressures, and I think our team has done just a phenomenal job to either drive that in pricing with customers or in redesigning of products or in somehow making sure that we don't suffer the impact on the interconnect side of some of those commodity price increases, which are very broad.","It's harder to do that in the Cable business, as you know, having the followed the company for so many years, because of the intensity of the consumption of commodities into that Cable combined with the nature of the market where it is a more constrained market and where pricing power is not always so evident.","We continue to be very disciplined in that space, and we will remain disciplined. And whenever there are opportunities for us to pass on the impact of these commodities, we will certainly do so in a very quick fashion. But at this stage, I think the overall operating results of the company are very strong. We have grown on a year-over-year. And as Craig said earlier, we have a good outlook for the continuation of that performance in 2018.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much for the details.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Thanks so much, Jim.","Operator","And our next question comes from William Stein of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thank you for taking my question. I'm wondering if you can comment, Adam, on your own lead times today, also customer inventories and the influence of any component shortages you're seeing. Basically sort of an update on supply chain conditions, please.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah, no, thank you very much, Will. I mean, there is obviously a lot written about component shortages and lead times and things like this, and I think most of that \u2013 those discussions revolve around passive components, things like capacitors and transistors and various chips and things like that. We have not seen in our company meaningful or broad-based changes in our lead times, and we have some businesses that are doing very, very well. And occasionally, when that happens, you'll see the odd lead time go slightly up. But I can just tell you we continue to satisfy truly the needs of our customers. We're not on allocations, nothing like that.","I mean, our team has done a fabulous job of flexing. I mean, just look at that business which is typically the least flexible, which is the military business where sometimes it does take you time to build capacity. And our team was able to grow on a year-over-year basis by 18% organically; just a very, very strong performance in a business where sometimes it is not as easy to flex in that way. And so I think our customers really continue to see with us a great supporter of their needs in that time of growing demand.","And accordingly, I wouldn't expect that customers are necessarily building up kind of safety inventory. Now, I'll caveat that to say that we don't have peer visibility into the warehouses of our customers, in particular OEM customers. We get a little bit of visibility to our distributors. But what we see with those customers or hear at least anecdotally, is not a real sort of structural buildup in their inventory, and part of that is because we have been able to really satisfy their demand with our operational flexibility.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Maybe one other if I can. Given the increase in rates that we've seen, I'm wondering if there's any change in the M&A environment or your pipeline?","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yes. I think we always, as you know, take a very long view in M&A. Whether markets are up or markets are down or rates are up or rates are down, that has not changed our strategic approach to M&A, whereby we cultivate a pipeline of companies, a very big pipeline of companies over a long time period where we remain poised when companies that we didn't know pop up in an instance. And we continue to have very strong pipeline of acquisitions. Yes, it's true. We didn't announce any new acquisitions this quarter, albeit having closed one early in the quarter that we talked about three months ago.","But we continue to have a very strong pipeline of acquisitions, and I think the company, Amphenol, remains just a wonderful destination for companies large and small who are considering one day having a change in their ownership. And I think the credibility of our track record, the hospitableness of the organizational structure that we have, whereby new companies can join Amphenol without that significant disruption that is sometimes accompanied with an acquisition, together with our willingness to pay fair prices for great companies.","And again, whatever the rate environment is or the market environment, market multiples, we look at this with a very, very long-term view towards M&A. And we're willing to pay reasonable and fair prices for very strong companies. And that discipline that we have had for many years has never resulted in us failing to have a strong acquisition program. And we don't think that that'll be the case, regardless of which way rates are headed.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is now open.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Yeah, thanks. Good afternoon. I was just curious. Obviously, your sales guidance calls for reasonable deceleration in organic sales growth. Some of the markets you participate in are cyclical. I guess I'm trying to gauge your confidence that we have sort of a soft landing in markets like auto, industrial maybe even commercial air versus prior cycles. Why do you think that could be the case outside of obviously your own content wins? Thanks.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah. No. I mean I don't know soft landing, I think it's a strong sales guidance. We've increased our organic guide for the year. As you know, we came into the year with a guide of 2% to 4% and now we've increased that to 4% to 6% organically.","And yes while we grew in this quarter on an organic basis by 12% that would mathematically imply that there is a little bit less growth in subsequent quarters. We should also recognize that mobile devices in this quarter grew 68% a very, very strong performance.","We don't expect that same year-over-year performance, especially as we get into the back half of the year where last year Q4 we also grew something like 67% in mobile devices. But regardless of that we still think that this year will be a strong year for mobile devices in its totality.","So I don't think if you were to take out for example that impact of the mobile devices which as you know has its certain volatility relative to what quarters are strong and what quarters are not strong, I think that you'd see a relatively balanced year; that is inherently implied in our outlook.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","That's helpful; and then just a quick follow-up. Can you guys give us a sense for your capital spending expectations for the full year roughly, maybe as a percent of the sales or dollars whatever you're comfortable with?","Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah. I mean as you know, our typical capital spending for the company is somewhere in the range of 2% to 4% that we talk about historically and we've been kind of averaging around that 3% level.","I think this year based on program ramps, there could be some slight increase over the 3% level. But I would still expect to be in the range of the 2% to 4% give or take this year, so really no significant change versus over the last 2 years and certainly no difference in terms of trends going forward.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","So I think as Craig said I mean we may see maybe here in the second quarter and a little bit in the third quarter a little bit higher than normal but not over the course of the year.","Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.","Right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Deepa B. N. Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon, Adam and Craig. A couple questions...","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Good afternoon, Deepa.","Deepa B. N. Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","A couple questions on outlook, specifically in automotive. Could you talk about some of the regional performances that either came in better or worse than your expectation coming into the year and what they could mean for outlook? And also I'm looking for any confirmation that your underlying organic growth in automotive and industrial is still high-single-digits. You report it as mid-to high teens. Just if you can compare and contrast how the quarter progressed across regions, what that means for outlook, that'll be helpful.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah, sure. Well, just simple answer on your final part of the question, the organic growth outlook, we still think that is in the high single-digits, very robust outlook for the year on both auto and industrial. And then we have the benefits of some of the acquisitions that we've talked pretty extensively about.","Relative to the auto outlook and the performance on a regional basis I think I talked about the fact that we're very pleased in the first quarter that we had double-digit growth really in all regions and strong double-digit growth I would say in all those regions.","And I think that's just a testament to our team's great work in diversifying the business from a geographical perspective in addition to customer, in addition to application and product. And that is a big change for the company. If you look over the last half decade or so, we were predominantly a European automotive player. And today, it's a much, much more balanced position.","Now, I wish I could tell you that we were sophisticated enough to have detailed and scientific guidance per region in our automotive business, and then, I'd be able to tell you that we do better or worse in each region, but we're maybe not that sophisticated.","I think that we had strong performance in the quarter in all the regions. I don't think we were terribly surprised by one or another given region, or there's anything really special to report from one of the regions. I think our growth was fastest in Asia, and that was followed by Europe and then North America. I think that hasn't been a new trend necessarily.","Of course, we had the acquisition of Sunpool at the end of the fourth quarter, which supported our Asian growth, but we had also good organic growth in Asia. So, I don't think regionally, we have any change to our outlook. We continue to feel very good about the company's broad position really around the world.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I do have two, if I could. First on broadband, understood the slightly better view for this year. Can you talk about what geographic region or regions may be driving that? And if any of that is potentially price increases? I think some of your competitors have talked about trying to put in place because of rising copper prices. And are you seeing higher prices maybe start to take hold?","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah. I think the broadband growth \u2013 again, it's modestly better performance and I guess, I would say, that's more related to North America than other regions. Well, look, we're waiting for the price increase dynamic to change, and we're looking very much forward to that. I've said it before many times. We won't let the sun set on an opportunity to raise prices when the material prices have gone up like they have in broadband. I can't tell you that our outlook \u2013 the change in our outlook is related yet to pricing. That, we have not yet seen. But, we're hopeful apparently like you are that that could happen.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And then, a follow-up on mobile networks, which I know came in a little bit better. Any regional drivers on a geographic basis that caused this somewhat better mobile networks outlook? And appreciate the comments about not seeing any real benefit yet from 5G, but given all the engagement Amphenol has with different customers, do you have any view of when 5G may become a more material driver to your mobile networks business? Thank you.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Thanks very much, Mark. I think regionally, our performance in mobile networks was strongest in the quarter in North America. I think if I survey where we participate, that's probably the region where we've seen a little bit more momentum than we had anticipated coming into the year, and where we will continue to see that through the last three quarters of the year.","Relative to 5G, it's very true. We have very close relationships with our customers, both OEMs and service providers. And we're working very broadly on a wide array of next-generation technologies, both interconnect and antennas, that will be incorporated into next-generation systems.","All that being said, I cannot tell you when those real scale investments will be. Like everybody, I have read all the reports and heard some of them even firsthand about initial build-outs being done in certain places or targets of doing certain build-outs associated with certain events, like the Olympics and other things like that.","But, in terms of when the real build-out will come and when you will see a true change in the spending associated with that build-out or a transition from current generation to next generation and the broad spending patterns of our customers, that, we don't have a good visibility on yet. But what we will be regardless is poised to take advantage of it when it comes.","And I think there are always with \u2013 in the mobile networks market, just aspects of that that are hard to predict. There are combinations of companies that come. There's continued innovation that has to happen. You have to have also the innovation that happens on the devices that ultimately connect to the network. You have the availability of capital. You have capital markets. All those things ultimately go into the calculus of our customers whether they're going to ultimately drive a different level of spending and in adoption of those new networks. And we'll be ready whenever that does happen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Giordano of Cowen. Your line is now open.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi guys. Good afternoon.","Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.","Hi, Joe.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Craig, just had a quick clarification for you. With your free cash flow guide for the year, slightly better than conversion than \u2013 well, to approximate net income or slightly better than net income, is that adjusting for the pension payment this quarter or is that inclusive of that spend?","Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah. I was actually \u2013 well specifically I was talking about operating cash flow but...","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay.","Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.","... anyway certainly free cash flow is certainly we were talking. When we talk about our targets, we do talk about operating cash flow exceeding kind of net income and historically we've done usually even a little bit better than that, but that is \u2013 I think you have to really put in this one-time kind of voluntary contribution of the $80 million and then certainly that will have some impact on the operating cash flow for the year, but certainly from a payback perspective, from a return on investment perspective, that just made all the sense in the world. We've got a nice tax deduction under the current regime that we won't get under the new regime, and also certainly it reduces the cost of the plan quite significantly over a period of time, but anyways, to answer your question, yeah, you really probably would have to consider the payment that we made to the pension.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And then on commercial aero, I think you guys said sales up like 9% organically, 14% in U.S. dollars and expecting low-single-digits for the full year, is that correct? And if so, like what's kind of driving that change from here? Is it comp? The comps looked okay when I look back to last year. So just some color there would be helpful.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Well, I mean if you mean the change from the performance in Q1 to a little bit less of an outlook for the full year, I think this is just the normal cadence that we see. Sometimes, it depends on the comparisons. I think we had probably a little bit of a more favorable comparison in Q1 of this year than we had in last year in some of the other quarters and so I wouldn't read anything more into that than maybe it has to do with the compares from last year.","Operator","The next question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just had a quick follow-up. Craig, on the cash flow conversion, even if I adjust for the pension payment, I think I get cash flow conversion at 80% in the March quarter. That's well below the 100% average you guys have had for five years. So, would you call out something specific that impacted cash flow conversion, again, adjusting for pension plan in March? And how does that true-up as you go out?","Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.","Sure. Thanks. Thanks, Amit. Appreciate the question. Yeah. I mean I think that certainly, the cash flow \u2013 we generated a lot of cash flow and then I think this really \u2013 one quarter can vary from another quarter. We saw this in the third quarter of last year where we had a little bit lower cash flow because of the dynamics of the quarter in terms of when revenue was ramping into the fourth quarter. And then obviously, we had a very strong fourth quarter that was a little bit back-end weighted as fourth quarters normally are. So certainly, that did have some impact on the first quarter cash flow in addition to the fact that, but working capital needs coming into the second quarter which we are expecting some increase into the second quarter.","So our working capital from a kind of cash collection cycle perspective wasn't significantly different than kind of what our normal kind of range would be. It certainly was a little bit higher, and the first quarter sometimes could be a little bit softer. So I wouldn't necessarily note anything specific other than working capital needs in the first quarter. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I do expect the full year to kind of be typically strong where we would be over that 100% mark again, taking into account the pension payment that I just talked about before. So, nothing specific other than again quarters can vary from one to another. And sometimes we have very strong quarters and another times, for different reasons, usually working capital needs ramps when we have a little bit softer, but nothing from a longer-term perspective, that I would note.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Thank you very much, Amit. Sorry that you had gotten cut-off before.","Operator","We show no further questions at this time.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Great. Well, listen, and thank you all very much. We truly appreciate all of your interest in the company and we wish that you have a very nice spring. It's rainy here in Wallingford. Hopefully, where you are, the sun is shining and we look forward to talking to all of you here in about 90 days. Thanks again. Bye-bye.","Craig A.

[Operator Instructions] At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Ms. Diana Reardon. Ma'am, you may begin.","Diana G. Reardon","Thank you. My name is Diana Reardon, and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we'd like to welcome you all to our first quarter earnings call. Q1 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial comments on the quarter, and Adam will then give an overview of the business and current trends, and we'll then have a question-and-answer session.","The company had a good start to 2013, with first quarter sales of $1,080,000,000 and EPS before onetime items of $0.87 cents, meeting the high end of the company's guidance and growing sales 10% and EPS 13% over last year. Sales were up 10% in both U.S. dollars and local currencies compared to Q1 of 2012. And from an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and foreign exchange impacts, sales in Q1 2013 were up 4% from last year.  From a sequential perspective, sales were down 6% in U.S. dollars and 7% organically from a record Q4. Breaking down sales into our 2 major components, our cable business, which comprised 8% of our sales in the quarter, was up 14% from last year, with sales from a 2012 acquisition offsetting lower sales in our traditional cable products. The Interconnect business, which comprised 92% of our sales, was up 10% from last year as a result of both increased demand and prior-year acquisitions, and Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.","Operating income was $207 million in the quarter compared to $185 million last year. Operating margin was 19.2% in Q1, up from 18.9% in Q1 2012, a good conversion margin on incremental sales of approximately 22% from last year. From a segment standpoint, in the cable segment, margins were 13.8%, down from 14.5% last year. The decline in margins from last year relates primarily to a favorable product mix in the prior-year quarter.","In the Interconnect business, margins were 21.4%, up from 21% last year. The year-over-year interconnect operating margin improvement primarily reflects the positive impact of higher volume and cost reduction actions. We are very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement, and continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and culture of cost control allows us to react in a fast and flexible manner, thereby, constantly adjusting the business to maximize profitability in what clearly continues to be a very dynamic environment.  Through the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins again in Q1, and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance.","Interest expense for the quarter was $15.5 million compared to $13.7 million last year, reflecting higher average debt levels from the company's stock buyback program and the higher interest expense associated with the company's January 2012 note offering. Other income was $2.8 million in the quarter, up from $2.2 million last year, primarily as a result of higher interest income and higher levels of cash and short-term cash investments.","The company's effective tax rate, excluding the impact of onetime items, was approximately 26.7% in Q1 of 2013 and Q1 of 2012, and we currently expect the same rate for the full year of 2013, again, excluding the impact of any onetime items. On an as-reported basis, the company's effective tax rate was 20.9% in Q1 2013 and included income tax benefits of approximately $11 million or $0.07 per share, resulting from the delay by the U.S. government and the reinstatement of certain federal income tax provisions for the year 2012 relating primarily to research and development credits and certain U.S. taxes on foreign income. Such tax provisions were reinstated on January 2, 2013, with a retroactive effect to 2012.  Under U.S. GAAP, the related benefit of $11 million or $0.07 a share was recorded as a onetime benefit in the first quarter of 2013.","Net income, excluding onetime items, was approximately 13% of sales, and EPS, excluding onetime items, increased 13% to $0.87 this quarter from $0.77 last year, a strong performance. On an as-reported basis, EPS was $0.94 in the first quarter of 2013 and included that onetime tax item that I just mentioned. Orders for the quarter were a strong $1,120,000,000, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio in Q1 of approximately 1.04:1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash and achieved cash flow from operations in the quarter of $180 million or 118% of net income. The company continues to target and achieve cash flow from operations in excess of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory declined 3% from December and was $712 million at the end of March. Inventory days were at 86 days, up 3 days from December and down 2 days from prior-year levels.  Accounts receivable was $862 million. Days sales outstanding was 73 days, up 3 days from prior year levels and 1 day from December. Accounts payable was $446 million at March 31 and 54 days, down 2 days from last quarter and comparable to last year.","The strong cash flow from operations of $180 million, along with proceeds from option exercises of $39 million, was used primarily for capital expenditures for the purchase of 1.2 million shares of the company's stock of $85 million, repayment of borrowings under the company's credit facilities of $18 million, and an increase in cash and cash investments of $79 million in the quarter. The company had 8.8 million shares remaining under its stock repurchase program at the end of March, and that program expires in January of 2015. Cash and short-term investments were $1,022,000,000 at the end of March, the majority of which was held outside the U.S. and debt was $1,688,000,000, bringing net debt to $666 million at the end of the quarter. Borrowings and availability under our revolving credit facility were $491 million and $509 million respectively, and the company's leverage and interest coverage ratios remain very strong at 1.6x and 17x respectively. EBITDA in the first quarter was approximately $0.25 billion.","From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter and a good start to the year. Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends.","R. Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you, very much, Diana, and let me take this opportunity as well to welcome all of you to our first quarter earnings call. I'm going to spend a few moments to highlight several of our first quarter achievements. I then plan to discuss the trends and the progress in our various served markets. Then, finally, I'll make a few comments on our outlook for the second quarter, as well as the full year 2013, leaving time at the end for some questions.","In the first quarter, we are very pleased to report our results at the high end of guidance, despite what is clearly continuing uncertainties in the global economic environment. Revenues increased 10% from prior year, and declined as expected by 6% sequentially. As Diana mentioned, orders were a very strong, $1,120,000,000, representing a book-to-bill of 1.04:1 and creating confidence for our future performance. We're especially pleased that despite the sequential decline in sales, we once again generated industry-leading operating margins, with first quarter return on sales of 19.2%. With these results, I'm once again very proud of our agile entrepreneurial organization, as we continue to capitalize on the opportunities that are being created by the revolution in electronics and are demonstrating the discipline and drive necessary to deliver strong operating performance for the company.","Our management team continues to strive for a level of market diversification that once again, in the first quarter, has created significant value for the company. As we look at those served markets, turning first to the military market, the military market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market were flat to both prior year and prior quarter. The stronger sales of our products are incorporated into both avionics equipment, and sophisticated ordinance was offset by an overall moderation in purchasing activities by defense equipment manufacturers. Not surprisingly, uncertainties in the defense budgets of the U.S. and Western Europe continue to create conservatism among customers in these geographies. While we expect these uncertainties to continue, we are seeing still clear indications of expanding investments in new electronic functionalities in military equipment, as well as opportunities for growth in many developing geographies. We expect demand in the military market to remain slightly below these levels in the second quarter, as well as for the remainder of 2013. Nevertheless, we believe our technology leadership, together with the broad program participation, positions us to benefit long-term from the expanding adoption of electronics and military hardware.","The commercial aerospace market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased a very strong 15% from prior year and 8% sequentially on increased jet liner production, together with our expanded content on new airliner platforms. Despite some widely reported delays in certain new programs, we remain very encouraged that new airplane platforms are incorporating innovative electronic features at a very rapid pace. These innovations require new higher technology interconnect solutions both to enhance fuel efficiency, as well as to improve overall passenger experience and usability of the airplane. Looking forward, we expect sales in the Commercial Air market to increase further in the second quarter, and have overall a very positive outlook for this market in 2013 and beyond.","Our sales to customers in the very diverse industrial market represented 13% of sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased by 8% from prior year, as the benefit from last year's acquisition of Nelson-Dunn offset lower overall market demand in the quarter. Sales in the industrial market increased by 2% sequentially from the fourth quarter. While there are certain segments of the industrial markets that have been impacted by weaker economies especially in Europe, we continue to make excellent progress, broadening our technology offering, while also increasing our penetration of the many exciting growth segments of this market. In particular, we've made great progress in oil and gas, alternative energy, rail mass transit and factory automation, all of which position us very strongly for the future. We expect the overall industrial market to strengthen further in the second quarter, as new interconnect technologies are adopted across a wide array of these and other applications.","The automotive market represented for us 12% of sales in the quarter. Sales increased 9% from prior year and a strong 17% sequentially as we participated strongly in an increase in production volumes of vehicles that are incorporating an increasingly wide variety of new electronics. We're very excited to see the results of our expansion into new high-technology automotive applications, and we are realizing the benefits of our recent acquisitions combined with our long-term organic product development efforts. No question that automakers are incorporating electronics into more and more new areas of performance management, fuel efficiency and passenger infotainment, all of which are creating great opportunities for Amphenol. We expect sales in the automotive market to increase further in the second quarter, as our participation in new programs continues to expand, and we look forward to further long-term progress in this exciting market.","The mobile devices market represented for us 18% of sales in the quarter. Sales increased a very strong 21% from prior year, as our sales of new high-technology products onto new mobile computing platforms more than offset slower growth in mobile-phone-related products. As expected, sales declined 28% from our very strong fourth quarter results due to the combination of both normal seasonality, together with post-ramp reductions in the volume of certain new programs. We expect a moderate increase of demand going into the second quarter, driven in particular by increasing sales of products for new mobile computing devices, including especially tablets, as well as laptops and ultrabooks. We have a very strong technology position in this important and very dynamic end market due to a comprehensive portfolio of products for mobile devices, as well as our preferred supplier relationships with essentially all major device makers.","The mobile networks market represented 10% of sales in the quarter. Sales increased a robust 13% from prior year, primarily due to stronger sales of our cell site installation products, and decreased by 3% from the fourth quarter on normal seasonality. We are encouraged to have now realized 2 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth in the mobile infrastructure market, as operators in certain geographies have begun to increase their spending on LTE, as well as other next-generation networks. It remains, however, too early to predict the full recovery in this market. That being said, in the second quarter, we do expect a further increase in demand, as operators continue to ramp up their network build-outs in order to relieve the gaps in both coverage and capacities, which continue to exist in many wireless systems. We look forward to further long-term strength in the mobile networks market, driven by our broad designing positions on new base station platforms, as well as by our strong position with a diverse range of global wireless operators.","The Information Technology and Data Communications market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased by 5% from prior year, led by growth in our products incorporated in particular into servers and storage equipment. Sequentially, sales declined by 5% due to continued moderation in procurement activity by customers in the IT market, together with normal seasonality. As our customers continue to strive for new levels of equipment performance in order to handle a dramatic expansion of data traffic, our pipeline of new design opportunities with our next-generation products has strengthened significantly. In particular, we are working with many customers to help them design new systems that can handle the tremendous expansion of video traffic, while at the same time reducing overall power consumption. We expect demand to strengthen from these levels in the second quarter, as sales of these new high-performing -- high performance products accelerate.","The broadband market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased a strong 14% from prior year as the benefits of the Holland acquisition made in the fourth quarter offset a moderation demand by U.S. and international cable operators. Sales were down slightly from prior quarter on customer seasonality. We are very encouraged to see the emerging benefits of our product and customer diversification, which combined with the Holland acquisition, has enabled us to grow our range of broadband customers, while at the same time offering a more complete interconnect product offering. This expanded offering has been very well-received by our customers in the broadband market. We expect sales in this market to increase by somewhat more than normal seasonality in the second quarter, as we benefit from new customer wins, and we look forward to excellent long-term performance in the broadband market.","In summary, with respect to the first quarter, we are extremely proud of our organization, as we have continued to execute well in what continues to be a very challenging and dynamic market environment. Amphenol's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across our many diverse markets, the company's worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure and most critically, our agile entrepreneurial management team.","Now turning to our outlook for the second quarter and based on constant exchange rates, as well as normal seasonal patterns, we now expect in the second quarter as well as for the full year 2013 the following results. We expect sales in the range of $1,115,000,000 to $1,140,000,000 and $4,580,000,000 to $4,655,000,000 respectively. We expect EPS in the range of $0.92 to $0.95 in the second quarter and $3.76 to $3.85 for the full year respectively. For the full year, these results would represent sales and EPS growth of 7% to 8% and 8% to 11%, respectively. We are very encouraged by the strong outlook in both sales and earnings, especially given the many continuing uncertainties in the global economy. The ongoing revolution in electronics continues to create for our company a tremendous number of opportunities. I am confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to continue to capitalize on these opportunities to both grow our market position, as well as expand our profitability, and thereby ultimately to drive the continued superior performance for Amphenol.","Thank you very much, and operator, at this time, we'd be very happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just 2 questions from my side. One, first, broadly, could you just maybe just touch on the demand trends you saw in terms of linearity in the March quarter just in terms of did March end up on a soft notes or were things fairly stable throughout the quarter?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes, thank you very much, Amit. I think the first quarter was not different from most first quarters, where January was a strong month, February with Chinese New Year, as you can imagine, was not as strong and the quarter finished very well in March. So nothing really abnormal in the demand trends.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Fair enough. And then maybe if I just look at the capital allocation right now, I mean, you guys are sitting on a little over $1 billion of cash on hand. The debt load's obviously manageable. When you think about future capital usage, and I realize M&A is a key part of it, can you just tell me maybe, is it realistic for you to sustain the buyback base of 1 million shares a quarter on a fairly consistent basis for not just 2013, but potentially longer-term as well?","Diana G. Reardon","Yes, I think that, Amit, we don't guide to incremental share buybacks when we give guidance for the company. I think that what we said in the past would still be consistent as we look out into the future, and that is that we do try to have a balanced approach to the deployment of the company's financial strength. As you mentioned, the acquisition program clearly is the #1 priority because it provides the best both top line and bottom line growth potential for the company over the long-term, but we have over the last few years. Certainly, it's been active from a stock buyback program, and also we'll consider and continue to look at the dividends. But I think if you look back and look at the way that we deployed the stock buyback in the past few years, it wouldn't be an unreasonable assumption to think that we would probably continue that, again, borrowing whatever capacity we think we need to sustain the acquisition program in the future.","Operator","Next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to ask a question, Adam, regarding your commentary on the defense area, where that's obviously going to be weak this quarter, and then you said that you expected it to be down for the year. Do you expect to see a flattening out in terms of orders, particularly as we get through the fear portion of this sequestration? Or do you expect it to be even weaker? And then as a follow-up to that, as you see this weakness, are you taking any cost-cutting actions in place in order to preserve the margins in that business?","R. Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much, Matt, for the question. I think what I meant to say in the prepared remarks is we would expect it to be slightly down in the second quarter. We expect it to sort of be at those levels throughout the course of the year. We don't expect a kind of quarter-by-quarter continual reduction in demand. I think that the market has been soft for some quarters, and all the anticipation of what has been going on in the government spending arena with sequestration and otherwise. Now you can bet that our actions at the factory level, at the organizational level, at the SG&A level are appropriate, given the amount of demand that we have seen, and that organization is extremely agile. They have taken the actions to reallocate resources to higher growth areas, to remove those resources that are not necessary, whether in the factory or otherwise, and that's something that we will continue to do always in Amphenol in real time. I mean, if you just look across the company on roughly a 6% sequential reduction in sales in the first quarter, our headcount was also down by about 6% in the quarter. So that's something that we always as a company -- we don't wait for the market to tell us otherwise. Our general managers are constantly reacting in real time to whatever changes in demand may come. If demand moves up in military, if it were to do that, then they would make appropriate adjustments on that side as well.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And is it fair to say that on the margin side, that the Commercial Aerospace part of the businesses has a similar margin profile so as you expand that, that should offset any of the margin weakness from the defense side?","Diana G. Reardon","I think we make good money in all of our markets. And so I think there is certainly a distinction, if you look from a segment perspective, between the cable business and the interconnect business, but we're talking about -- interconnect business is what  we're primarily talking about. With these markets, we -- the change in market presence historically has not had an impact on margin, and we wouldn't expect that going forward.","Operator","Next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","When we think about your company is faced with a interesting decision, contemplating your all-time high cash levels right now, which is a great situation to have. But unfortunately, banks like Citibank aren't paying a lot of interest rate these days. So can you talk a little bit about -- you did not make any M&A acquisitions this quarter. Did anything slow down in the acquisition pipeline or anything with the taxes or the sequester that impacted the M&A or should we just say that it just happened to be the -- an item based on the calendar and how timing happens to rollout with M&A?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes, well, Jim, thank you very much for the question. I mean, we're all very proud that the company continuous to be a great generator of cash. And as Diana said, our top priority for that cash continues to be the M&A program. Last year, we had a very successful year in the M&A program. We made 5 acquisitions in 5 totally different markets, which added tremendous, tremendous new platforms of growth for the company. And you know after having followed the company for so many years, that acquisitions are not coming regularly every quarter, every month or whatever. They come on a very regular basis. We work them through our pipeline, but at the end of the day, when you get ultimately the seller to decide to sign the paper and close the deal to us, that's something that is very hard to predict. I'm not going to tell you that we will close a deal every quarter like we were fortunate to do last year, but we still have a very, very robust pipeline of acquisitions. You mentioned the tax issue from last year, where by maybe on the margin, there may have been some sellers who if they were already destined to sell at some point, the coming tax changes of 2012 or at the year end of 2012 may have on the margin pushed them slightly over the edge. That was not though such a major driver of why we were able to do those acquisitions. We are constantly working with companies in a variety of industries across the real breadth of the markets that we serve to incubate that acquisition pipeline. And that's something that we continue to do, and where we continue to believe that there's great opportunities for further acquisitions in the coming quarters and years. Whether those will come in the second quarter, in the third quarter, that, we can't tell you right now. But certainly, at such time as we do that, you will be the first to know and we'll be very proud to have those. The company, Amphenol, remains today in this industry what I would call the acquirer of choice. Our track record of having completed more than 50 acquisitions over the last dozen years and the unique entrepreneurial way that we organize our company is extremely attractive when you talk to outside companies, and that attractiveness has not changed. So we look very much forward to continuing to deploy our cash towards acquisitions in addition to the various other levers for cash deployment that Diana has talked about. When that will come here, again, we will let you know when it happens.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And as a quick follow-up, raw material prices have been pretty volatile in the most recent couple of months, whether it be copper or aluminum or those. Can you help remind us about the ability of cash passthrough or does Amphenol kind of benefit when the copper goes down? Or is it more you purchase and you use it and have to manufacture it, and you don't see it for a quarter or 2 down the road? Just kind of impact of raw materials for your company as we think about modeling going forward and the fluctuations of kind of copper, aluminum, what they've been doing.","Diana G. Reardon","Sure. Look, I think,  it seems in the last few weeks that there's been a pretty big movement down in certain commodity cost. You mentioned copper, gold, and I guess that we would be the first to applaud and be pleased if such an environment continues and these prices continue to come down and clearly, if they do come down, once you work through existing inventories that are on hand, clearly, we would -- there would be a reduction in cost for us and for the rest of those who use those materials. I think that the impact on margin is a somewhat more complicated equation that also has to do with what happens to pricing and demand in an environment like that. But what I can tell you is that if there is a margin enhancement opportunity that presents itself because we do get into a better environment from a commodity perspective, I think that the team here certainly would be the first to capitalize on it and would be thrilled to be in an environment that was different than it has been in the last few years where commodities have really been a big pressure, I think, for all manufacturers. So we certainly look forward to hopefully having the opportunity to see those costs at a lower level, but the impact on margin ultimately will depend upon also that balance with the pricing environment.","Operator","The next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Adam, had a couple of questions on your end markets. I think you talked about auto sales being up 17% sequentially, definitely very surprised to see that number as robust as it was. I mean, it sounds like it's more than just production and content growth. It sounds like you might be gaining some share or whether there's some program ramps. Would love to get some color in terms of how we think about that 17% growth. And then maybe just on your Wireless Infrastructure segment, if you could give us some color in terms of geographic trends and how that's trending between your antenna business and your base station interconnect business.","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes, well, thank you very much, Amitabh, for the questions. And first, with respect to automotive, we were also very happy with the 17% growth. I mean, just remember, our automotive business has been on a great trajectory for the last 3 or so years. If we go back to the kind of the beginnings of 2009, automotive represented for 5%, 6% of sales. In this quarter, it was 12% of sales. So we have really executed on the strategy that we've been talking about, which was to drive organic new product development [indiscernible] at the same time as we complement that with some very, very nice high-technology acquisitions. [indiscernible] in addition to a little bit of normal seasonality. It was clearly the result from new programs that are ramping up, share gains that we have been able to capitalize upon with customers around the world. And that is something that we feel has the potential to continue as we look forward to an automotive business that has a lot of momentum behind it for Amphenol. The basis of all of that has been the fact, and not a new topic that I have mentioned in the past, is really the fact that we see in the car today more electronics applications that allow us to create true value in our interconnect products for our customers, and thereby to realize the profitability returns that we would expect to have. That just was not the case historically in the automotive market, and today, we just see more and more new applications that are coming out that allow us to really participate. And we're participating with components, and we're participating with real significant interconnect value-add products with customers around the world. Now relative to Wireless Infrastructure, we were again very pleased to see 2 quarters in a row of growth on a year-over-year basis. I mentioned that the growth driver this quarter was more what I would call the sell-side installation products. These include our antenna products [indiscernible] growing array of interconnect products that go into sites, sold both to operators, as well as to OEMs. And so we actually feel very good about the momentum in that part of the market. Now ultimately, will the operators on a worldwide basis continue to drive spending that we all know is necessary to support the coverage and the capacity of these overly stressed networks? That, I think, still remains to be seen, and that's why we remain cautious about that market going forward, but to the extent that the spending happens, our position in the market, both with OEMs, as well as with operators, is very, very strong. Now you also alluded to the geographical trends in that market and I think, not surprisingly, North America has been probably, as a result, North America was where smartphones and tablets and whatnot first exploded onto the scene. North America seems to still be the place that has some of the most robust growth and robust investments in these next-generation networks. We're hopeful that China will be following behind. Europe, it still remains to be seen, how the economics are going to work out there relative to when that investment schedule will happen. Ultimately, we all know it has to happen, and we will be there to participate when it does.","Operator","Next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Adam, could you perhaps comment on how much of your portfolio you compete with the Japanese connector manufacturers? And are you seeing any change in their pricing strategies, given this humongous move here in the yen?","R. Adam Norwitt","No, thank you very much, Wamsi. It's a very interesting question. In all honesty, we don't compete a tremendous amount with a lot of companies from Japan. As you know, we traditionally don't have a huge Japanese business. That has not been historically a huge market for us, and I would tell you that I don't personally have any real anecdotal evidence about pricing behavior because we just don't -- we are not really going head-to-head so frequently with the more well-known companies in Japan.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And another pricing question, I guess, this one on circular connectors, have you noticed any change in pricing now that Deutsche has been part of TE for several quarters?","R. Adam Norwitt","Again, I wouldn't say that there's been any noticeable change that would be at all meaningful to the company. I'd still go back to the fact that when that company was acquired, they broadly talked about that they wanted to increase the margins of the company, and we continue to look forward to them trying to do that by being disciplined on pricing, and so, no, I have not seen any dramatic changes there.","Operator","Next question comes from Brian White with Topeka.","Brian John White - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Adam, when you talked about some of the new systems in IT and data, supporting video whatnot, I assume you're talking more networking than servers?","R. Adam Norwitt","No, to be honest, I'm talking about it both because you're seeing now more and more converge systems, Brian, and so the -- where servers and storage and networking equipment were traditionally very, very distinct pieces of equipment, that's not always the case anymore. And so I think that some of these next gen systems, there will be more and more conversions. We saw strength in the quarter in storage as well as in servers. We didn't see as much strength in networking in the quarter, but our ongoing design activities are really across all 3 of those areas, and I think the fact is, is video taxes all of them. You got to process the video. You got to store it somewhere, and you got to route it around the world when people want to consume it. And so what we have heard and seen with all of our customers across all those equipment verticals is that the nature of data and the volume of data that they need to be able to process in these systems is just mind boggling in many ways. I mean, the logarithmic growth in this video-based data traffic is incredible. And we see that whether one is designing a new server, a new storage system, a router, a switch, you name it. That is sort of the common story that we're hearing from all of our customers. And we're very fortunate because we have been a leader in high-speed technology in the real core of these IT systems, starting with the backplane system that came out of our acquisition with TCS and expanding throughout to I\/O connectors to cable assemblies and beyond. And our continued drive to create leadership in that market with next gen systems that push the limits of copper capabilities, which is what customers truly want to have has really positioned us well. We also see that power is an area of all these equipment. Again, whether that be storage, servers or networking, where our customers are struggling with how do they deliver to their end customers a new value proposition, which is thus that operating cost will be lower and power consumption will be lower. And so we've seen a lot more innovation around the power interconnect bus bars, power management systems, whereby, if you can help them with -- drive further efficiency in that system, that creates a lot of value for the customers, and thereby, allows us to capture business at good margins.","Brian John White - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And just on the mobile device market, I want to be clear, we'll see growth in tablets and ultrabooks sequentially in the June quarter, but not in smartphones?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes, I think what we look forward to in the June quarter, we think there can be moderate growth overall in the market, and as has been the case for a number of quarters, we see more of that growth being driven by what I term these mobile computing devices as opposed to just simple phones.","Operator","Next question comes from Mike Wood with Macquarie Capital.","Adam Baumgarten - Macquarie Research","This is Adam, in for Mike. Just a quick question. Can you talk about some of the trends you're seeing in China post Chinese New Year since we've been kind of removed for a while at this point?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes, well, I like your name, Adam. I think in China, we have seen, I'd say, normal trends. I think we are very happy to see that relative to our factories that the kind of typical disruption from a manufacturing standpoint that we saw, we saw that last year, we saw it probably the year before, seems to have been a little bit more smooth this year. And that's reflected also in our customers, and so to that extent, because our customers also didn't have these big kind of tumultuous labor turnovers, that allowed our demand to be also, I'd say, more normal in the quarter. Obviously, February is low in China. March tends be a comeback and that was no different relative to the overall Chinese economy and the overall demand in China. Again, we haven't seen anything really out of the ordinary or notable beyond the fact that it's still a market that grows at 2 or 3x the rate of most of the developed economies in the West, and that creates a lot of opportunities for us in a variety of markets that we participate in there.","Operator","Next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was just looking at your book-to-bill of, I think, it was 1.04 for the March quarter, and that's typically a book-to-bill above 1 is a positive indicator, but you guys typically see a book-to-bill above 1, decently above 1 in your March quarter. How indicative do you think your book-to-bill is this year of strengthening trends for you as we move into next quarter and for the year?","Diana G. Reardon","Sure, I think as you pointed out, it is normal for us to have a good book to bill in the first quarter. And if you would go back over the last probably 4 or 5 years, probably 50% of that time, the book to bill is probably 1.03 to kind of 1.04 kind of range. So I wouldn't say it's an abnormally high book-to-bill ratio, but I would on the other hand say that it certainly is a strong orders. I think the order level is up something like 9% on a year-over-year basis, and so it is, I think, a positive sign. That does confirm the sequential increase in sales that you see in our guidance in Q2. So I wouldn't say -- again, it's not an abnormally high book-to-bill, but it certainly is a good one and I think that supports the Q2 guidance.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just looking at your segments, Adam, I think most of your commentary was for seeing sequential improvements in all of the end markets with the exception of military. Can you give us some sense of where you expect a bit more strength, which segments do you see as being a bit stronger in the second quarter as we move through the year, being above that sort of, I think, you guided to about 4% sequentially increase in revenue? So which segments are going to be above that corporate average?","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure, well, thank you very much, Sherri. I think maybe in order of where we would see the strength, I think I mentioned that we expect in broadband, for example, to see somewhat substantially more than typical seasonality. And that's something that we feel very good about, given all the benefits that I talked about with the recent acquisition and the product expansion. We expect industrial to have good performance sequentially. Aerospace continues to look also like a market that would have good performance, and the IT market, actually, we anticipate that market probably performing a little bit better than the average in the quarter sequentially.","Operator","Next question comes from Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","2 questions. When considering the cable business, your margins were up from the back half of 2012. How much of that improvement is a function of market conditions relative to just the contribution from the M&A?","Diana G. Reardon","I think that there is some contribution from both, I would say, Shawn, in those numbers. There is some diversity relative to the product mix in the traditional business prior to the contribution of the acquisition. And I think when you -- if you would look at the sequential improvement as an example between Q4 and Q1, where we did have a good improvement in margin, that primarily was a stronger mix of sort of our traditional cable products. If you would look in the back half, I think there probably is more -- at the back half of 2012 probably a little bit more contribution from the acquisition, which does have in general a higher ROS level than some of our other products.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, and then as a follow-up, if I do my math correctly, and assuming the midpoint of guidance for the year, it implies you have to do something like $1.2 billion of revenues in the September and December quarters to reach the mid-point of the sales guidance. I guess, what would be the biggest drivers in the back half of the year for 2013? Last year, it was definitely mobile devices. Is that the same level of thinking and maybe the other end markets, that would be up significantly too?","Diana G. Reardon","I think that the communication market, in general, tend to be stronger in the second half of the year without getting into a discussion [ph]. Specifically, we just wanting to nail down the trends for each quarter for the full year by market would probably not be something we'd like to get into. But I think, in general, we would look to see a continuation of really what we're guiding to in Q2, which is a strengthening in most of the communications-related markets in the back half.","Operator","Next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on some of the recent trends that you've been seeing and maybe comment specifically on orders so far in the quarter, and then if you're seeing any changes in customer behavior such as expedites or pull-ins.","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes, I mean I wouldn't tell you that there's anything of note. We've given guidance here for the quarter and for the year, and I think the orders in the quarter, so far, certainly would support that guidance. And to the same -- by the same token, I would say that behavior of customers in the month of April compared to the month of March, there, we haven't seen any notable changes.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful, thank you. And then as my follow-up question, there's been a lot of change in the mobile device market, whereas some of the smartphones are getting larger and some of the tablets have been getting even smaller. Can you just talk about the opportunity from you from the changing mobile device ecosystem?","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure. Look, this is an ecosystem, as you termed it, that changes constantly. And so we have seen more than a decade that we've been having significant business in this market, that there's always change. There's change in form factors. There's change in functionality. There's change in what functions are integrated into those systems, and that is no different. No doubt about it, as you said, there are certain phones getting bigger. There are certain tablets getting smaller. There are new tablets coming. There are ultrabooks, which starts to behave like tablets. There are laptops start to behave like ultrabooks. I mean, you can get your head spinning when you start talking about the dynamics in that market, which is why we look at it much more simple. As we look at that market and how we have always approached that market is we will participate in a market where we can create value for our customers, where there's value in the innovations that we make through our interconnect, our antenna, our mechanism products that we sell into that market, whereby we help to make the customer's product better. And if we can do that for the customer, then, ultimately, they will pay us a reasonable price for the product, and we can have good progress with that business. That's what we have been able to do, in particular, on a lot of these new devices and as more new devices come out, mobile computing devices, to the extent that they need innovation, and I think it's a sure bet that somebody is going to need that innovation, then we will participate and have a good opportunity for growth in that market. But what it will be in the next quarter and the coming quarters, it is virtually impossible to predict with any degree of certainty very far down the road what that's going to be. But at the end of the day, I think one can rest assured that the innovation is going to be required by our customers, whoever they may be at the time, in order for them to sell the latest generation products to their customers and thereby be successful, and that's really the measure for us in terms of how we participate in that market. So obviously, it's a very important market for the company, one that is a very dynamic market and it's one where we have been extremely successful in the back of that very simple principle.","Operator","Our final question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research.","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","Just 2 quick questions. First of all, you mentioned, Adam, that you're expecting to see some benefits from new electronics functionality on the military side. Is that something that's going to occur this year or is this something that you're working on designs maybe for next year? And then secondly, I was just curious if we can get an update on just any changes or advances in your manufacturing footprint going through this calendar year? Obviously, you're well-positioned in China. I don't know if there's other changes we should think of relative to India, Mexico, et cetera, but it would be great to get an update there.","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure, well, thank you very much, Steve, appreciate the questions. I mean relative to new electronics in the military aerospace market, this is something that has been ongoing, and the fact is, is without our participation in some of these new electronics, even in the first quarter, our performance would have been much worse than it was. I mean, the overall spending environment is clearly not a favorable environment. And so it really is on our shoulders and on our organization around the world to continue to drive leading innovation. We're very fortunate though, because we have such a broad position and such a reputation as the technology leader in that market that customers come to us when they need to create those innovations. And now, the military equipment manufacturers, they got to differentiate. They cannot just live on a rising tide anymore, rather, they got to create this kind of more bang for the buck new technologies for their end customers, whatever government that may be around the world. And so we have seen tremendous participation in that, the new radar systems, for example, in the U.S. and Israel, early warning and missile-defense radars, things like that, where new electronics have been incorporated and which allows us to offset what would otherwise be budgetary pressures in that market. That is going to benefit for us in the first quarter. We believe it will continue to be a benefit for us, going forward, long-term. And when does that drive growth or not, obviously, there is an overall budgetary environment, which we would fight against, but that gives us a tremendous opportunity to have success, regardless of the budget. Relative to our manufacturing footprint, we operate a lot of factories around the world because we have a very unique organizational structure and just to remind everyone, that is a structure, whereby we have individual operating units with general managers, who truly run accountable businesses around the world. Part of being accountable is being flexible, and we pride ourselves on a constant degree of flexibility in how we make things and where we make things. These aren't decisions that Diana and I are making here in Wallingford, Connecticut. These are decisions that get made on the ground in realtime, depending on the needs of our customers and the requirements of the various dynamics of costs that are coming. So to that end, yes, we continue to operate in China. I think we have today 28 factories in China. We have significant people in China. But by the same token, we continue to strengthen in Mexico, in India, in Eastern Europe, and we continue to prospect for new locations to support customers around the world. And so it is an ongoing, very fluid manufacturing footprint for Amphenol, as we seek to continue to have that very flexible approach. At the same time, I should just say relative to China, yes, the costs in China have gone up and yes, the renminbi continues to appreciate, but we also have a lot of customers and a lot of business in China. China is a tremendous market for the company. And so I cannot imagine very easily a scenario whereby one would move production, say, to Mexico to reexport back to China. That's not something that probably would make a lot of sense. At the same time, though, we are seeing some movement of production back to North America and predominately to Mexico, where that makes sense for customers in this market. So it continues to be very dynamic, and we will continue to approach that with a degree of agility that we think is really typifying the Amphenol management style.","R. Adam Norwitt","Thank you so much, Steve. And if there are no other questions, we appreciate everybody's interest in the company, and hope that you also have some of the first signs of spring that we are seeing here in Wallingford, Connecticut. Thank you all very much.","Diana G.

[Operator Instructions] At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Ms. Diana Reardon. Ma'am, you may begin.","Diana G. Reardon","Thank you. My name is Diana Reardon, and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we'd like to welcome everyone to our Third Quarter Call.","Q3 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question-and-answer session.","The company closed the third quarter achieving new records in both sales and earnings per share, with sales just over $1.1 billion and EPS of $0.90, meeting the high end of the company's guidance. Sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currencies compared to Q3 of 2011.","From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency effects, sales in Q3 2012 were up 4% versus last year. Sequentially, sales were also up 4% in both U.S. dollars and organically from Q2 of 2012.","Breaking down sales into our 2 major components our cable business, which comprised 6% of our sales, was down 7% from both last year and last quarter due primarily to lower demand of specialty cable and international markets. The interconnect business, which comprised 94% of our sales, was up 8% from last year and 5% sequentially, and Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.","Operating income for the quarter was $216 million compared to prior year operating income, excluding onetime items of $199 million. Operating margin was 19.5% in Q3 2012 compared to 19.3% last year and 19.4% last quarter, a good conversion margin on incremental sales of approximately 22% sequentially and 24% from last year. Operating income is net of stock option expense of approximately $8 million or 0.7% of sales in both Q3 2012 and Q3 2011.","From a segment standpoint in our cable business, margins were 12.4%, down from 13.1% last year and 13.8% last quarter. The margin decline relates primarily to lower volume of somewhat less favorable pricing environment and some impact from product mix.","In the interconnect business, margins were 21.7%, up from 21.5% last year and 21.6% last quarter. The interconnect operating margin improvement primarily reflects the positive impact of higher volume and cost reduction actions.","We're very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement in the quarter. We continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and culture cost control allows us to continue to react in a fast and flexible manner, thereby constantly adjusting the business to maximize profitability in what clearly continues to be a very dynamic demand environment. To the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved sequential improvement in operating margins each quarter in 2012 and remains fully committed to driving future enhanced performance.","Interest expense in the quarter was $15 million compared to $10 million last year, reflecting higher average debt levels from the company's stock buyback program and the higher interest expense associated with the company's January senior note offering. Other income was $2.6 million in the quarter, up from $2.3 million last quarter primarily as a result of higher interest income on higher levels of cash and short-term cash investments.","In the third quarter, the company had an effective tax rate of 26.8%. This is approximately the same rate we had in the third quarter of 2011 and for the full year 2011, excluding the impact of onetime items, and we currently expect a similar rate in 2012.","Net income was approximately 13% of sales in Q3. And EPS grew 11% over last year, excluding onetime items from the prior year number; a very strong performance. Orders for the quarter were just under $1.1 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 0.99:1.","The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash and produced strong cash flow from operations of $176 million in the quarter. For the 9 months, operating cash flow stood at $468 million or approximately 112% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income.","From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $712 million at the end of September, up 5% over the June quarter. From an inventory days perspective, excluding the impact of acquisitions, inventory days were 83 and were comparable to prior year levels. Accounts receivable was $903 million at the end of September. And days sales outstanding were 72 days, excluding the impact of acquisitions, also comparable to prior year levels. Accounts payable was $478 million at 9\/30 and from a days perspective, was up about 1 day to 56 days at the end of the quarter.","Our strong cash flow from operations of $176 million, along with borrowings under the company's credit and receivables facilities of $63 million and proceeds in related tax benefits from option exercises of $46 million were used primarily to fund $33 million of capital expenditures, the purchase of 0.5 million shares of the company's common stock for $28 million, $97 million related to payment for the acquisitions of both Holland and Griffith in the quarter, dividend payments of $17 million and an $80 million increase in cash and cash investments in the quarter.","The company has approximately 2.5 million shares remaining under the 20 million-share buyback program that expires in January of 2014.","At the end of September, cash and short-term investments stood at $893 million, the majority of which is held outside the U.S. In addition, the company had availability under its revolving credit facilities of approximately $600 million at the end of the quarter.","Total debt at September 30 stood at $1.6 billion and net debt was approximately $712 million at the end of the quarter.","The company's leverage and interest coverage ratios remain very strong at 1.5x and 17x, respectively, and EBITDA in the quarter was $264 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance.","Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends.","R. Adam Norwitt","Well thank you very much, Diana. And I'd like to add my welcome to all of you on the phone today. I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the third quarter, then I plan to discuss our trends and the progress in our various served markets. Finally, I'm going to make some comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year of 2012.","With respect to the third quarter, we're extremely pleased that the company achieved our second consecutive quarter with record orders, sales and earnings, meeting the high end of guidance despite what are clearly rising levels of uncertainty in the global economy. Revenues in the quarter increased a strong 7% from prior year and 4% sequentially, reaching a new record of $1,103,000,000. As well, the company booked record orders of $1,098,000,000, representing a book-to-bill of just under 1:1. Our management team especially finds it rewarding that our continued focus on profitability has led to further expansion of our operating margins to 19.5%, a very strong level in any measure.","I remain extremely proud of our team. It is really in dynamic times like these when the true value of both the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization is most clearly revealed as we have continued to capitalize on the many available opportunities for growth while still focusing to drive superior operating performance.","We made significant progress in our acquisition program in the third quarter, completing 2 strategic acquisitions in important areas of the interconnect market. In August, we completed the acquisition of Griffith Enterprises, a U.S.-based manufacturer of value-add interconnect assemblies for the commercial aerospace market, a company with annual sales of approximately $15 million. This excellent acquisition builds upon our leading offering of high technology interconnect products to this high-growth segment and establishes important new value-add capabilities for our commercial air customers, in particular in North America.","In September we acquired Holland Electronics, an approximately $60 million revenue, U.S.-based supplier of interconnect components to the broadband market. We're especially excited that Holland adds a wide range of high-technology interconnect products to our broadband cable offering while also expanding our market presence outside of the traditional cable MSOs towards the higher-growth telecom and satellite TV providers.","Both of these strategic acquisitions are consistent with our long-standing strategy to acquire complementary companies with strong management, leading technology and excellent market presence. As we welcome these 2 excellent new teams to Amphenol, we remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create significant value for Amphenol in the future.","Turning to the trends and progress in our served markets. I believe our results in the third quarter confirm once again that our balanced end market diversification is a tremendous value for Amphenol, especially given the increasing levels of uncertainty in the global economy.","Turning first to the Military market. That market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were essentially flat to prior year as defense customers remained wary of extending commitments given the continuing budgetary uncertainties, in particular in many western countries. On a sequential basis, sales in the Military market declined by 5% on expected seasonality.","We expect demand to increase from these levels in the fourth quarter as we benefit from the effects of normal seasonality as well as from the ramp-ups of certain new military programs with high electronics content. While there clearly remains uncertainty in the defense budgets in many developed economies, we at Amphenol continue to make progress in creating new, high-technology solutions for advanced military electronics and we look forward to realizing further momentum from these efforts in the future.","The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in that market increased a very strong 18% from prior year as we continue to capitalize on increased demand resulting from higher levels of jet liner production as well as from the launch of new airplane platforms. Sequentially, sales decreased, as expected, from the second quarter on normal seasonality.","The commercial air market continues to be exciting for Amphenol as we're taking advantage of a real revolution of electronics adoption in these planes. New planes are incorporating electronics to create enhanced passenger experience and comfort, new levels of fuel efficiency and ease of operation for the airlines. Looking forward, we expect sales to increase sequentially in the fourth quarter and continue to have a very positive long-term outlook for the commercial air market.","The industrial market represented 14% of our sales in the quarter and sales in that market increased also a very strong 23% from prior year. As we benefited from the contribution of our prior acquisition as well as from continued strong demand in the oil and gas, alternative energy and factory automation segments. Sales in the industrial market were down sequentially by 5%, again on normal seasonality.","We continue to make excellent progress broadening our interconnect product offering and increasing our penetration of the many exciting growth segments of the industrial market. It is a market in which the electronics revolution continues to accelerate. We expect that given the current level of economic uncertainties, sales in the industrial market will remain at or about these levels in the fourth quarter. But nevertheless, we look forward to continued long-term momentum in this important sector for Amphenol.","The automotive market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter, and sales increased a strong 36% from prior year and were down slightly from the second quarter on typical seasonality. We continue to benefit from an ongoing increase in vehicle production volumes as well as new electronics applications, together with the important technology contributions that have come from our recent automotive acquisitions. In particular, we continue to make progress broadening our position with our key automotive customers as we take advantage of this expanded technology offering for new electronics applications in the cars.","We have begun to see some indications of a moderation of automotive demand, in particular among European automakers, and thus we expect sales to remain at the current levels in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, we look forward to continuing to expand our participation within the high-value applications in this important market.","The mobile devices market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased 2% from prior year on increased sales of products into new mobile computing platforms, which is partially offset by some degree of lower sales related to traditional and smartphones. We're especially pleased that our sales in this market increased a very strong 31% sequentially. This was driven by our participation in a diverse set of new program launches, in particular related to tablets and ultrabooks, what we call really mobile computing products.","Our diverse array of high-technology interconnect antenna and mechanism products, together with a highly reactive organization, has ensured that we strongly participate in a diverse range of new products. We expect further sequential growth in the mobile devices market in the fourth quarter, albeit at a more moderate pace, as we continue to participate in the ramp-ups of these new mobile computing products. And we remain very excited by the potential that these new platforms create for the company in the future.","The mobile networks market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. While sales decreased 5% from prior year, we are very pleased that sales increased sequentially for the third consecutive quarter, growing 5% from Q2.","The overall investment environment in the wireless infrastructure market continues to be challenging. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by our expanding positions with both equipment makers and operators, in particular on their next-generation systems and network buildouts. Although we expect demand to moderate slightly in the fourth quarter on traditional end-of-the-year seasonality, we look forward to further long-term strength in the future driven by our broad designing positions on new equipment and platforms as well as by our strong presence with wireless operators around the world.","The information technology and Datacom market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased 5% year-over-year and, as expected, were flat from the second quarter as we saw the pace of IT-related investments moderate. Regardless of that moderation, we continue to benefit from a variety of releases of next-generation servers and data center equipment, all of which is incorporating a broad array of our leading high-speed and power interconnect technologies. As our customers continue to strive for new levels of equipment performance in order to handle the dramatic expansion of data traffic, our pipeline of new design opportunities with our next-generation products continues to strengthen.","We anticipate a further slight reduction in demand among customers in the IT market in the fourth quarter as customers continue to moderate their spending plans given continuing economic uncertainty. Nevertheless, we look forward to further long-term gains as our new high technology solutions are increasingly adopted into our customers' next-generation systems.","Finally, the broadband market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter. Sales decreased 3% from prior year and were down slightly on a sequential basis in what is generally a stable demand environment. We continued to broaden our technology offering with new interconnect products at the same time as we are strengthening our position outside of the company's traditional markets. In particular, we're very excited by our expanded interconnect product offering resulting from the Holland acquisition and look forward to realizing significant value from this new platform for expansion. We expect sales in the broadband market to grow in the fourth quarter sequentially as the typical fourth quarter seasonal slowdown in MSO spending is more than offset by the benefits from the addition of Holland.","We are extremely proud, in summary, of our dynamic organization as we have continued to execute very well in what is no doubt an increasing uncertain market environment. We're particularly pleased with the company's new records in sales and earnings as well as with the continued expansion of our already industry-leading margins. Amphenol's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages: our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in a diverse range of markets, our worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure and most importantly, an agile entrepreneurial management team.","Now turning to the outlook. In recent months, there's been an increasing level of market uncertainty related to a range of fiscal and budgetary issues. Based on these considerations and assuming current currency exchange rates, we now expect the following results.","For the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1,095,000,000 to $1,115,000,000 and earnings per share in the range of $0.88 to $0.91. For the full year 2012, we expect sales in the range of $4,241,000,000 to $4,261,000,000 and EPS in the range of $3.41 to $3.44. For the full year, this guidance represents sales and EPS growth of roughly 8% and 12% to 13%, respectively.","Given the many uncertainties in the global economy, we are very encouraged by the strong outlook in sales and earnings, which reflects in particular the value of the diversification of the company as well as the discipline and agility of our management teams. Most importantly, the electronics revolution continues to create many opportunities for Amphenol. I remain extremely confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to continue to capitalize on these opportunities to both grow our market position and expand our profitability, and thereby to drive continued superior performance for Amphenol.","Operator, at this time, we'd be very happy to take any questions, if there might be.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jim Suva with Citi.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I have one question for Adam and one question for Diana. Adam, your success in mobile devices, can you help us understand, is it mostly tablets or cell phones that you're seeing success there? Because there's a lot of mixed things of what's going on in the industry, we've got some very big program builds. We're just trying to figure out if it's mostly tablets or cell phones. And then, Diana, you made some comments at the beginning of your prepared remarks about the lower demand in the specialty cable and the international markets. Is that more of an economic macro factor, or is there something structural going on, like wireless is picking up faster than coaxial cable? Or how should we think about your comment?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes, Jim, thank you very much. With respect to your first question on mobile devices, I -- we have mentioned, I think this is the second quarter running, that we see tremendous opportunity in what we call mobile computing platforms. And when I talk about mobile computing devices, that obviously includes tablets and ultrabooks and all those related devices. I mean in many ways, defining these devices becomes increasingly difficult. Each one that comes out seems to have features that come from other parts of them. They become almost like a hybrid device. And that's -- those are really the devices where we have seen the growth. We continue to have a strong participation in the smartphone world, but that is not where the growth is being driven from because we have seen in smartphones that there has been a trend towards more reliance on software as opposed to hardware. Our goal in the mobile device market is to create high-technology interconnect antenna, mechanism solutions that have value to the end user and thereby have value to our customers who are thereby willing to pay us a certain price for them. And we can then make the returns that we'd like to make. And so as we've seen the real proliferation of a wide variety of these new platforms, we're very fortunate that we have in Amphenol a team that is so responsive to the needs of that market that they're able to capitalize on the growth wherever that may come. And that includes getting a broad position on a variety of different products that are being released and are now starting to ramp up.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Diana?","Diana G. Reardon","Sure. I mean, I think that, Jim, we have some mix of product in our cable business. As you know, the preponderance of the product is going to the broadband market but in some of the international markets, we also offer products that go more broadly and are used, I would say, more in the communications infrastructure buildouts in places like South America and those kinds of markets. And I think there will -- we saw this quarter versus the demand we experienced last year's quarter and last quarter was -- just a lower consumption of those types of products. And these are the types of items we refer to when we use the \"specialty\" word. This is to distinguish it between the broadband products which make up the bigger part of the segment.","R. Adam Norwitt","I mean, you know and we have talked about in the past that we have -- over many years have been driving to diversify the technology portfolio of products that we have in our cable business, and that is something where we have been very successful. And I think, as Diana mentioned in her remarks, in this quarter, certainly there were some impacts on some of that product mix in the short term. But we still feel very optimistic about all those efforts, going forward, and we continue to create excellent new products. And when you combine that with now the Holland acquisition in the true broadband market, which not only gives us a broader range of complementary products but also allows us to expand what had been a more narrow range of traditional cable operator customers, we feel very, very good about that market going forward. And we think that the acquisition is going to create a great platform for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I have a question and a follow-up as well. Maybe to start off on the inventory: It was up 5%. Can you just maybe talk about how much of that was due to acquisitions versus some of the other factors? And I'm sort of looking at the organic guide of revenue, if you may, being down 1.5% versus inventory up 5%. It kind of gives you -- it makes x [ph] acquisition. Or was there just some level of conservatism [ph] built into the guide, or did you actually have a slow finish to the September quarter?","Diana G. Reardon","All right, sure. Just starting off with the inventory question, I -- what -- the increase in inventory, without the acquisition impact, probably would have been more comparable to the sequential sales change, Amit. If you look at the turnover, which we compute without the acquisition impact, inventory days remained about the same level. I would also just add that the mobile device market, which as you know had a large sequential growth in the third quarter and will have some further sequential growth in the fourth quarter, tends to run fairly low from an inventory days perspective, so they do have to build inventory as they feed those higher sales levels. And I think those are the 2 things that have contributed to the inventory number in terms of the absolute amount you see on the balance sheet. From a guidance perspective in terms of the sequential change between Q3 and Q4, we're guiding to a slight increase in sales in terms from a U.S. dollar perspective. At the high end, it's probably about 1% down from an organic perspective, which I think is the change that you asked about. I think that Adam went through the individual markets. It's a relatively small change in guidance versus what was implied at the guidance we gave when we released earnings for the third quarter. And that change primarily is due to, I think, some softer demand in the communications equipments market, primarily in the IT Datacom market. But we feel that this is a very strong guidance particularly in kind of the mixed demand environment that we see here in Q4. So we feel that it's appropriate guidance, and it's based on the same process that we go through internally with all of our units each quarter.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's really helpful. And maybe we'll just ask Adam a question: The M&A environment, in the case on all the deals you guys have been able to do this year, it's been an extremely good year for you guys. If you can maybe just step back and talk about what do you think was the driver for a better M&A year, at least so far in 2012? And do you think that's something that can sustain in the future, especially the U.S., if the risk of the taxes and capital gain taxes are going to go higher?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes, thank you very much, Amit. It's excellent question. It has been a great year for us. I mean, we have completed so far this year 4 acquisitions. They've been in a wide variety of markets. They've bolstered our broadband market, commercial air, automotive, industrial markets. So these have been just outstanding acquisitions, and we're very proud of that track record this year as well as the long-term track record. The thing is, to say that it's been a great year is very true. We have always said that we've never been able to predict how many deals are going to close, when they're going to close, what the timing of that is going to be. And I continue to say the same thing. Yes, there are in the U.S. certain tax considerations, but that has not been the real driver for why we've been able to be successful this year. We have an outstanding organization around the world, really planting seeds of relationships and incubating these acquisitions over a very long time period. It just so happens that yes, we have 4 of them this year. We still have a very strong pipeline of acquisitions irregardless of what pages of the calendar turn and irregardless of what tax laws are going to change. And we still feel optimistic and hopeful that we'll continue to have strong contribution from our acquisitions, going forward. Acquisitions, we always have that goal, that they would represent roughly 1\/3 of our growth in any given year. Obviously some years it is more, some years it is less. This year, they have to have a good contribution. And we believe that the track record for acquisitions that we have created over more than a decade has really allowed us to go to companies with a very consistent and credible story that they can join Amphenol, together with their organizations, and they will be able to flourish within Amphenol but not to disappear and not to be kind of absorbed into this sort of global entity, but rather to take the best of what they have and to create new platforms for growth with them. That is an extremely compelling story when you're talking to entrepreneurs in any geography, in any tax regime, with any president in office; that is a compelling story. So we believe that going forward, that will continue to be compelling and we'll continue to have a good acquisition pipeline.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","First question on margins, for Diana. Obviously, good operating margin in the quarter, but gross margin was down about 30 basis points. Was that primarily a function of mix? Or was there anything else, such as input costs or any pricing mix or pricing pressures?","Diana G. Reardon","Sure. Let me just first say that we were really pleased with the company's profitability achievement in the quarter to be able to get to 19.5% operating income margins. We're about 3 quarters of the way through the year and so far, we've got 3 consecutive quarters of margin expansion. And so I think that our operating team is really proud of being able to accomplish that. If we talk about the components of where that ROS expansion comes from, I think as we've described before, we really all manage the business to expand the operating profit line. And we think this approach is really necessary and it's the only way you get all of the team to focus on every cost that hits the P&L irrespective of what line it shows up on. If we look at SG&A specifically, we certainly do a very good job at controlling these costs and do try to limit the SG&A growth to about 1\/2 sales growth. And if you look at SG&A on a year-over-year basis, our SG&A grew about 3% over last year on a 7% or so increase in sales. So the movement in SG&A was pretty consistent with this objective that we set for the company. If you look sequentially, I think you see what you describe, which is a reduction in SG&A and some reduction in margin which aggregates at the end of the day to the improvement in ROS that we saw. And I think this, from a quarter-to-quarter basis, there is some impact from mix to the extent that they -- really, all of that sequential sales growth came from our mobile device mark -- device market. And that business does carry a lower SG&A level and this is balanced against a somewhat lower gross margin level. Now this is a very competitive business, and in order to achieve the operating income that we target for the business, we're able to manage that SG&A down and therefore have no effect on operating income at the end of the day. And I think that that's what you see when you look sequentially. We do have quite a mix of between gross margin and SG&A depending on the particular market and the particular product. This current SG&A level of 11.7% of sales certainly reflects a very strong ongoing management of spending. But I think over the long term, we would still continue to expect SG&A to grow in a somewhat lower pace than sales. We've historically operated with a very efficient and low level of SG&A. We're still able to drive excellent new product development, technology expansion and sales growth. And we would expect this dynamic to continue in the future.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And Adam, just a bigger picture for you that ties into your commentary on M&A and the fact that you're continuing to operate on this entrepreneurial structure. As you continue to do acquisitions, I think you're looking at 60-plus operating units throughout the company. Is it getting more difficult to manage those operations, particularly that you don't have any integrated IT system? And are there any plans to look at any sort of changes into the way you control or manage the business as it gets bigger?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes, Matt, thanks very much for the question. Let me answer a couple of very simple answers to you. Number one, does it get more difficult? No, it actually becomes more powerful in that our organizational structures such that I don't have 80 direct reports to me. It's 80, 85 operating units. Those report into group executives who run strategic portions of our business, and each of those general managers that come in as an acquisition or come in organically, they're reporting to one of those group executives. And they're driving aligned strategies around a product or around a market mission. And the management of those is not complicated when we bring them in. It's actually quite simple because at the core of Amphenol is that we vest the authority in these general managers, and we hold them accountable to run their business. And then we seek, through the group executives and through us here at headquarters, to find ways for them to collaborate. We call it collaborative entrepreneur. And that has been a tremendous, tremendous structure for us, and it's one that is inherently extremely scalable. Now relative to your question about IT, very simple, the answer is no. We have no intention to make a kind of an overall IT revamp of Amphenol. We actually feel extremely comfortable that each of our organizations is in a way tailor made to the market that they serve. So if you were running a company that is, say, a military operation, you need a very different system than one that is focused in the mobile market. The life cycles are different. The level of interaction and control is different. The level of tracking requirements is different. You name it. And to apply a kind of a one-size-fits-all blanket IT solution to the whole company is something that we would see as actually being detrimental to the growth prospects of Amphenol. And in a way as well, from a control standpoint, there's no greater level of control that we have as not having that sort of single point of failure within a system. And so we believe that, that organizational structure which is so core to the success of the company so far and has allowed the company to scale over the last decade by a factor of 4, has inherently tremendous more scalability built into it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Adam, you alluded to some ramp of new programs in the defense end market, and I was wondering are these programs geared towards international customers. And secondly, we started to see some of the defense companies start to bake in the impact of sequestration into their formal guidance. What are your thoughts and expectations around this? Do you think there is any chance of it getting implemented in its current form? And do you still see a path towards your own defense revenues of flat to up in such an environment?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes. Thanks very much, Wamsi. I mean, relative to what we see in the near term, we continue to see and we have seen that the military and the contractors to the military are working on next-generation programs. And we have seen that some of those programs are beginning to ramp here in the fourth quarter, and those are really programs surrounding new avionic systems, new missile systems, radar systems where there are just the tremendous amount of new electronics and innovation that goes into those systems. And so the fact that we have really the broadest portfolio of products in the military, everything from the traditional harsh environment connectors to RF to fiber optics and you name it, means that we are participating very strongly wherever the military is implementing electronics. And so there is, to that extent, for us a great benefit, as some of those new programs ramp up with the new electronics. Relative to sequestration, look, I mean, we are not here to guess which way politicians are going to vote thumbs up or thumbs down on sequestration. I believe personally that it would be not the wisest thing for the government to allow sequestration to go through considering that there are a tremendous number of jobs related to the military market, and they are some of the best jobs that exist in the United States today. Is that baked into our guidance in the fourth quarter? Certainly, we have not assumed in the fourth quarter any massive drop-off in spending, and that's not where sequestration would be. If it comes, we'll deal with it. We have dealt with changes in the market environment in the past. What we know very clearly, though, is whether that is sequestration or not, there's going to be a demand by the military to still perform the mission that they got to perform. And one of the best ways that they see towards doing that is by implementing new electronics. And I think that some of these new programs that we've seen are in fact just doing that, bringing in electronics to save operating expenses for the military in the future. And I think to that extent that the military continues to face up to that mission, which I think they will do, there's no doubt about it. The electronics is going to have the potential for us to continue to support that market. It's not as our strongest growing market, but a market where we believe there's still further potential for expansion in the future.","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And, Diana, a quick follow-up to your comments on SG&A from before. On a sequential basis, SG&A was pretty flat despite a $40 million sort of increase quarter-over-quarter in revenues. As we look forward here, at what -- is there a revenue -- a certain revenue level that you can support with this current SG&A structure? And when should we sort of think of that increasing at a stronger pace than what we just saw this past quarter?","Diana G. Reardon","Yes, I mean, I think we don't have, Wamsi, really a specific consolidated revenue level that, that certain SG&A would support. I think as I said, we have a very cost structure by business depending on the market they serve, depending on the gross margins that the products are able to achieve and so forth. I think what we saw in the third quarter, as I said, all our sequential growth came in the mobile device market, which by its nature, it's competitive nature, it does have lower gross margins and lower SG&A. And so to support that sales growth, it's really not a lot of investment in SG&A that's required. So it really depends upon where that sales growth comes from. I think as a rule of thumb, the rule of thumb that we use on a consolidated basis is we expect -- we would expect SG&A to grow less than half of what sales growth is, and so I think from a modeling perspective, I think this rule of thumb is what I would use.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Two questions, just first off, on the auto-related commentary being the market maybe easing a bit in Europe, is that just are you seeing actual production cuts from your customers? Or you're just seeing kind of a leveling off in the growth rate maybe in Europe and just automotive overall? And then the second question is, Diana, just commodities, we've seen a little bit of a rally here in both copper and gold prices. Are they getting to a point where they're becoming a bit cumbersome in terms of margins? Or are you at least able to manage through that right now?","R. Adam Norwitt","Very good, Shawn, thank you very much. I mean with respect to the automotive market, there's no secret that there are some economic challenges going on in Europe. And I think we -- you had seen or we had seen that some of the automakers had already started talking about an impact to that early on even in prior quarters. And we have just seen in general, across really the first tier, and that's where we generally operate. We're not always selling our product directly to vehicle manufacturers, but rather to the first tier, that there is a little bit more conservatism surrounding their production schedules in light of the fact that they believe that there is maybe more a leveling of the automotive production as opposed to necessarily a big drop-off. I don't know that there is any big drop-off of that, but it appears to just be some degree of moderation. Normally in the fourth quarter, we would have expected to have seasonally an increase on a sequential basis in automotive. And I think the fact that we see that market essentially being flat with the third quarter is a reflection of some degree of moderation at some level in the supply chain. I don't believe that, that is necessarily a permanent issue, a severe issue. How long that will be, how long it will take the supply chain to work that out, that remains to be seen. But it's something that I think from a standpoint of being prudent in our outlook, we are seeing some of those signs and have reflected that in the guidance.","Diana G. Reardon","From a margin perspective and the recent news in commodities, I mean they certainly have come up some this past quarter. Certainly, it is something that we keep a very close eye on. It does obviously put some pressure on costs. I think at current levels in the current quarter, we've been able to manage through this. I think we continue to devote a lot of engineering resources to reducing our dependence on certain of the commodities that just seem, over the last few years, to have become -- have sort of a volatility that doesn't necessarily relate purely to manufacturing demand, gold, probably being the one that comes most in line. And so we continue to try to be very thoughtful and devote resources to using less of them. And I think that this is an important action for us. We also obviously look to try to consider the movements of the commodities when we're making pricing decisions but pricing, as you know, is also influenced by competitive issues as well as cost trends. I think at this point, where commodities stay at the same level that they're at, I don't think we would be concerned about meeting the margin goals that you see us being able to achieve in the third quarter and being reflected in our Q4 guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Diana, I just wanted to dig into the operating margin. It looks like for the December quarter at midpoint of guidance suggests that operating margins decline a little bit despite a flat revenue guide. Is that primarily related to the mix? Is that some pricing pressures that the growth of the mobile devices segment? Just wanted to understand that a little bit.","Diana G. Reardon","Sure. I mean, I think the way that we look at the guidance that we would expect operating margins to be about flat. There is some slight increase in sales at the high end of guidance, but it's relatively small primarily from the acquisitions that we made during the third quarter, which in aggregate probably have a profitability little less slightly below what the average of the company would be. But I think we would see them, Sherri, more as flat than as down.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, Adam, just thinking about the growth of the connector market overall, what do you see the growth of the connector market as being this year? And what are your expectations for the growth of the overall connector market next year? And do you still expect to be able to grow 2x that?","R. Adam Norwitt","Thanks very much, Sherri. That is as good as a guess by me as it is of anyone. I think we read the same reports that you all read. If you look at the kind of more credible connector market forecast for 2012, that would imply that this year will be a down year in the connector market. And I think if you look at our guidance for full year to be up essentially 8%, I would say that, that is clear outperformance in 2012 with respect to how the market has performed. What will it be in 2013? We're not giving guidance today to 2013. I don't know what the forecasts are for 2013. I mean when you look at all the uncertainties that is around today, the global economies and the various markets, I think at this point to talk about what the market increase will be in 2013 is really premature. Do we have confidence that we will outperform the market in 2013? Absolutely, and that has been a long track record for us for more than a dozen years, where we have been able to outperform the market on average by more than twice the rate of the growth. And this year is really no different than that. And we continue to believe that our unique combination of that entrepreneurial management structure that is so dynamic in all time periods, being able to react quickly in times of change, to capitalize on the available opportunities that are there because of this proliferation of electronics, combined with our high-technology and that just excellent position we have with customers around the world just creates for us a tremendous opportunity to outperform the industry in any economic environment. And look, it is today uncertain. It may be next year uncertain. But regardless of what that uncertainty is, one thing is for sure, which is that Amphenol is going to perform well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Kure with KeyBanc.","Anthony C. Kure - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just 2 quick ones. First, could you just talk about by end market, which ones are more weighted toward China? And then along those lines, how the quarter may have progressed month-to-month within that region, if you saw any discernible pattern?","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure, thanks very much. It is not surprising that you can imagine that some of the markets which are in mobile devices, IT data com, wireless infrastructure, those tend to be more Chinese related because that's where our customers make a lot of their stuff. And so those tend to be where we are shipping the vast majority of products in those markets into Asia. Whether that is all China, obviously, China is the biggest manufacturing spot in Asia, so that would certainly be significant. In other markets, military in particular, obviously we have essentially no sales in that market, and industrial and aerospace also would be less. Relative to how the quarter progressed, not surprisingly with the European vacations that the end of the quarter was stronger than the beginning of the quarter in terms of sales. I think in China, this was probably about the same, if not a little more balanced. You have in China the October holidays, so I would anticipate that in Q4, the beginning of the fourth quarter in China would probably be a little bit lighter than the end of the fourth quarter.","Anthony C. Kure - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then if you could just remind me how your automotive markets break down geographically? Is there particular waiting to one region?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes. I mean our automotive market is just under 2\/3 in Europe, so we have a higher preponderance of position with the high-end automakers in Europe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I had a question and a follow-up. Adam, we've heard a few more companies increasingly talk about higher levels of softness in the North American market. I'd be curious to see or hear what you're seeing or hearing from your customers there. And then as my follow-up, I just wanted to maybe dig in deeper into your wireless infrastructure segment. Wanted to see where the strength came from. Was it more related to your base station connector products? Was it antennas? And how you see the spending environment across geographies for that market?","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure, thank you very much, Amitabh. With respect to North America, we have read also many of the reports about the softening in North America. I can tell you actually in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis, North America was actually quite strong for us. It was one of our fastest growing -- it was actually our fastest-growing territory. From a sequential basis, it was as is usual in the third quarter. It was kind of flattish with -- compared to the second quarter. So I wouldn't say that we've necessarily seen such a dramatic slowdown in North America. Now with regard to wireless infrastructure, I mentioned that we're very pleased that we now have 3 quarters in a row of sequential growth. All that being said, it is still down on a year-over-year basis, albeit down by less than it has been over the prior quarters. And we look forward to the next quarter to having our first quarter in several where we'll actually grow quite significantly on a year-over-year basis. And the strength this quarter, on a sequential basis, probably came a bit more from our relationships with operators than it did with OEMs. But our position on both sides continues to strengthen. We continue to have a great position vis-\u00e0-vis the set of higher technology products that are going on the next-generation base stations. One thing that has happened to this market is the total structure of the base stations has completely changed over the course of the last 24 months. They've gone from the large-scale base stations to now these more remote access, small, up-the-tower kind of base stations. And as that happened, the type of interconnect technology that's required to be used to allow those products to survive in the harsh environment or to extend fiber optics or to have a different power structure has really dramatically changed. And our engineers have been working with the OEMs around the world to make sure that we take a leadership position on many of those technologies such that as those new base station platforms grow and as the new LTE rollouts happen on a worldwide basis, we will benefit from them. Similarly, we've done the same with our antenna business, where we put a lot of focus on developing next-generation products. You've seen some operators in certain geographies already launching these networks, and we're fortunate to be present with some of those operators, and that's part of what has helped us in this quarter from a sequential standpoint. But going forward, to the extent that the industry slowly figures out the difficult economics that allows them to make further investments and essentially allows them to charge their customers for data usage, we're in a very strong position to participate going forward.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. Adam, just a quick follow-up, was the strength mainly skewed towards North America? Or are you starting to see geographies staring to participate, particularly Asia Pac and Europe?","R. Adam Norwitt","I think in the third quarter, it's probably a bit more North America. I mean that's -- it is where the buildouts are happening. And the most significant buildouts, Amitabh, are happening in next-gen networks so far in the U.S. And again, I'm hopeful that others are coming close behind. The U.S. has the luxury of having the highest average revenue per user essentially of any economy, and so they have a little bit more money to invest than some of their brethren in less developed parts of the world.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Wherley with Janney Capital Markets.","Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Adam, I just want to follow up on that market and just to ask if you think that there is any chance that there might be a bigger bump-up in the rollout of those wireless networks in 2013. Or do you think it'll just sort of be scraping along like this with caution?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes. Look, I would not go out on a limb to say that there's going to be huge bump-ups in wireless infrastructure in 2013. Again, we're not giving guidance for 2013, and we're certainly -- as we get closer to that year, we'll reassess where we think the markets are going to go in that year. But this is a market that has gone through a lot of challenges. I mean you don't have to just look at us where we have 10% of our sales in that market. You look at the performance of the various OEMs in that market and you can tell. You have a situation where the operators are making lots of money, but the operators cannot justify making the real significant investments that all of us as consumers are dying for them to make. I mean you just drive around here in Connecticut or on the way to New York, and you all know how terrible is the coverage and how slow the data is even though we're talking about 4G. At least that's what it says on my phone is that it's 4G. And that need to make the investment is clearly there. Clearly there is a pent-up demand for that. But also what is clear is that the economics are not driving the operators to make those investments at the pace that they should be doing that. That's true here. That's true in Europe. That's true in Asia, in China. In particular it's true in places like India, where they're just not realizing the returns on their investments because of the low-level spending by individual users. So I think our strategy in this market continues to be to gain presence on both sides of the market, to gain it on the equipment, to gain it with the operators and to gain it in particular with high-technology products on next-generation system. Over time, that will work out. Is that going to be a spike in 2013 or 2014 or 2015? I think we'll know it when it comes.","Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up in both the industrial and auto segments or end markets, you had boost from acquisitions. Did either of those end markets grow year-over-year on an organic basis?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes, absolutely. Both of them did, actually. I mean industrial grew close to double digits on an organic basis, and automotive was sort of mid-single digits on an organic basis. So I think we're very, very pleased with the growth in both those markets consistently. Over the course of the last year, both have grown both by the additions of some excellent companies that we have acquired, but also through just tremendous organic efforts that our teams are making. I mean we have built, just to name a few in the industrial market, essentially the leading business in oil and gas and energy-related products. And we've done that certainly by making 1 or 2 acquisitions, but in particular, we've done that by spreading to customers around the world technologies that they need at the right time and in the right place. In automotive as well, we have capitalized organically on a real revolution of electronics and cars where things that used to be just mere electrical interconnect where there was not the value for us have become electronic, controlled with sensors and processors, whereby you have to put in the interconnect systems more functionality and place that in a harsher environment section of the car. And that's where you can create value. And so our organic efforts in automotive have been very focused around tapping into that revolution in higher value potential interconnect technologies. We've done that through bringing in some new companies, but we've done that also organically through our own efforts of people who have been with the company for many decades.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Goldman Sachs.","Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Adam, if you exclude the impacts from acquisitions as well as the growth you're seeing in the mobile device segment, it still looks like you're performing really well relative to some of the data points through the supply chain and from an in-demand perspective. So any other things you can point at from an end market perspective or specific new products or designs would be helpful.","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes. Well, appreciate that, Craig, and we would agree with your analysis. I think I mentioned it early on in my prepared remarks. There is one asset that this company has which you should just never -- you should never minimize the importance of, and that is the diversification. We view diversification not just as something to make a pie chart to show to investors. It is really a way of going about our business on a day-to-day basis. When we sit with our operating units, we are constantly asking them the question, \"You have that business. Why do you not have it with the competition? Why do not have the other connector on that application? Why do you not have that other application that is made also in that market?\" And that constant drive to diversify the business in markets, in customers within those markets, in applications within those customers and in products within those applications, that has been an ongoing drive for more than a decade and a half. And the net result of that is that we have excellent positions across all the markets that we serve. And so when you look at our performance on a year-over-year basis, the strength that came in commercial aero growing 18% year-over-year, strength in industrial growing 23% or close to 10% organically, automotive strength, even IT & Datacom. We talked about the fact that there is -- we have seen a clear moderation of demand in IT & Datacom in the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we grew in that market by 5%, totally organic growth in a market where essentially none of the customers are growing by any rate at all. I mean, there have been recent earnings announcements just in recent hours, which confirm that growing 5% in that market means you are clearly taking more position in the market than just rising or falling with the tide. And that constant quest to drive diversification, to make sure we're bringing the greatest technologies to our customers in each of those markets, that in the end, which is what has allowed us to outperform the market in good times and in bad. And we feel very good about these results in the third quarter. We feel very good about the outlook that we have in the fourth quarter because it is a time of tremendous uncertainty. And I would tell you that during the course of the third quarter, that uncertainty, the level of that uncertainty at least appeared to us to increase. And that's \u2013 obviously, you read the papers enough. You feel very anxious every night when you go to bed. But the fact is even in that -- amidst that environment of increasing uncertainty, we still are able to grow. We're still able to grow in a wide variety of markets and still able to realize the value from that diversification that we spent so long to create.","Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","If I can follow up just more specific to the mobile devices, can you talk about the type of visibility you have in that market? And then also touch on just the diversification of different devices would be helpful.","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure, I mean the visibility in that market is obviously much less than it is in some of the more longer cycle markets. I mean you can imagine we're not getting 16-week lead times or even 8-week lead times. I mean some of the things that we have to do in that market would really make you quite amazed at the things that our team has to do to react to that market because sometimes you're just getting an email or a phone call from a customer in the middle of the night saying, \"I need you to double your capacity by next Friday.\" And these are not demands that you get that seem at all reasonable. And it's a question of can you do that. Can you exercise your organization in a real accordion-like fashion to capitalize on the upside that the customers bring and then to react when that goes down the other way? I mean that's something that our team has really developed a real expertise in doing. Relative to do we have visibility in that market going into the fourth quarter, we have given guidance here that we believe that, that market will still show some moderate sequential uptick, and just us we did last quarter, we based that guidance on what our customers tell us and our own assessment of that. And we feel comfortable with that guidance. Now where is it coming from? You asked some color on that. With -- obviously, I'm not going to get specific about individual customers or programs, but let's just let it be said that we have always had a strategy to gain position on as many products as we can and not try to go out and pick who's going to be the winner or the loser in the marketplace. And in this case we continue to do that, and we have a great position on a variety of what I term mobile computing devices going forward. And these can be tablets. They can be ultrabooks. You name it. There's a wide variety of these things that I mentioned earlier.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research.","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","Just a couple of questions. First, I guess the only market you haven't really covered in a little more detail is industrial. Adam, since you seemed to mention that the economy is impacting demand somewhat there, can you sort of parcel that out a little bit where you're seeing better growth and worse growth since there are so many different submarkets? And then just a clarification, Diana, can you just let us know exactly when the 2 acquisitions close? And is the Broadband acquisition, the Griffith acquisition -- or I'm sorry, the Holland acquisition, is that actually going into the cables segment that you report each quarter?","Diana G. Reardon","Sure, Steven. We got to start with that one because that's -- we closed the smaller of the 2 acquisitions in somewhere around mid-August and closed the larger, the Holland acquisition, at the very end of the quarter. And you are correct that, that the Holland acquisition will actually go into the cable segment from a reporting perspective because we will run certainly the 2 businesses from a strategic standpoint under the umbrella of the cable group in that broadband market. And I think Adam described why we're excited about that and what potential that will bring for the company for growth.","R. Adam Norwitt","And, Steve, just with respect to industrial market, I think I mentioned earlier on that the strength that we saw in the third quarter really came from the energy-related segments: oil and gas, alternative energy, as well as some degree of strength in the factory automation market. Going forward, where do we see that sort of macroeconomic impact that allowed -- that makes us think that maybe that market will be kind of more flat than what it would normally be, which is seasonally up in the fourth quarter? We have seen signs in Europe, for example, that there's some moderation among some of our customers in terms of what amount of product they want to pull, really more in the near-term. In addition, there also appears to be in some of the oil and gas markets that there is also some degree of seasonality in the fourth quarter that comes from not wanting to do certain things when it's extremely called out. So that's -- in general, we feel very, very good about that market going forward heading into next year. We continue to believe that the industrial market will be a market that will grow greater than the average of Amphenol over the near, medium and long term, as we just see so much electronics being pushed into new areas of the industrial market. I mean just to call it industrial is almost so general because there\u2019s so many segments in there: rail mass transit, heavy equipment, medical, instrumentation, all the energy-related things that the automation, the machine tool lighting. You name it. I mean there's just so many exciting things happening across all of those markets. That gives us real great confidence in the future performance of the industrial market.","Operator","Our final question comes from Brian White with Topeka.","Brian John White - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","When you look at the IT and data market in the December quarter, how can we parse out the computing portion of that storage and servers compared to the networking and expectations for the fourth quarter?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes, I mean I think what I can tell you just relative to the third quarter first, Brian, is the strength that we saw in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis was more driven by servers than it was by networking. With respect to the fourth quarter, it's hard to get so granular about how that outlook is. I would just tell you that we see just more of a general moderation in terms of the willingness of end IT customers to spend as much money as they normally do. I mean people have talked in years past about this kind of \"year-end budget flush\" among IT managers, and at least, we have not seen clear signs that such a year-end budget flush is going to happen as significantly in 2012 given all the uncertainties that are around today. And I would think that that's equally true, whether you're talking about server, storage or networking. But look, there are many OEMs who are closer to it than we are that would be good to talk to.","Brian John White - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Do you see a lot of innovation in new products in these markets in IT and data? Or has that also stopped?","R. Adam Norwitt","No, I mean I would tell you that the innovation has accelerated. I mean this year, the number of new programs that we have been working on is really almost, I would say, unequaled in at least in recent memory. And that is all driven by just that simple fact that the networks just got to do more with less. They are cranking so much data out predominantly because of video that the -- our customers who are really competing neck and neck in the marketplace are trying to develop machines and equipment that has greater functionality to process all of this data, and so they're continuing just tremendous, tremendous initiatives that are ongoing. Some of these are extremely long-term initiatives. What you wouldn't say is going to support sales in the fourth quarter even in the first quarter, some of those are more near term. What is clear around all of them is there are 2 paramount concerns by our customers. One is they got to get more data through the system, and  two is they got to use less power doing so. And our excellent products on both those fronts are really finding great reception by all the customers.","Brian John White - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And that is across both networking and the computing side of the IT and data?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes. I mean it's really across the board. I mean we deal with the server, storage and networking, all of the above.","Well at this time, I think there are no further questions and once again, we\u2019d like to thank all of you for your time and attention today. And since we won't have the chance to speak to you until next year, wish you a great year end and holiday season, and we'll talk to you in 2013. Thank you very much.","Diana G. Reardon","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for joining today's conference. That does conclude the call at this time.

[Operator Instructions] At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Ms. Diana Reardon. Ma'am, you may begin.","Diana G. Reardon","Thank you. My name is Diana Reardon, and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we'd like to welcome you all to our first quarter call. Q1 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question-and-answer session.","The company closed the first quarter achieving sales of $982 million and EPS of $0.77, hitting the high end of the company's guidance. Sales were up 4% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currencies compared to Q1 of 2011. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and foreign exchange, sales in Q1 2012 were about the same as last year. Sequentially, sales were up 3% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically from Q4. ","Breaking down sales into our 2 major components, our Cable business which comprised 7% of our sales, was up 17% from last year and 20% from last quarter. The Interconnect business was comprised 93% of our sales, was up 3% from last year and 2% sequentially. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. ","Operating income for the quarter was $185 million compared to $186 million last year. Operating margin was 18.9% in Q1 2012, up from 18.5% in Q4, a strong sequential conversion margin of approximately 30% from Q4. Q1 2012 ROS of 18.9% compares to a very strong Q1 2011 ROS of 19.8%. Year-over-year reduction in Q1 is mainly attributable to lower margins in our Interconnect business which were 21% in the quarter compared to 22.1% last year. This was partially offset by an improvement in the margin in our Cable business from 11.8% last year to 14.5% in the most recent quarter. Reduction in Interconnect margin relates primarily to the impact of increases in material input costs versus the prior year, particularly for precious metals and plastics. These impacts were partially offset by the positive impact of cost reduction. ","From a sequential standpoint, operating margins improved 40 basis points to 18.9%. This margin improvement relates to good margin expansion on incremental volume in both the Interconnect and Cable businesses with Interconnect margins increasing 20 basis points to 21% and Cable margins increasing 140 basis points to 14.5%. In addition, corporate expenses were essentially flat on higher sales contributing 10 basis points to overall operating margin improvement. We are very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement this quarter. 2012 has began with a more balanced operating environment from a cost inflation and demand perspective, and in that more normal environment, the management team has achieved strong sequential improvement in margins and remains fully committed to further margin expansion as business volumes grow. ","Interest expense in the quarter was $13.7 million compared to $10 million last year, reflecting higher average debt levels from the company's stock buyback program and the higher interest expense associated with the company's January senior notes offering. Other income was $2.2 million in the quarter, up from $1.7 million last year, primarily as a result of higher interest income on higher levels of cash and short-term cash investment. The company's effective tax rate in the quarter was 26.8% compared to a rate of 27.5% from the first quarter of last year. For the full year 2011, excluding onetime items, the company's effective tax rate was 26.8%, and we currently expect a similar tax rate for the full year 2012. ","Net income was approximately 13% of sales in Q1, a very strong performance. Orders in the quarter were $1,028,000,000, up 7% from last year, resulting in the book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.05:1. In April of this year, the company completed the acquisition of Nelson-Dunn, a U.S. manufacturer of high-technology value-added interconnect assemblies for the oil and gas market with annual sales of approximately $45 million. This acquisition complements and strengthens the company's offering of harsh environment products for the fast-growing energy markets. The company paid approximately $55 million for the company. ","We continue to be excellent generators of cash. Cash flow from operations was $164 million in the quarter, approximately 130% of net income, and we continue to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory was at $659 million at the end of March, up 1% over the December quarter. Inventory days declined 1 day to 88 days. ","Accounts receivable was $771 million at the end of March, and day sales outstanding fell 2 days at the end of the quarter. Accounts payable was $403 million at the end of March, and from a day\u2019s perspective, improved to 1 day at the end of the quarter. ","At the beginning of 2012, the company issued $500 million of senior notes due 2022. Notes were sold at a slight discount and carry a 4% coupon. Proceeds from the notes were used to repay borrowings under the company's revolving credit facility, which matures in 2016. At the end of the quarter, borrowings and availability under the facility were $216 million and $784 million, respectively. The note issuance has a number of benefits for the company including the extension and staggering of the company's debt maturity schedule, the continued expansion of the company's investor base and an increase in the company's availability and liquidity. From the basis of the new debt structure, the company expects Q2 interest expense to be up slightly from Q1 levels.","Our cash flow from operations of $164 million along with net proceeds from the notes sale of $494 million, cash and short-term investments of $12 million, and $28 million of option proceeds rate were used primarily for repayment of $481 million of borrowings under the company's revolving credit and receivables facilities, net capital expenditures of $32 million, the purchase of approximately 1.5 million shares of the company's stock for $82 million, dividend payments of $2 million and an increase in cash of $106 million. ","At the end of the quarter, the company had approximately 5.1 million shares remaining for purchase under the 20 million share buyback program that expires in January 2014. At the end of March, cash and short-term investments stood at $743 million, the majority of which is held outside the U.S. ","Total debt was $1.4 billion, bringing net debt to approximately $652 million at the end of March. Company's leverage and interest coverage ratios remain very strong at the end of the quarter at 1.5 and 20x, respectively. And our EBITDA in the quarter was about $224 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter. ","Before I turn the call over to Adam, I wanted to give you an update on our progress in the flood recovery at our Sidney, New York facility. As we have previously discussed, the company, together with state and local government is in the process of constructing a new facility in the local area outside of the flood zone to house the majority of the company's Sidney manufacturing activities. We expect the construction progress to take approximately 18 to 24 months and require an investment by the company of approximately $40 million to $50 million, offset by government incentives of approximately $25 million to $35 million, for a net investment of approximately $60 million. A portion of the government incentives will be paid out to the company over an 8- to 10-year time period. The company has full support of its customers for the move and does not anticipate any business disruption as a result. Relative to sales, we experienced no disruption in manufacturing activity or sales in the first quarter of 2012, and continue to expect the full recovery of approximately $18 million or so in lost sales as we go through this year. ","Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends.","R. Adam Norwitt","Thank you very much, Diana, and I'd like to extend my welcome to all of you here on the phone today. I'm going to spend a couple of minutes to highlight some of our achievements in the first quarter that are notable for my perspective, then I'm going to discuss some of our trends and progress in our served markets, and then finally, I'll comment on the company's outlook for the second quarter and the full year 2012. ","I'm very pleased to report results in the first quarter above the high end of our guidance, despite continuing uncertainties in the global economic environment. As Diana mentioned, revenues increased 4% from prior year and 3% sequentially. Importantly, orders in the quarter reached a new record, $1,028,000,000, representing a 1.05 book-to-bill, certainly creating confidence for the future. ","We find it especially rewarding that our management team's intense focus on managing all elements of profitability led to stronger sequential conversion margins and resulted in our operating margins expanding to 18.9% in the first quarter. I'm very proud of the agile and entrepreneurial Amphenol organization. All of them are capitalizing on the many opportunities created by the revolution in electronics and are continuing to demonstrate the strength and discipline necessary to drive strong operating performance for the company. In addition, we're very excited that our acquisition program continued to create significant value for the company. ","As Diana mentioned, in early April, we completed the acquisition of Nelson-Dunn. Nelson-Dunn is a U.S.-based manufacturer of high-technology value-add interconnect products for the oil and gas market with annual sales of approximately $45 million. This important acquisition builds upon our industry-leading offering of products to oil and gas exploration and drilling customers, allowing us to offer total interconnect solutions to this important and dynamic market. This is a market where Amphenol has very clear leadership position in the interconnect industry. It's also consistent, this acquisition, with our ongoing and successful strategy to acquire complementary companies, strong management, leading technologies and excellent market presence. As we welcome the strong new team to Amphenol, we remain very confident that our successful acquisition program will continue to be a great contributor to Amphenol in the future. ","Turning to the trends and progress in our served markets. Once again, our results in the first quarter confirmed that the end market diversification of Amphenol is a tremendous asset for the company. First, the military market represented 15% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in that market declined by 9% from prior year on continued conservatism by defense customers. It increased by 5% sequentially as customer demand stabilized and as our flood recovery efforts were completed. While there is still some uncertainty in the defense budgets of many developed economies, we are actually very encouraged to be seeing many clear indications of expanding investments in new electronic functionalities in military equipment. We expect demand in the military market to strengthen further in the second quarter, and we believe that the increase in military electronics is a real opportunity for continued long-term growth in this important market. ","Commercial aerospace market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter and sales increased a very strong 27% from prior year and 15% sequentially, an increased jet liner production, as well as growing content on new airliner platforms. We continue to be encouraged by the technology transition that is occurring in the commercial air market. New airplanes are adopting innovative electronic features and are incorporating, in particular, new hire technology interconnect solutions to enhance fuel efficiency. ","Looking forward, we expect stable sales at these higher levels in the second quarter, and we continue to have a positive outlook for this market in 2012. ","Our sales into the industrial market represented 12% of total company in the first quarter, and sales increased 9% from prior year, as well as 9% sequentially, on stronger demand across most areas of this market. We continue, as a company, to make excellent progress, broadening our technology offering and increasing our penetration of many exciting growth segments of the industrial market including, in particular, alternative energy, oil and gas, heavy equipment and factory automation. ","In particular, we are very excited anticipate strong momentum in the oil and gas segment with the addition of Nelson-Dunn. We expect the overall industrial market to strengthen further in the second quarter as new interconnect technologies are adopted across a wide variety of applications and segments in this market. ","Our sales into the automotive market represented 12% of the company in the first quarter. Sales increased a very strong 66% from prior year and 27% sequentially, as we continue to benefit from an increase in vehicle production volumes and new electronics applications, together with a significant contributions from our recent automotive acquisition. ","We have been very successful in our drive to broaden the company's automotive product offering, both through internal technology developments and our continued focus on acquiring complementary companies in this market. In particular, we're very pleased that, that has resulted in the automotive market now representing 12% of our total sales in the first quarter. We expect demand to remain stable at these higher levels in the second quarter and look forward to continued long-term progress in this exciting market. ","The mobile devices market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. Sales decreased 5% from prior year, a stronger sales of products into new tablet computer platforms was more than offset by reductions in sales of mobile phone products due to dynamics in that segment. Sales declined 16% sequentially as expected on normal seasonality. We expect demand to strengthen from these levels in the second quarter and remain excited by our strong position in new smart mobile devices, in particular, tablet computers and the potential that these create in this year. We have a very strong technology position in this important end market due to our comprehensive portfolio of products for mobile devices, as well as our preferred supplier relationships with all major device makers. ","Mobile networks market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales decreased 21% from prior year but increased by 6% sequentially. Although wireless spending remains at lower-than-anticipated levels, we are encouraged by this recent uptick in demand as equipment makers are working through their over-inventory positions and as mobile operators resume spending on system upgrades and expansions. We expect demand in the mobile networks market to increase further in the second quarter as operators ramp up their network build-outs in order to relieve the pent-up demand for increased coverage and capacity, which exist on virtually all wireless networks. And we look forward to further long-term strength driven by our broad designing positions on the many new base station platforms, as well as by our strong position with the diverse range of global wireless operators. ","Information technology and data communications market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased 8% from prior year with strength in particular, in networking equipment and servers, and declined slightly from the fourth quarter on a continued moderation procurement activity by customers in this market. As our customers continue to strive for new levels of equipment performance in order to handle the dramatic expansion of data traffic that's ongoing, our pipeline of new design opportunities with our next-generation products has strengthened significantly. We believe that the recent pause in procurement activities should moderate going forward, leading to higher levels of demand in the second quarter as these next-generation systems are released to the market. ","Broadband market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter and sales in that market increased a very strong 14% from prior year and 19% sequentially, as we benefited from increased spending by cable operators, as well as from accelerating sales of new value-add products into both cable systems and head-in equipment. We're encouraged by our increasing position with new cable and interconnect products, as well as by our strong position in international markets. In particular, these high-technology products helped in part to support the increase in our cable margins to 14.5% in the first quarter. We expect demand to further improve in the second quarter and look forward to realizing the further benefits of our diversification efforts. ","In summary, with respect to the first quarter, I'm extremely proud of our organization as we continue to execute well in what is still a very challenging and, no doubt, dynamic market environment. In particular, we're pleased with the company's renewed expansion of our industry-leading margins, as well as our sustained financial strength. Amphenol's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing positions with customers across the diverse range of markets, our worldwide presence, truly lean and flexible cost structure and most importantly, an agile and entrepreneurial management team. ","Looking forward, based on constant exchange rates, as well as based on normal seasonal patterns, we now expect for our guidance in the second quarter, as well as for the full year of 2012 following results. We expect sales in the range of $1,040,000,000 to $1,055,000,000, and $4,105,000,000 to $4,190,000,000, respectively. We expect EPS in the range of $0.82 to $0.85 for the second quarter and $3.30 to $3.38 for the full year. ","For the full year, this guidance represents sales and earnings per share growth of 4% to 6%, and 8% to 11%, respectively. We're very encouraged by the strong outlook in sales and earnings especially given the many continuing uncertainties in the global economy. There is still an ongoing revolution in electronics, and that revolution continues to create many opportunities for Amphenol. I am confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to continue to capitalize on these opportunities and to grow our market position and expand the company's profitability and thereby, to drive the continued superior performance of Amphenol. ","Thank you very much. And operator, at this time, we'd be very happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Craig Hettenbach from Goldman Sachs.","Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Adam, can you touch on capital allocation? It looks like M&A is coming back a bit, but you're also buying back stock, you recently increased your dividends, so just an update on your overall approach there as you go forward?","Diana G. Reardon","Sure. Maybe I can take that one. I mean, I think that we clearly continue to feel that the company's financial strength is an important strategic advantage that lets us take -- really take advantage of opportunities that come along to deploy that strength as they present themselves. This bond deal that we did at the beginning of the year, I think, even further strengthened the company from a liquidity position perspective. As you know, we used most of that to pay down revolver borrowings. And so at the end of the quarter, we had about $1.5 billion of capacity between the cash and revolver availability, not to mention the strong operating cash flow that the company continues to generate. From a prioritization perspective and to get to your question, I think that we continue to prioritize the use of that financial strength, certainly towards our acquisition program. I mean, this, I think, we both believe that this remains the best strategic and return potential for the company. We closed the acquisition in April, that Adam just referred to, and we continue to see a lot of potential for acquisitions as the industry continues to consolidate. This continues to be a very important focus for the entire team. Last year, as you know, acquisitions contributed just shy of 1\/3 of our growth, and we expect to continue to have the program make a strong contribution in 2012 and beyond. In addition to prioritizing the financial strength for use in the acquisition program, we continue to view both stock buyback and dividend as good options to return value to shareholders. Last year, we bought about 13 million shares. In Q1, we bought about 1.5 million shares. We've got just over 5 million left on the current program, and we -- in addition to that increase, we proved an increase in dividend to just under 1% yield, I think, back in the fourth quarter at that time of the announcement. And so as we go along, I think on a quarter-to-quarter basis, we're going to be looking both to continue to fund the acquisition program, and I think you'll also see us look at stock buyback as a good option. We will also continue to reconsider the dividend level as we go along. And I think that you'll see us just deploy a very thoughtful and balanced approach to using the company's financial strength.","R. Adam Norwitt","Let me just also add, Craig, I mean, as much as this all come down to, you have heard many times, us refer to the agility of our management team. And no doubt about it, as Diana works, and I work together with drawing our capital structure, we also strive to have agility and flexibility, and importantly, relative to the acquisition program and we continue to see excellent opportunities in that program. We're very excited. In the last 2 quarters, each of those quarters, we've had a very nice acquisition in a real diverse array of market, and we still have, in our pipeline, great opportunities looking out into the future. It is the market, the interconnect market which naturally creates these great acquisition opportunities. And it is through that financial flexibly that we have, together with the organizational flexibility and the unique structure that we have that makes of those acquisitions so viable and create so much potential value for the company.","Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. If I could just ask one follow-up, Adam, just you commented on the record bookings and 1.05:1 book-to-bill. Can you talk about just the visibility that you're seeing from your customers today and maybe how that compares to recent months?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes. We're very excited by the bookings in the first quarter, and we had a positive book-to-bill in the fourth quarter as well, and that's really what gives us the confidence to have the strong sequential outlook looking into the second quarter. I wouldn't tell you necessarily that this ability has gotten noticeably better or worse compared to the fourth quarter or the third quarter, I think customers continue to be cautious. We see across all the markets still caution. I mean, every one of our markets, you hear every day about some sort of dynamic, let's put it that way, that is happening. And I think in such an environment where the macroeconomic environment is uncertain and where there continue to be internal dynamics to those markets, customers don't want to overextend themselves. So what does that mean for us as a company? It means that we got to just be reactive, and we got to have our operational excellence at such a pace that we can convert those orders in the short time that sometimes they're given to us. I would not tell you that the orders are due to customers just pulling out the lead time because they now feel very different than they did 3 months ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from Amitabh Passi from UBS.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Adam, my first question just had to do with a couple of your end markets. I think the first one on everybody's mind is an explosion at a chemical facility in Europe. Just wondering if you're hearing or seeing anything from your automotive supply chain, how concerned are you about this? And then just related -- or on the wireless infrastructure side, you talked about some strengthening late in the quarter. Just curious how broad-based that was or were they specific to any certain geographies?","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure. Well, with respect to this unfortunate explosion in Germany, we have not seen any impact to certainly our products. It's not -- the resin that was involved has nothing to do, we understand, with any of the connector or cable assembly products that we make. So we don't have any direct impact. What I understand is that some of the automotive OEMs, in particular, those outside of Europe are somewhat concerned about the availability but that the Europeans are not so concerned. And our product is predominantly sold into the European market. Europe is still the large portion of our automotive business. And we have not heard anything from any of our customers suggesting that this will have any significant ripple effect into our business at this point. Obviously, it's unfortunate. I think some people died in the explosion, and I know that the automakers are convening to try to find a quick solution here. Relative to wireless infrastructure, it is true. We saw some strengthening in the quarter, certainly from a sequential basis, even if it is still down quite significantly on a year-over-year basis. I think there was significant inventory positions that were built. We talked about this last quarter. Where the expectations of our customer going to the fourth quarter were just very different then, in the end, the demands from their operator customer. I think that is starting to work its way out. I think we've seen some of those benefits. And then we're starting to see the early signs, sort of the proverbial green shoot of the build outs of some of these next-generation networks in certain markets, and I think that is manifesting itself as well in that sequential performance. And we look forward to further sequential strength in that market even if still that is -- we're not happy where it is on a year-over-year basis.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then just as my follow-up, Adam, I was listening to a semiconductor company this morning, and they were talking about the mood in Europe being marginally better. Just wanted to get your perspective, talking to industrial automotive, your broad set of customers, how would you say the general overall mood is spending environment is thus far this year, in particularly Europe?","R. Adam Norwitt","I think it's very hard to say, Amitabh. I mean, I'm not sitting in Frankfurt or the Central Bank here to tell exactly what's going on. Our customers sell a lot of their products outside of Europe, and so I mean, you look at the automotive market, you look at the machine tool industry in a place like Germany, their big market is no longer only in Europe. And so I think that the impact on our business, and on our customers relative to whether that is Spain or Greece or whichever country of the week is causing some problems in that market, we have not seen any significant impact. We saw, in the fourth quarter, some moderation in demand in the industrial market, predominantly driven by distribution where I think the distributors more saw, \"Hey, there's a macro issue, we should trim back our stock.\" As we see actually still continued good performance in Europe and in particular, the growth been driven by sales in the countries like China, of cars, of automation equipment, and robots and things like that. So we have not seen any market change in that. And the kind of clouds that you read about in the paper, yes, they may impact somewhat the mood of customers, but we still see that there's good opportunities there.","Operator","And our next question comes from Matt Sheerin from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just a question on another end market, Adam, for you, on the military and aerospace, you talked about the differences in there and obviously sounded more encouraging on the commercial aerospace side. But are you starting to see more stabilization in terms of the Military business? And what's your outlook this year for the defense portion of your business?","R. Adam Norwitt","I think as I mentioned, the Military business, on a year-over-year basis, was down and certainly, we don't like any market to be down, but we're pleased to see that there was a stabilization in the demand, and that we actually grew on a sequential basis by 5% in the Military market. And our outlook for the second quarter would be to have a further sequential improvement in our sales into that market and not all of that came just from flood recovery. It came really also from the stabilization. And the one thing that I would just reiterate is yes, we know that the budgets are what they are, and there's no doubt about it that there will be budget cuts in certain markets, the U.S. being certainly the most notable one. But clearly, our engineering team, the front end marketing organizations that we have in our military businesses, they are working at a pace actually that is quite significant on new electronics application, the customers in the military market. I mean applications, you would normally think, well, that's probably going to get cut. But in fact, the military is striving to find new electronics that can allow them to save in the end money. And whether that is a UAV where you don't have to train the pilot, whether that is an early warning radar system that is different from an AWACS plane, you name it, there are a lot of new technologies that the military is developing today, actually with a real sense of urgency. It will create budget savings over the next decade, and I think it's those areas where electronics create a real bang for the buck that we see the true opportunity to continue to sustain that business, and to have that business be a contributor to Amphenol in the future. And I think what's encouraging over the last couple of quarters is that the design activity. The activity, engineer to engineer, with our customers is not slowing down, and to the contrary, appears to be moving at a pace that would suggest that there's great opportunities ahead.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And just as a follow-up, looking at the incremental margin contribution last quarter, pretty strong at 30%. Looking at your revenue and EPS guidance for the June quarter, that implies sort of a mid-20s number, which is still pretty strong. As we look at through the rest of the year, on a higher volumes, do you expect similar contribution or would that be lower because you're coming off of a lower base here?","Diana G. Reardon","I think, Matt, from a sequential perspective, we're looking to sort of meet or beat the 25% sequential conversion margin target. And we did very well from an execution standpoint in the first quarter. I think the operating team really came through with a strong performance. As you said, that's incorporated also around that 25%-plus level in Q2, and we would expect to continue that type of a performance on a sequential basis as we move through the rest of the year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Diana, you noted that the interconnect margins year-on-year were pressured by raw material headwinds, which were offset by some cost reductions. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about pricing as a lever to offset that pressure. Is it demand environment such that it's extremely difficult at this point to push through price increases, and what are your expectations for price increases as you go through the course of the year, given that the recent book-to-bill trends have somewhat improved?","Diana G. Reardon","Yes, I mean, I think, in general, we feel that the overall environment economically is a lot more balanced than it was last year. I think that last year, there was a real disconnect between the inflationary pressures and demand, so I think we feel better in general about the environment, which I think means that we would expect the relationship between cost and price to be more normal. And in terms of what is the aggregate impact of pricing on the businesses isn't typically a number we compute or disclose because the business is so diversified and the markets really vary. Pricing trends tend to follow the pricing trends that the end equipment that we sell into have. And so you have what is typically some relatively significant price pressure in the communications pieces of the market, and it's less so when you get into the industrial and then into the defense market. But I think that we do feel that the environment is more balanced, and we feel good about the profitability we were able to achieve in the first quarter. Our guidance reflects a continuation of what we would view as more normal conversion margins, allowing us to continue to expand margins sequentially as we go along during the year. So I think that, that balance between cost and pricing, we expect to be better in 2012 than it was last year.","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Diana, and as a follow-up, maybe a quick one for Adam here. For the commercial aerospace market, Adam, can you give us some sense of what the incremental contribution would be if we split it from unit growth and content growth. I mean, it's great if you could give that level of detail, but if not, can you just comment at least on which will be a larger driver, would it be sort of the unit growth, or is it sort of more of the content growth on top of that?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes, I mean, I'm not going to go into a lot of specifics for competitive reasons, but let me just tell you that as we look forward, obviously, we have some content on existing platforms and as the units go up, that can be a good contributor. But as I've talked about in the past, the new airplane platforms have not only a tremendously higher degree of interconnect content but the technology underlying that product is also more complex. And thereby it's something where our engineering know-how has really proved to show a lot of value with our customers, and thereby our participation is broader. And so I would just tell you that as new platforms ramp up, as they get released, clearly, there is a more multiple -- multiplier effect on that, because the units will grow together as the content grows. And so I think that, that contribution, when those planes reach a full volume, would certainly be more than the contribution of growth of legacy platforms. Today, those new airplanes are still really more in their infancy, and so our growth is probably more balanced between that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mike Wood from Macquarie Capital.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Historically, you've done a great job leveraging SG&A and lowering percentage of sales. Recently, it seems to be tracking sales growth would be above it. Just given the restructuring you've done late last year, what should we expect from this in the near intermediate future?","Diana G. Reardon","Sure. Look, I think that we have historically, as you mentioned, have done a very good job in terms of managing SG&A cost. And we certainly believe that getting a return on that very important investment is important to the performance of the company. And in Q1, as you point out, SG&A was about 12.6% of sales, and this is about the same percentage that we had in Q4, and actually, a little bit higher than Q1 of last year. We do try to target SG&A to grow at a slower pace than sales, and we've been pretty successful in doing that, I think, on a quarter-by-quarter basis, we do sometimes to have quarters that are a little bit higher. About 1\/3 of the increase over last year is really due to higher stock option expense which was included in SG&A. It also includes the amortization of intangibles relating to the acquisitions that we do. So those 2 items put a little bit more pressure on SG&A growth on a year-over-year basis. 12.6% is not the lowest level that we've ever achieved as a company, but relatively speaking, it's still a very low SG&A level and continues to reflect excellent cost control and efficiency by our operating units. And certainly, the benefit of expansion of SG&A and low-cost places, we do continue to deploy a very strong return on investment philosophy with both our sales and engineering efforts. We also believe that having these costs and profit centers will continue to sharpen the focus and align these costs much better with the overall business objective of growth and profitability. So we do still expect, when we would look out at the full year, to see SG&A grow at a slower pace than sales, but as I said, this can vary sometimes quarter-to-quarter. We've historically operated with a very efficient and effective SG&A structure. It's driven great new product development, technology expansion, and we continue to believe that, that's going to be the same as we move ahead.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Very helpful. And the Cable segment operating margins had a very big move up, how much would you attribute to internal actions versus just the competitive landscape?","Diana G. Reardon","Yes, the increase in margins in Cable was certainly influenced, by some degree, by the big increase in volume that they experienced. In addition to that, I think as Adam said in his comments, the mix of product, there was a mix that included some more value-added-type products where we're able to achieve higher margins. And in addition to that, the particular materials that are used in that particular business, particularly in the Cable, which are aluminum and copper, these are 2 materials that are somewhat better than they were on a year-over-year basis. But from a sequential improvement, this is really the volume and the mix of products.","Operator","Your next question comes from Shawn Harrison, Longbow Research.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Just a quick follow-up to that last point before I get to my other question. With the mix benefit from the more value-added this quarter, do you expect Cable margins to hold within this range going forward? And then the follow-up question is just considering the implied organic growth within the updated guidance for the year, still around 2%, which, while good on an even market is maybe a little bit less than what, I think, people maybe believe Amphenol's potentials to do. And so I guess the question is what end markets could drive upside to that organic growth as we look out for the rest of the year? Just to maybe get you a little bit above, say, where the industry forecast is right now, which I think is around 3.5% and I know Amphenol typically doesn't undergrow the industry?","Diana G. Reardon","Sure. I'll just take the first part of the question. I think that we expect, in the second quarter, to see some volume growth relative to Cable and the broadband market. I think that we would expect, at this point, the Cable margins to be somewhere within the same kind of a range that we see in the first quarter. And Adam, if you want to answer the second question?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes. Shawn, appreciate the question, and I think relative to the company's organic growth, first of all, we are always prudent in how we look at the performance in the year. We continue to see that there are uncertainties across the markets and the macro environment, and so we believe that this guidance today is actually still a very strong and prudent guidance. To your question of what markets could drive growth and what markets do we have good expectations for. Obviously, some of our markets have great momentum right now. The industrial market, in addition to the acquisition that we've made, has had very strong organic growth. I mean, growing last quarter by 9%, growth sequentially as well by that same amount. And we see in the industrial market, just tremendous opportunities across the board. Automotive, another market where we believe the expansion of electronics together with not such a bad unit growth really creates for Amphenol a tremendous opportunities here. I think the commercial air market is one that we've spoken about as well where we see that, that's a market that should outperform the total company and clearly has potential beyond even those expectations. Obviously, dependent on the timing of when platforms fly and which platforms those will be. But clearly, the order intake by the commercial air industry continues to be very, very strong. I mean, they really do not let up in terms of the number of orders that are being given to the major plane makers. Those are markets where I think we have good potential. We obviously would hope that an IT market where we've had a couple of quarters or more of what I would call a pause, there is absolutely the demand among enterprises and carriers and institutions to upgrade their data networks to deal with the flood of data that is hitting them. I mean, whether it is the mobile devices that are there, whether it is cars that are now connecting to the Internet, you name it, there is just a tremendous, tremendous increase in the type and the quantity of data that is going through the system and that's at every step of the chain, so to speak. And so I believe that the IT market is one where the spending has to come. What is the timing of that spending is very hard to predict. And is that going to be all at once? Probably not. But our companies and service provider is going to wake up and say, \"We've got to increase our capacity.\" I think that will happen at some point. And I also believe that, that same dynamic is true in wireless infrastructure, even if today, we are at much lower levels than that market was in the past, you just have to be a consumer like I'm sure we all are on the phone, to know that the service is still terrible, and that the potential of what the wireless networks can do and can -- the experience that they can provide to their customers is far beyond where they are today operating. And that just means they need to upgrade their equipment. So I think those are markets where you could have performance at the same time, in light of the uncertainties that are around them, this is what we believe is a very strong and very prudent outlook for the company.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Adam, just following up on some of your comments about the sort of pent-up demand for improved networks. I know that the telecom has been weak for a number of quarters. We've had a bit of an inventory build. It sounds like a lot of companies are a bit more positive on the second half of the year, and I wanted to get a sense from you. Are you seeing more design activity, more interest and are you getting a sense from your customers that we might see some improvement in the second half, or what are your customers telling you?","R. Adam Norwitt","You're talking here about the wireless market, in particular?","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Well, not just the wireless market but also the carrier market and...","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure. I think we saw in this quarter, as I mentioned before, in the wireless carrier market, a sequential uptick in demand, which was very pleasing to see because that had not performed to our expectations previously. And we saw a good year-over-year growth in the IT market, which includes carrier and telecommunication-type equipment. And is that going to be kind of a second half boom? I don't know that I would predict that there would be a boom in the second half. But clearly, in the fourth quarter, there was a tremendous over-inventory position in both of those markets. I think they're working through that inventory in both those markets. And I know that empirically, there is a demand for the equipment and demand for the capacity that, that equipment can create. So I do believe that there can be a good potential for those markets on a sequential basis going forward in the year. Again, what does that mean? Is this kind of a hockey stick? I mean, certainly, we don't anticipate, in our guidance, any kind of such a hockey stick in terms of a massive ramp up in growth in the second half, but I certainly would hope that there would be better performance in the second half than in the first half.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just looking at your growth rate and the implied growth for this year, clearly, well below your historical growth levels. Would you anticipate that as we move through sort of the slow economic recovery and into more of an expansionary period, would you expect to be able to get back to your past growth levels or do you think we're sort of in a slower growth environment for the company?","R. Adam Norwitt","No. Look, we have always had a very clear mission of the company. And that is to outgrow the interconnect market, and we have done that over the better part of a dozen years by more than double and while doing that to grow our margins at also a faster pace. We do not at all give up on that mission, far from it. I think our team has a tremendous conviction to continue that out-performance on the broader market and interconnect market alone is also has a great long-term potential. I mean, I've referred a couple times to what I termed as a revolution in electronics and that is a revolution that drives new functionalities, it creates new applications and thereby creates higher technology requirements for interconnect products. And so we think that the long-term growth opportunity in the industry and the opportunity for Amphenol to outperform that industry is as strong today as it ever was in the past. You're right, I mean, we are in -- there is a sort of slow recovery, time period that we are in today but no doubt about it, this team, this management team around the world is fully committed and confident that we'll continue the track record of growth and success that we've had in the past.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Suva from Citi.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My first question is regarding the M&A processes -- or M&A pricing environment. Have you seen any change in pricing over the last few years, especially with Tyco Electronics buying Deutsche in the low interest rates? Any change in pricing? My second question is you talked about no change in auto from a resin explosion. What about from the Kansas tornadoes, does that impact your commercial aerospace outlook at all?","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure. Thank you very much, Jim. And I think relative to your first question on M&A pricing, look, every company has a negotiation around at an appropriate price. And I think we don't always pay exactly the same price and what our competitors pay for their price, I mean, they certainly all have great reasons to do that, and so I wouldn't necessarily say that there's any sort of empirical change in the M&A pricing or the multiple these companies will pay. Our strategy for M&A is a very long-term strategy. It's one where we incubate relationships with companies, and we eventually reach a meeting of the minds with the owners of that company at a price that is a fair and reasonable price from both of our perspectives. And there's not a page in the newspaper that you can find that says now the new multiple is X,Y, or Z. I don't see, necessarily, that there's a big change. The one thing that certainly we hear some of is that is there a different willingness of people to sell given certain entrepreneurs expectations of tax law changes. That may be something that could happen, not that we have seen any significance, but it's something that you can sort of understand as an outsider, as people think tax rates are going to go up significantly, so maybe they would choose to sell at a different moment. You mentioned as well this unfortunate tornado that hit, I think, Spirit Aero Systems in Kansas, this doesn't have any meaningful impact to us, and we certainly wish them all well in their recovery. I mean, we have our own history in dealing with natural disasters. Not tornadoes fortunately, but floods and I know that, that is a very, very strong team out in Wichita, and I would be shocked if they did not recover at a much faster pace than the outside world would expect.","Operator","And our next question comes from William Stein with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","William Stein - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Also on M&A. Actually, it seemed at the end of last year, that prices were going a bit nuts with that Deutsche deal and there was also Esterline or Serio [ph] that was very higher multiple, and I think the deal you did, Adam, that you announced last quarter looked to be at a higher multiple, but the one that you announced today looks actually less costly. And I'm wondering if you can comment on profitability or growth on this deal? And then also, maybe comment a little bit on the backlog. I know it's always full of many different types of deals but I'm wondering if there's been any shift in terms of the size or timing or growth or margin profile of the deals that you see as potentially closing in the next year?","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure. No, I think our deal that we closed in the fourth quarter, FEP, we paid a very reasonable multiple for. It was -- it would not have been a multiple like the ones that you're quoting, of the other deal. And the one that this quarter we also paid what I would consider reasonable and fair multiple for the company, different markets have different multiples as well, different companies have different dynamics and risks to them. Both of these companies were good contributors from a margin standpoint, and so there was not a massive difference in terms of the profitability or the growth profile of those companies. They're both excellent, excellent companies, and we're very proud to have them both now as part of Amphenol. And again, with the management teams together that were running that company before, we have all the same people as part of Amphenol today. And I think that is a unique aspect of how we do on acquisitions and it also adds more to that value question, because for us, what is critical in an acquisition is technology and people. And then is it complementary. And so as you look at these 2 recent acquisitions and you go back even to the CEMM-THOME acquisition which we did earlier last year, all of those companies have not had one change in the management team as they have joined Amphenol. They continue to run it but they run the company in the broader context of Amphenol with the broader opportunities that we can create for those companies. And so our goal, truly, as it relates to these multiples, is that in hindsight, the multiple should not matter, because we will have create a lot of value with those companies, long-term, on the backs of the same individuals who have created that successful business before. Relative to the backlog of our M&A pipeline, I mean, we still feel that's a very good backlog, I wouldn't say there's any difference do it. I mean, obviously, there have been some big companies who have been acquired recently. But that doesn't change the nature of our backlog as a company. We -- it is a fabulous, fabulous industry from the standpoint of the opportunities to acquire entrepreneurial companies with excellent technology that are still complementary to Amphenol. I mean, despite the tremendous breadths that we have as a company, having really industry-leading breadth of products and technologies in market, everyday, we happen upon, it seems a new company that is in fact, complementary despite the incredible scope that we have already built as a company and so that gives me a lot of optimism for the fact that, that program can have good continuation in the future and will continue as Diana referred to in her remarks, will continue to be a good contributor to the growth of the company, long-term.","Operator","Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions from my side. First, I was just trying to understand the fiscal year guide a little bit better. I was at the midpoint of your fiscal year guidance, it looks like you're basically implying revenues to grow flat to 1% from June to September, September to December, yet when you talk about end markets, you seem to be fairly positive, I think, in terms of growth expectations in those end markets. So I'm trying to reconcile the delta between a positive commentary on the end markets versus the guide that implies flattish back half. Is that typical Amphenol conservatism or am I missing something there?","Diana G. Reardon","Well, I mean, I think, Amit, as you know, we guide based on what we see at the time. We do a very bottoms-up forecasting process at all of our units and all of our markets. And if think mathematically, what you say, I think, is correct. And we obviously have given guidance specifically for Q2 and then for the full year, not having given it specifically for Q3 and Q4. Q3 can sometimes be -- go sort of either way versus Q2, depending a lot and how the communications markets flow, depending on product introductions, timing and these types of things. And I think that the guidance as we've put it together at this point is what we believe is prudent and makes sense and it's what we expect at the time and as we go along, as we go through Q2 and close out that quarter, we'll certainly update the guidance when we get to that point.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All right. And I guess could you talk with the debt that you guys refinanced intra-quarter, can you talk about, maybe I missed it, what impact did that have on the EPS for the quarter and for the full year?","Diana G. Reardon","Sure. I mean, the $500 million of notes is at about a 4% rate. These are 10-year notes, borrowings under the revolver are probably less than 1\/2 that from a rate perspective, so it did have some impact. And I think you can see that in the increase -- in interest expense, excuse me, between Q4 and Q1. This is something that we felt, made a lot of sense to take advantage of these rates and put in a longer piece of financing than we've done in the past, to give us really more liquidity in the short term under the revolving credit facility to allow us to take advantage of different types of opportunities that may come along during the year 2012.","Operator","And your next question comes from Tony Kure from KeyBanc.","Anthony C. Kure - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick follow-ups. On the interest expense line, I just want to follow-up, I think, Diana, you mentioned that interest expense should tick up a little bit here in the second quarter. With that number as a placeholder, I mean, is that sort of the balance or the level at which we can expect interest expense here going forward for the balance of the year then?","Diana G. Reardon","Yes, I mean, if you -- under this current structure, the bulk of the debt is fixed. So yes, I mean, that would be a good assumption to make.","Anthony C. Kure - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just obviously, we talked geographical a little bit about Europe, but there are some concerns about a decelerating China too. Just wanted to get your take on what your outlook would be, or what maybe you've heard recently in regards to demand trends and along the lines of deceleration there if you've seen that?","R. Adam Norwitt","I mean, I think that -- we read the papers like you do and deceleration from 8% to 7.5% or from my 9% to 8%, whatever these numbers are, honestly, we don't see, necessarily, that reflected in our business because we don't care so much about the broader macro trend as much as we care about our people buying electronics and our company's buying electronics. And I think there are certain trends in China, which, long-term, have tremendous positive potential for our company and for our industry. I mean, just think about the automation, it has to happen in China because of the increases in labor rates, and we have talked about these increases in labor rates in China. One of the answers to that is the dramatic influx of automation equipment that has to happen and that's just one example. I mean, the high-speed rail that is being installed, the oil expiration that is happening in China, automotive industry continues to grow. And even if the growth in units is down, the sophistication of the cars, electronics that go into the cars is greater. The domestic commercial aero market is one that clearly has tremendous potential going forward. And so I think that macro numbers shifting from 8% to 7.5% or even if it were to go lower than that, that is not something that I believe necessarily moves our business towards a more negative outlook. We continue to have a very positive outlook for that market.","Anthony C. Kure - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And just the last one, on the acquisition sort of closed in early April. So from a revenue standpoint adding to the year, is it fair to just assign a small growth number to that or factor that in for your revenue guidance, that's included in your revenue guidance, right? So would that be a fair, linear way to look at the revenue additions for the acquisition?","Diana G. Reardon","Yes.","Operator","And your next question comes from Steve Fox from Cross Research.","Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC","Just one question for me. When you go back over your prepared remarks, Adam, it seems like you highlighted new product momentum in 3 areas. One being mobile phones, another being information and data comm, and third being broadband. Can you just maybe give us a little bit more color on the types of products you're talking about, where they're going into and why you're so excited about those areas?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes. Absolutely, I'm happy to do that. I mean, I think, with the one where I emphasized it the most was clearly in IT data comm and that is a market where because of the data demands that are being pushed onto the network at either the carrier or the enterprise or the institutional level, that there is just a real, for lack of a better word, a need for speed for our customers. And our innovations that we have been promoting in back link connectors and high-speed I\/O and high-speed cable assemblies have really taken stronghold with customers who are just scrounging to find every way possible, to pump more data through the same piece of equipment. And so as the new releases of these equipment come on, and there are releases in servers and new storage systems and new networking hardware, as those new releases come and as they fill their pipeline of product, those high-speed products are one area where we see a lot of potential. Another potential is really in power where again, as related to that data center and the expansion of data center equipment, the efficiency of power that customers are asking for is really accelerating in very much a logarithmic fashion. And so we have been working just intensively with customers, help them enable more efficient power interconnect systems. Those are 2 related to IT. Related to mobile devices, I mean, obviously, our strength in antennas is one area where as customers have to have new devices like a tablet computer, which have to have multiple access points to multiple networks, interaction of those antennas with each other, the sort of isolation of the signal, the ability to fit those products into very, very challenging form factors. These are the kind of new product momentum and innovations that have been very, very significant in that market. I think relative to broadband, Diana mentioned that we have seen really strength as well and some of our value-added products and these are new innovative value-added products that help either in home install or in addition, in the head end. The head end is an area where the interconnect creates a bottleneck, because especially with the cable base high-speed internet, it is really the number of access points in a given piece of hardware that drives the ability to service those high speeds. And so if you can collapse those access points through a smaller form factor, or a higher density solution as one example, that creates then, value for your customers in the broadband. Those are just some examples I could go on, Steve, for hours here and -- but would not want to take everybody's time. I think that, that's -- I think at that point, we would wish everybody well and appreciate again all of your interest in the company and wish you a pleasant continuation into the second quarter.","Diana G. Reardon","Thank you.","R. Adam Norwitt","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you for attending today's conference and have a nice day."],"2237":["Amphenol Corp. (NYSE:APH) Q1 2016 Earnings Call April 20, 2016  1:00 PM ET","Executives","Craig Lampo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer, Director","Analysts","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","James Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Securities","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Brian White - Drexel Hamilton","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Operator","Hello, and welcome to the First Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.","Craig Lampo","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Craig Lampo, and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We'd like to welcome everyone to our first quarter conference call. Q1 results were released this morning. And I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter; and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends and then Q&A.","The company closed the first quarter with sales and EPS of $1.451 billion and $0.59, excluding one-time items. Sales were up 9% in U.S. dollars and up 11% in local currencies compared to the first quarter of 2015. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currencies, sales in the first quarter decreased 1%. Sequentially, sales were up 1% in U.S. dollars and down 8% organically after a seasonally stronger fourth quarter.","Breaking down sales into our two segments. Our Cable business, which comprises 6% of our sales, was down 1% from last year primarily due to the effective currency translation. The Interconnect business, which comprises 94% of our sales, was up 10% from last year, primarily due to the impact of acquisition. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.","Operating income, excluding one-time items, increased to $270 million in the first quarter. Operating margin, excluding one-time items, was 18.6%, compared to 19.6% in the first quarter of 2015. The decline in operating margin is due primarily to the lower profitability level of the FCI business acquired in early January.","As discussed on our last earnings call, the FCI acquisition is accretive on an earnings per share basis, but reduces the company's overall operating income percentage as the business currently operates at a lower level of profitability than the average of the company. We continue to be very excited about the potential of the FCI acquisition and expect their operating income margins to improve over time, based on the combination of their excellent management team, leading technology and our strong operating discipline.","From a segment standpoint, in the Cable segment, margins were 13.3%, compared to 12.1% last year. The increase in margins related primarily due to strong operating execution and some favorable impact from commodities. In the Interconnect segment, margins were 20.6%, compared to 21.8% last year due to the acquisition of FCI.","We are very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture, in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment.","Due to careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving an enhanced performance.","The company has recorded one-time charges of approximately $30 million or $0.09 per share during the first quarter related to the FCI acquisition, which closed in January. These include the acquisition-related transaction costs, amortization related to the value associated with acquired backlog and post-closing restructuring charges. The acquisition-related transaction costs includes professional fees, transaction taxes and other external transaction-related costs.","Interest expense for the quarter was $18 million, compared to $17 million last year, reflecting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the company's stock buyback program. The company's effective interest rate was 26.5% both in the first quarter of 2016 and 2015, excluding one-time items. On an as reported basis, the company's effective tax rate was 28.7% and 26.5% for the first quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively.","Net income, excluding one-time items, was a strong 13% of sales in the first quarter of 2016, although it was impacted, as previously discussed, from the acquisition of FCI. EPS was $0.59 in the first quarter of 2016, excluding one-time items. And on an as reported basis, EPS was $0.50 and $0.57 for the first quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively.","Orders for the quarter were $1.479 billion, a 10% increase over the first quarter of 2015, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02 to l. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $194 million in the first quarter or approximately 123% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income.","From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $934 million at the end of March; and inventory days were 84 days, up five days compared to December and within the normal range for the first quarter.","Accounts receivable was approximately $1.2 billion at the end of March; and day\u2019s sales outstanding was 75 days, up approximately four days from December and within the normal range. Accounts payable was $615 million at the end of March; and payable days were 55 days, up one day compared to December.","The cash flow from operations of $194 million, along with commercial paper borrowings of $53 million and stock option proceeds of $19 million, were used primarily to fund acquisitions of $1.2 billion; to purchase approximately $49 million of the company's stock; to fund net capital expenditures of $38 million; and to fund dividend payments of $43 million, which resulted in a decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $1.1 billion net of translation. As we've mentioned previously, the purchase price for FCI was funded entirely with offshore cash.","During the quarter, the company repurchased 1 million shares under its January 2015 10 million share stocks repurchase program. 4.5 million shares remain available under the program through January 2017. At March 31, cash and short-term investments were $714 million, the majority of which was held outside the U.S.","On March 1, 2016, the company entered into a new $2 billion senior revolving credit facility, which replaced the previous $1.5 billion facility. At quarter end, the company had issued $877 million under its commercial paper program; and effective April 1, the commercial paper program was also increased from $1.5 billion to $2 billion. The company's cash and availability under our credit facilities now total approximately $1.8 billion.","Total debt at March 31 was $2.9 billion and net debt is approximately $2.2 billion. In Q1 2016, EBITDA was approximately $312 million.","From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance. And Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends.","Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much, Craig. And I'd like to add my welcome to all of you on the phone here today from sunny Wallingford, Connecticut.","As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight a few of our first quarter achievements here. I'll then discuss the trends and progress across our served markets. And then finally, I'll make a few comments on our outlook for the second quarter, as well as for the full year; and then of course there'll be time for questions at the end.","With respect to the first quarter, we're very pleased that our results in the first quarter were stronger than expected as we exceeded the high-end of our guidance in sales and earnings; and that's despite continued market uncertainty. Our revenues increased by 9% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies, reaching $1.451 billion.","And very importantly, the company booked a new record of $1.479 billion in orders, which represented a book-to-bill of 1.02 to 1. As Craig went through and as we had anticipated, our margins, after acquisition-related expenses, were lower than prior year due to the impact of FCI, but reached to higher than expected 18.6% operating margins. And operating cash flow in the quarter was again a very strong $194 million.","And I just have to say once again, how proud I am of this entrepreneurial Amphenol team who once again has reconfirmed the value of both their discipline, as well as their very important agility; and that has driven strong performance despite what are still very significant uncertainties in the worldwide economy.","Now turning to our trends across our served markets. I would just point out that once again in the quarter, we continue to have a real tremendous balance across our end market diversification, as no one of our markets represented more than 19% of our sales in the first quarter; and that's after including FCI, which we acquired at the beginning of the quarter.","Turning first to the military market. The military market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were down slightly in U.S. dollars and in local currencies from prior year, as growth in avionics, airframe and ordinance was offset by moderated sales to communications and vehicle applications. And sequentially, our sales were down slightly from the fourth quarter.","At the end of the first quarter, we were instructed by the United States Defense Logistics Agency, or the DLA, to stop the shipment of several of our military specification connector products that are sold by one of our operations into the U.S. military market. This was due to the sourcing of certain non-critical piece parts from non-approved locations including China, as well as delays in regular product testing.","I'd just say that we understand that there are no alleged quality issues with respect to these products; and I'd also just reaffirm that our practices, we believe, are common in the industry and thus we have expressed disagreement with the delays strict to rule interpretation. Nevertheless, we have complied with the DLAs order and we're currently executing on a plan to meet their requirement, which we expect to be completed within the next two quarters at the latest. Let me just also note that the specific products that are impacted represent less than 10% of our annual military sales.","Despite the short-term regulatory challenge, our team continues to do an excellent job of strengthening Amphenol's overall position in the military market. And looking ahead, while we expect sales in the second quarter to moderate slightly from these levels due to this delay issue, we do continue to expect growth in the low-single digits for the full year of 2016.","Amphenol remains the leader in the military interconnect industry with the broadest range of products across virtually all defense equipment; and this is a position of strength that we look forward to building upon into the future.","The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter; and sales in this market were up slightly from prior year, as stronger sales onto new airplane platforms were offset by continued reductions in commercial helicopter and business jet sales. Sequentially, our sales were a bit softer than expected as they were down slightly from the fourth quarter.","Looking ahead, while we expect a slight moderation of sales in the second quarter, we continue to expect growth for the full year of 2016, as production volumes of new airplane platforms ramp up. And I can just reaffirm that we are very pleased with our strong position in the commercial air market. And we continue to take excellent advantage of the proliferation of new electronics on next-generation commercial aircraft, which we're enabling with our broadened range of high-technology interconnect products.","The industrial market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew a very strong 16% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currencies, driven by contributions from the FCI acquisition, together with growth in the hybrid bus and truck, instrumentation, medical and alternative energy segments.","Organically, sales were essentially flat as growth in those segments was offset by continued significant declines in several markets, including oil and gas in particular. Sequentially, our sales grew by 9% largely due to the benefits of FCI.","For the second quarter, we anticipate sales to increase moderately from these current levels. And we continue to expect very strong sales growth in the industrial market for the full year, as we benefit from the contributions of FCI together with organic growth from a range of segments across the industrial market.","We remain very proud of our diversified industrial business and we continue to make progress in selling an ever broader range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products into this exciting market. In particular, I would just commend our team, who has done an outstanding job of continuing to unearth growth opportunities amidst the backdrop of what is clearly a more somber global industrial market outlook.","The automotive market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter; and sales increased a strong 11% in U.S. dollars, 13% in local currency and 6% organically. And this was driven by expanded sales of our products used in a wide array of new vehicle electronics, as well as growth in hybrid electric vehicles in which we have strong content. Sequentially, our sales increased by 6%.","We continue to have a positive outlook for the automotive market, as we drive a broadened range of interconnect and sensor products across a more diversified array of vehicles and onboard electronics around the world, all while at the same time continuing to identify and leverage complementary high-technology acquisitions. We look forward to realizing the benefits from this approach for many, many years to come.","Looking to the second quarter, we expect sales to again increase from these levels; and for the full year of 2016, we remain confident to achieve strong growth in the automotive market.","The mobile devices market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter. And as we had expected coming into the first quarter, our sales were down by 6% from prior year and just over 30% from the fourth quarter.","Just once again, our team demonstrated incredible agility in this quarter as they were able to flex their resources quickly in the face of the significant sequential reduction, all while staying poised to capitalize on any opportunities for incremental sales that may become available in the market.","We're very confident that our highly reactive and agile organization will continue to secure a strong position in the dynamic mobile devices market; and we are encouraged by our excellent technology positions across a wide range of new mobile computing platforms.","While we do expect sales in the second quarter to increase sequentially by at least 20%, we continue to expect low to mid-single digit decline in our sales for the full year of 2016. Regardless of this more muted outlook for the full year, we remain extremely confident that our team has positioned us to benefit from any increases in demand that may arise in this exciting market.","The mobile network represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. And sales were better than expected in the first quarter, growing from prior year by 19% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically, as we benefited from the contributions of FCI together with stronger sales in particular to network operators across several geographies. Sequentially, we grew by 22% from the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the addition of FCI.","We're very pleased in the first quarter to have achieved renewed organic growth in the mobile networks market; and I think that this is a strong reflection of the company's ongoing efforts to expand our position with mobile network service providers, as well as equipment makers around the world.","Those customers continue to drive their networks to higher levels of performance, as mobile users, the end users, ultimately demand ever greater bandwidth and more comprehensive coverage.","Looking into the second quarter, we expect our sales to remain essentially at these first quarter levels. And while we continue to expect strong full year growth with the addition of FCI, we think it remains still too early to predict organic growth for the mobile networks market for the full year of 2016. Regardless, we remain well-positioned to capitalize on any growth opportunity that should arise in this market.","The information technology and data communications market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. And as expected, sales were up strongly from prior year and prior quarter, as contributions from FCI offset some organic moderation in sales. Our sales overall were up 21% versus prior year.","With the broadened technology offering and expanded reach into customers that we have gained with the FCI acquisition, we continue to make excellent progress in our development of advanced high-technology products, as well as in our penetration of the many newly arising web service and data center customers.","In particular, we're helping both these new customers as well as our traditional customers in their drive to raise the levels of performance of their equipment to support ongoing and dramatic increases in data traffic.","Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect sales to increase slightly from these levels, and we remain confident in achieving strong double-digit growth for the full year of 2016 with the contributions from FCI.","The broadband communications market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased from prior year by 2% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currencies, as multiservice operators, in particular in North America, began to expand their purchasing volumes. Our sales grew by 4% sequentially. While we were very pleased to see these early signs of renewed growth in the broadband market and while we do expect a slight increase from these levels in the second quarter, we continue to believe that the broadband market in 2016 will remain at roughly last year's levels.","Nevertheless, as the industry eventually digests the many corporate consolidations that are ongoing, we are well positioned with our expanded range of Interconnect and Cable products to capitalize on any growth opportunities that may emerge.","So, just in summary with respect to the first quarter, I just want to tell you how proud I am of the company's strong start to 2016. While the global market environment remains uncertain, the Amphenol organization is executing extraordinarily well both organically and through our acquisition program in expanding our market position while strengthening the company's financial performance.","The company's superior results are a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages. Our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across a diverse range of markets, our worldwide presence, a lien and flexible cost structure and most importantly our agile entrepreneurial management team.","Now turning to the outlook for the second quarter and the full year, based on a continuation of the current uncertain economic environment and assuming constant exchange rates, we now expect in the second quarter and the full-year 2016 the following results.","For the second quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1.495 billion to $1.535 billion and earnings per share in the range of $0.62 to $0.64 respectively. This represents the sales and EPS increase, excluding one-time items, versus prior year of 11% to 14% and 7% to 10% respectively.","For the full-year 2016, we now anticipate sales in the range of $6.080 billion to $6.200 billion and earnings per share, excluding one-time items, in the range of $2.56 to $2.62 respectively. For the full year, this now represents sales and EPS growth excluding one-time items of 9% to 11% and 5% to 8% respectively over 2015 levels.","We're very encouraged by the company's robust start to 2016. And we all look forward to driving further strength going forward, even given the many dynamics in the global economy. I'm confident in the ability of our standing management team to build upon that strength and to continue to capitalize on the many opportunities both to grow our market position and to expand our profitability throughout 2016.","Operator, at that point, we'd be happy to take any questions if there maybe.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The question-and-answer period will now begin. And our first question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan from the Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes. Thank you. Adam, on the DLA issue, can you perhaps help us think to what percentage of the bill of material is subject to these procurement restrictions? And logistically, does this sort of, in the long run, affect the way you're going to have to source and where you're going to manufacture? Does it affect your cost structure at all, or do you view this just as a transitory thing within a couple of quarters where you overcome these supply chain issues? And I have a follow-up.","Adam Norwitt","Yeah. Well, thank you very much, Wamsi. I think with respect to, the first part of your question, as it relates to the bill of materials, I don't know whether you mean the bill of materials in terms of our product range or what do we represent on the bill of materials of our customers. So, maybe I'll answer both.","On one, I would just tell you that connectors represent a small percentage of the overall bill of materials, but we're the largest connector manufacturer in the defense industry. So, we have a very, very broad presence across essentially every equipment that there is. As it relates to our products, I think I mentioned that the products that issued here; number one, they come from one facility; and number two, they represent less than 10% of our overall military sales. So, from that perspective, it is a relatively minor impact to the overall military business that we have even if one or two of those products can end up on lots of different systems around the world. We do believe this will be a transitory issue. Let me just say that very clearly.","We're working very rapidly to address the demands of the DLA. And our team is well, well along in that process. And as I mentioned, we expect this at most to be a two-quarter disruption at the extent that it is. Will it mean that we will have to source certain things in certain different places? Absolutely, because ultimately part of the issue arose from sourcing of components in a place that they now have decided is not appropriate to source from. So, we have already resourced those products.","And I can tell you today that the vast majority of what we need to resource has already been resourced. And ultimately, I can tell you that our company is very good at managing through any cost impact that would come from that. We don't expect any material changes to our profitability in that business long-term.","Wamsi Mohan","All right. Great. Thanks, Adam. I appreciate the detail. And as a follow-up, on the mobile devices, you noted, if I heard you right, 20% quarter-on-quarter increase. I know obviously like 1Q was a fairly tough quarter across the entire mobile supply chain. It seems as though your 2Q quarter-on-quarter increase is actually somewhat better than what a lot in the industry are witnessing. And I was wondering if you could share any color on what is driving that sequential growth here from somewhat low levels arguably in 1Q? Thanks.","Adam Norwitt","Yeah. Well, no, I appreciate that. Look, I think the first quarter, we view that as a normal quarter. I mean the reality is, if you look at our results over many years, the first quarter is usually down somewhere between, I don't know, 20%, 35%. So, was this slightly the high end of that? Maybe, but it was not out of the ordinary as far as we're concerned. That is what it is usually in the first quarter.","I can't comment on what others are seeing in the second quarter. I can only comment on the fact that our team continues to do a wonderful job to take advantage of every opportunities that is present in the market, whether that is on new programs, taking share on other programs, developing new products, expanding the range of products that we sell, expanding the range of customers to whom we sell those products, and the different types of platforms that are there, because you're dealing with platforms everything within mobile computing devices that can be tablet, computers, that can be laptops, that can be phones, that can be accessories, wearables, all those kind of things.","And I think our team does a fabulous job of continuing to diversify their business, expand and deepen their presence with customers and ultimately that's what we see going to the second quarter with the robust sequential outlook that we have.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citi. Your line is now open.","James Suva","Thank you. And congratulations to you and your team there at Amphenol. I think most are aware of your very good acquisition strategy and how strong it's been. And with interest rates so low, can you talk a little bit about your comfort level for continuing to do acquisitions or maybe are there debt to capital or debt to EBITDA levels or something you're mindful of, or it seems like the cash flow generated nature of this industry really supports a meaningful still room for M&A. So, can you talk about sometimes we get pushback about, oh, the company can't lever up any more or things like that, but can you just kind of talk about where your comfort level is from a financing perspective? Thank you.","Adam Norwitt","Yeah. I'll let Craig talk first about the capital structure in the company, and then I'll maybe make a few more comments.","Craig Lampo","Sure. So, Jim, at the end of the quarter, we had about $1.8 billion of capacity under our revolver and cash from availability perspective after we did the new revolving credit facility that we entered in the first quarter that I mentioned in my comments, which certainly we believe is very strong capacity and certainly does even take into account the strong operating cash flow that the company continues to generate.","From a pro forma leverage perspective, we're approximately 1.5 times at the end of the quarter, which is certainly well within our comfort level, certainly giving full on the appropriate consideration to the importance of our investment grade rating. So, I would say that we're very comfortable and certainly have sufficient flexibility from a leverage standpoint, and believe that we have plenty of capacity for future acquisitions as well as any stock repurchases that may be warranted.","Adam Norwitt","And I think that's a very important backdrop, which is, we continued to be a very aggressive acquirer in the industry. We have a lot of capacity. We made just, at the beginning of the year, closed the largest acquisition in our history. Last year, we completed three other acquisitions and we continue to have a strong pipeline. At the same time, we will always be a disciplined acquirer.","So, we look for companies that have great people that have great technology, that have a strongly complementary market position. And then we look to pay fair prices for those companies. And the fact that interest rates are low or not low, doesn't necessarily enter into our calculus so much in terms of the price we're willing to pay on things and how much of our capital we're willing to put to work. We view acquisitions as a very, very long-term initiative. This is not a short-term approach to say, well, that can be accretive in the year and thus we will do the acquisition. We're very, very thoughtful about that. And thus, we spend a lot of time. We date many, many, many companies over time. And then eventually, the select few of those that we date ultimately become strong acquisitions for the company. And we will continue to follow that same approach regardless of what short-term interest rates do or what the overall market multiples will do.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner. Your line is now open.","Sherri Scribner","Hi, thanks. Adam, it sounded from your commentary that the macro continued to be challenging and looking at the guidance for the full year for many of your segments, the growth seems to be somewhat challenged. I guess I'm trying to think about the outlook with the FCI business obviously in there. How should we think about organic growth for you guys this year? It seems like it maybe low single-digits. And how should we think about the connector industry market growth at this point?","Adam Norwitt","Yeah. Well, thank you very much, Sherri. I think we don't have a different view about our organic growth this year than we did when we came into the year. And I think at the time we talked about the organic growth being kind of at the midpoint just a hair above flat. And I think at the high point it was somewhere between flat, I think, down to the up 1% or something in that range. And we don't have a different view about the \u2013 or down 1% to up 2% I guess it was.","We don't have a different view about the organic growth of the company this year. Now, when you look at the different markets, it's not that every market has that somber outlook. And I think this really speaks to the value of the diversification in the company. We have one market, mobile devices, which is not a small market for us. Last year in particular, it was a significant 18%, 19% of sales market and we do expect that that market will be down in the coming year, and that's all organic.","On the other side, we have a positive organic outlook for markets like automotive, industrial. We have a positive outlook for aeros for commercial aviation and others are more flat. So, I think the value of the diversification in a time like this where there is no question that the overall growth environment is more muted is really coming through in 2016.","What does that mean in terms of the overall growth of the Interconnect industry? There are many studies about that. I think when you compare us to others, you see still a more favorable outlook and a more favorable ultimately results in terms of the organic growth compared to the overall industry. And our goal, as a company, continues to be to outgrow the industry in every environment and through every cycle. And if you look over the course of the last 10 years, 15 years, we have outgrown the industry by a significant margin and we still have a long-term conviction to continue to do that going forward.","Sherri Scribner","That's helpful. Thanks, Adam. And then just thinking about the margin profile as we move forward with FCI. Is there a point when you think that FCI's business can get to your corporate average levels and how long does that take? Thanks.","Craig Lampo","Yeah. I think, Sherri, what I would say on that is that we've taken some great actions I think in the first quarter that provide a real solid foundation for future performance for FCI. I mean, as a management team, we continue to be committed to improving that overall profitability of FCI. And I'm confident over time that we will be successful on bringing up to that pre-acquisition average for the company.","I would say in regards to our full year guidance, it's only been three months since we acquired the company. And certainly it takes some time to see the impact of these actions. So, I would say that our current guidance really isn't so different than what we guided to in January of the top line and bottom line perspective. But I think, over time, we are committed to getting them. I wouldn't necessarily give you a specific timeframe for doing that, but I think if you look at our history and our success at prior acquisitions, I think you can feel confident as we do that we will be successful in doing that over some period of time.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison from Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","Shawn Harrison","Hi. Afternoon, everybody.","Adam Norwitt","Good afternoon.","Shawn Harrison","Adam, I guess the mobile infrastructure market, you cited a better start to the year than maybe previously anticipated, but then echoing some caution about the year getting better. And so, maybe if you could just characterize what you're seeing out there? Is there something regionally that's giving you pause or is it just, let's wait and see how the June quarter plays out before getting a little bit more bullish on that market?","Adam Norwitt","Well, Shawn, as you know, one swallow does not make a summer. And I think this is a market which had a very challenging year last year. There is still volatility in the market, there's still a lot going on from a corporate perspective in that space. We had a great quarter in the first quarter, and it was better than we had expected. There's no question about that. But I think it's a little too early to say that that is going to be then a trend of growth in the year. Should the opportunity present itself to have that growth in the year, our organization is so well positioned.","And the one thing that we felt very good about in the first quarter is that the growth, that did not just come out of one place. We saw strength in North America. We saw strength in some places even like in India. We saw some strength in Europe. We didn't see so much strength in Asia in the quarter. And I would say that we probably saw more strength coming out of our sales of our product direct to service providers as opposed to the equipment manufacturers. And you know that there have been many widely reported corporate combinations among the OEMs in that space. So, there's still a lot going on in the industry that makes one take maybe a more prudent outlook for such a market, but to the extent that there is spending that is going to be there, there's no question in my mind that we will capture more than our fair share of it.","Shawn Harrison","That's helpful. And as a follow up just on mobile devices, it's tough to actually say what seasonality is in the back half given its varied significantly for you over the past couple of years. But, at least with a strong second quarter, it implies a muted ramp into the back half versus maybe what you saw last year even a few years before. Are you seeing a shift in terms of how that market is ramping or are you just taking a more cautious view on what those devices will grow overall for the year?","Adam Norwitt","Yeah. No, look, I think, we still have an outlook for second half to be much stronger than the first half, but you're correct in your calculation that it would be a lower ramp. Last year, our second half sales in mobile devices were, I think, 40%, 45% compared to the first half. And I think our guidance here would imply something more into the mid to high 20%s. So, no doubt about it.","Now, in a given year, is there some years where it's more like this year and some years more like last year, I think we've seen all those different scenarios over time. I think that the growth that we're seeing in the second quarter, maybe that's a little more than we would normally see in the second quarter and maybe the second half is a hair less than we would see in other years. And so maybe that's a little bit more in balance from that perspective. But I can tell you that we do always take a prudent approach to our outlook in this market. These are products that sometimes have lifecycles of less than a quarter. And so, we want to be very careful in terms of representing what our customers tell us while also taking some of our past experience in terms of how those ramp ups ultimately go and that's how we craft the guidance.","I think what everybody knows, who's followed the company for a long time, is to the extent that opportunities do arise either a competitor falls down on the job or a customer sells more of their products, our team has always been impeccably able to capitalize on those opportunities. And we'll, no doubt, be in that same position this year should those opportunities arise.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amit Daryanani","Perfect. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I have a question and a follow-up as well. I guess, Adam, when you think about the stop shipment impact from the DLA, do we think about this 1% revenue, $10 million, $11 million a quarter call it, essentially seizing in June and September, and then you're having a potentially snap up effect in the December quarter. Is that the way to think about it? Is that sort of what you baked into your model, and do you run a risk of share loss in this market given the fact that it's going to take two quarters to resolve it?","Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much, Amit. I think that I would not anticipate any material snap back in the fourth quarter. I think the thing is still playing out. We are just over 30 days or so into this wonderful experience with the DLA. But no doubt about it, our team will be poised as soon as we are off that stop ship to satisfy every one of our customers as much as they need to be, but I wouldn't necessarily assume some massive snap back.","Look, relative to share, in the next two quarters are some people going to take some orders that otherwise we would have taken, I guess by definition that's the case. But I can tell you, as a company who has been through two floods and this is the same facility, which was having a flood in the past, and by the way, I could tell you that these issues relate back even to the time of the flood, but that's not for regulators to sympathize with. I can tell you that this is an organization who does not accept to lose a position, period.","And with our breadth of technologies, with our program presence, a two quarter stop shipment is not going to hurt Amphenol in the medium-term or long-term in our market position. In fact, I can tell you, we're going to come back so much stronger after this, that I would expect over the long-term, we will further build our leadership position in the military market.","Amit Daryanani","Perfect. That's very helpful. And I guess, Adam, I heard you guys talk about the M&A discussion with Jim. I'm curious, you guys have plenty of liquidity as you sit today, what drove the decision to expand the commercial paper program, increase your revolver further at this point, given the fact you have enough liquidity and it doesn't seem like M&A is any more eminent today than it's ever been in the history of the company?","Craig Lampo","Sure. I think I'll take that one, Amit. I think the reasoning for that is really just more based on the size of the company today. We thought it was very prudent to increase the capacity of the company. We're a much bigger company than we were when we initially entered into the credit facility at the $1.5 billion size. We want to \u2013 we use most of our cash from a domestic perspective. We use for our share repurchase and dividend programs so domestically, we generally use our facilities for that in addition to any M&A that may come along. So there wasn't any other reason other than just to increase our capacity, and given the size of the company, so to put us in a better position long-term, but I wouldn't read so much into that.","In regards to our overall capacity, again, this $1.8 billion that I mentioned before, which includes the $1.1 billion of availability at the end of the quarter under our credit facility and then the additional $700 million of cash that we had on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is now open.","Matthew Sheerin","Yes. Thanks. Just a couple of quick ones for me, Adam. Just regarding the auto business, it sounds like the momentum is continuing there, you talked about good growth rates for the year. Within that business, the heavy truck and off-road vehicle area, I know has been mixed too weak for other suppliers and I know that tends to be a good margin business relative to the rest of your auto. How are things tracking there and what's the outlook versus geographies for that business?","Adam Norwitt","Sure. Well, first, I would just make one clarification which is, we don't classify heavy truck as part of our automotive business, that's part of our industrial business.","Matthew Sheerin","Got it. Okay.","Adam Norwitt","I certainly wouldn't assume that our margins are different on a heavy truck than it would be on overall automotive. So automotive is for us really automotive, as it is called. No, we're so happy with the automotive business. And you've followed us long enough to have seen the trajectory of that business over the last six years, seven years going from I think at its low 0.56% of sales to today 19% of sales, and we've done that both through some wonderful acquisitions together with some just outstanding technology program wins that we've had over those many years.","And where we used to be a safety device company with a little bit of telematics, today, we have a very broad high-technology automotive offering, ranging everything from engine control to antilock braking, to electronic transmission, to high-voltage products, into sensors, starting even to make penetration and things like antennas along with the RF products that we've sold for so many years, and together with hybrid and electric vehicles. And so that breadth that we have into the high-growth content opportunities in the car that has really been for us what has differentiated in terms of our performance.","And geographically, our automotive business has also really transformed from a predominant kind of two-thirds European business to today, a less than half of the business in Europe and really equally spread on the rest between North America and Asia. And when we look at our results in the last quarter, actually, we had really strong performance. For example, in the first quarter coming out of in Asia where there was some talk last year at least in terms of some warning signs in that space. But our team in Asia has just done a fantastic job and we've made a nice acquisition as well last year that positioned us with some of the local manufacturers in Asia.","So I'd just tell you, we continue to grow in our satisfaction with the breadth and the depth of our automotive business. We're still small on any relative and comparable basis, but we certainly are getting more and more than our fair share as things go on.","Matthew Sheerin","Got it. And just another question on FCI, it looks like the results there came in to plan, but there was a disproportionately higher percentage of distribution sales for FCI than there is I know for Amphenol. And there has been talk among other suppliers, particularly the semi-suppliers that inventory correction has largely played out in distribution, there is some refresh going on. Are there signs from FCI's perspective that that's happening?","Adam Norwitt","Yeah. I would just tell you that FCI didn't necessarily see a meaningful inventory \u2013 maybe at the time that everybody else was talking about it. And not surprisingly, they don't see necessarily a correction or a refresh that comes sometimes on the tail of that. So we don't see anything meaningful plus or minus relative to changes in the distribution channel. What we do see and that's for sure is now having owned FCI for just over three months, the relationships, the presence, the discussions that we're having with the distributors have really gone to a next level. And I think that that is just the testament to the strength that FCI had. You correctly point out, roughly 40% of their sales was on distribution, but what's more important is not that 40%, but rather where that 40% resides with the distributors.","We have traditionally been more in the industrial, the aerospace, the harsh environment products with those distributors and FCI takes us much more into the more commercial products, a lot of which end up in embedded computing applications in the industrial space. And I think that's an area really of excitement among all of our distributors. And so we go from maybe a more traditional position with them to a position that is really right in the wheelhouse of many of their strategies.","And I think we really see already the benefits of that in terms of the dialogs that we have had with our distributors and that we continue to have with them. So we thought all along that FCI would be a great asset as it relates to our distribution channel and I can just tell you three months in that that has been clearly confirmed for me.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Mark Delaney","Yes, good afternoon, and thanks very much for taking the question. Questions on the industrial segment. Adam in your prepared remarks you talked about some varied transmission, different portions of industrial. I was hoping you could elaborate a bit more on some of those subsector trends within industrial that you're seeing. And if you could help us reconcile at all some of the differences in indicators we see, there has been some improvement in some of the indices like the ISM index has started to pick up, but there is still quite a bit of volatility at a micro level on the industrial \u2013 from the industrial companies. So any sort of granularity or color you could give us on industrial would be helpful?","Adam Norwitt","Yeah. No. Thank you very much, Mark. Look, I mean, we are not too wedded to all of these micro indicators in the industrial market. I mean, I read the same papers and see some of these things. I think there is no question. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that that is a relative somber overall industrial market. That being said, I can tell you our industrial team is far from somber. And I think the reason is, is we continue to plum for those opportunities that are there. We are not just stuck to things that aren't growing. But as soon as we see that the opportunity is not there, our team is quickly pivoting towards those areas where there are opportunities.","And so we talked about last quarter, one example where we've seen a really great growth out of something like a hybrid bus and truck. We've seen also great growth coming out of alternative energy in areas like new lighting applications. We saw strength in instrumentation in the quarter. Conversely, a market like an oil and gas continues to not be a great place to be and that is what it is. And our team who is involved in oil and gas is doing all the things that you would expect and Amphenol management team to do at a time when sales are down very significantly.","It is just a kind of a microcosm of how we view our business overall within industrial that we drive every day to make sure that we are properly diversified and agile such that we can pivot towards the opportunities that are there in the industrial market. And I think, our team has shown consistently the ability to really fair it out those growth opportunities, wherever they may be.","Mark Delaney","That's helpful. A follow-up question on commodities, there's been some rebound in commodity prices, especially in gold. And can you just talk about to what extent you are starting to see that in your cost structure and if there is something we need to be keeping in mind, as we think about modeling costs going forward?","Craig Lampo","Yeah, I mean, I'll take that. Thanks. Yeah, a good question. I think that as we've said before, there is certainly many contributors to margin. And in terms of the rebound of gold or copper or the other commodities, we've always said that you kind of have to look at the top-line growth opportunities in terms of the marketplace versus the bottom-line from the commodities and other things.","And we haven't seen really a significant \u2013 although certainly a positive commodity environment is helpful, but we haven't seen that significant improvement other than in the cable segment, which I talked about a little bit. I wouldn't say that we would \u2013 I would say that there is a \u2013 we would also see a negative trend right now, based on where the prices are. Certainly if the markets then overall, become more robust in the future and like in 2011 when the commodities had some significant increase, there could be some impact at that point, but we don't see that at this point in time.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Wood from Macquarie Capital. Your line is now open.","Mike Wood","Hi. Good afternoon. Auto remains one of your strong growth markets, curious if you can give us some more color just in terms of what's actually been driving the content and based on your platform visibility, where you see some of the content, if there is maybe one or two areas that you could point to of strong growth there?","Adam Norwitt","Well, good afternoon, Mike. I think I mentioned earlier that we have really broadened our automotive business and we broadened it both from an application, we've broadened it geographically, we've broadened it by customer. I wouldn't point to just one or another application. I mentioned earlier that we've seen solid growth coming out of hybrid electric vehicles. Look, hybrid electric vehicles has been something that people have been talking about for pretty close to a decade now and I would tell you that today that seems to be a bit more of a reality than it was earlier just the prognosis for hybrid electric vehicles. So we're happy to see that, we're happy to see that we continue to win and gain new content.","We've seen a lot of great content in other areas like electronic transmissions for example, that's something I've talked about in the past. It's an area where customers have one of the harshest environment electronic systems in the car, and where there is a unique interconnect requirement, in a very inhospitable part of the car, which is ultimately transmission. And it's part of a category of applications that I would almost refer to as halfway to hybrid because that's one area, whether that's electronic transmissions, whether that's start-stop motors, whether that's engine management control.","These are all areas which allow automakers to improve the fuel efficiency of the car without having to stick a heavy battery and add all of the cost of a hybrid drive into the car. And so I think in general that is one area that's sort of hybrid-ish or half-hybrid area that we have seen good growth and we continue to see good progress with our customers.","Mike Wood","Great. And also can you talk about how you view the diversity target to the company with the acquisition strategy? In terms of having now multiple segments that are approaching 20%, is there a sort of number cut-off where you'd exclude large acquisitions from your pipeline just to maintain the diversity?","Adam Norwitt","Look, we believe that the diversity of the company is a great asset for Amphenol and I think we see it here in the first quarter. We've seen it over recent years, and I think this is really a strategy that is from my perspective really without reproach. Today, we have an outstanding balance across our \u2013 across the various markets with two markets representing 19% of sales, one representing 18%, and a few others in the double-digits.","And I think that balance is really a great asset for the company. But we have had in the past in a given quarter, even in given year, markets be higher than 20% even up in to the mid-20%s, even flirting maybe close to 30%. Is there a bright line that we would have? I wouldn't tell you that there is a bright line, but I would tell you that there are areas \u2013 there are levels where we would not be comfortable and I think that would really mean that one market would have a disproportionate impact on the company. Is that 35%, is that 40%, is that 30%? I mean I think it's hard to pin a number on to it. But I would definitely know it when I saw it.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Steven Fox from Cross Research. Your line is now open.","Steven Fox","Thanks. Good afternoon. Just one question from me, please. Just getting back to the FCI acquisition, you mentioned how you're getting a handle on the distribution strength of the business. My understanding is \u2013 are there sort of product synergies whether its backplane connectors with some of the stuff you do in datacom et cetera. So I was wondering Adam, if you could just talk a little bit about \u2013 I'm sure you're not including sales synergies in your guidance, but the potential for that to ramp and what kind of rough timeline before you could pull some of those synergies together and we could see that in the top-line numbers? Thanks.","Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much, Steve. Look, we are just owning the company now for one quarter. We're very, very pleased with the results here in the first quarter, and I can tell you that there is a lot of activities ongoing across the company. Some of those activities and Craig alluded to them are to get the cost structure in order, and we had significant actions here in the first quarter to do so. But there is other activities, which is to really identify collaborative opportunities for growth. And those collaborative opportunities fall into a few different categories.","One is from a market standpoint, working with customers where we may have a strength with a certain customer in a certain geography and FCI may not or vice-versa. Another may be just into a new market. For example, taking FCI's embedded computing products and seeking to proliferate those into an area like an aerospace, for example, where they didn't have so much presence in the past.","And a third and equally important area is that technology collaboration. And what I can just tell you is here in the first 90-100 days, we have really attacked all of those areas in a very thoughtful way, because at the same time, as you want to be impatient, as you want to get all that stuff done, you have an organization of 7,000 people who have a new family and they need to adjust to that new family. And we're very thoughtful about how we do that, how we bring the people in, what we ask of them, what we drive them. I mean this is not an easy process for someone coming into a company. But the initiatives that we have already, we start to already see the prospect of value creating between us on those incremental initiatives.","When are they going to result in extra sales per se, I think it's too early to pin that on to a day, to a quarter or an outlook. But there is no doubt in my mind that long-term, we will have significant opportunities to realize incremental growth because of those very strong initiatives that are really being embraced across the company.","Steven Fox","Great. I appreciate the color. Good luck.","Adam Norwitt","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian White from Drexel. Your line is now open.","Brian White","Yeah. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about IT and data and how you're thinking about the second half of the year. I wasn't clear, are we expecting organic growth in that area? And second part would be China communications infrastructure, what are you seeing in the comm infrastructure market in China? Thank you.","Adam Norwitt","Thank you very much, Brian. Relative to IT-datacom, I think when I talked about our guidance both at the beginning of the year, as well as just now, we did talk about the fact that while we expect a very strong growth because of FCI, we do expect the market overall on an organic basis to be roughly at the same levels of last year. Now, that does incorporate in the second half some growth compared to the first half. And that's not abnormal in the IT-datacom market and that is really organically growing from the first half to the second half of the year.","And we look forward to that and we feel that that is not only normal, but it is something that should happen, given our real strength with customers. I think the overall IT datacom market is a market that is going through a lot of transition right now; and you see that in some of the public releases that already come out. But you see that really in terms of the shift of power in the industry and, something that I've talked about in the past, that shift of power towards the operators, the service providers and a little bit away from some of the traditional OEMs.","I can tell you that our team and, in particular, our team as it relates to the acquisition of FCI and the breadth of products that we have from FCI has done an outstanding job of ensuring that we take advantage of that shift, as opposed to get injured by that shift; and we're doing a great job to pivot towards some of those new customers.","And so, while our overall outlook for the year for IT datacom is a more muted outlook organically, the strength that we have in that space is going to pay great dividends for us. I mean the reality is, we have a lot of confidence in the importance of that market relative to the interconnect market long-term. This is a market where they're pushing the limits of performance to enable data delivery, whether that be video, voice, or other data forms around the world.","The challenges that customers are facing in that space are significant, and many of those bottlenecks reside in interconnect. I can tell you that's a good recipe to have a good business behind it. When we see customers who struggle with performance and when we can go in and solve those performance problems, that's a great long-term place to be; and we believe very strongly in the importance of the IT datacom market.","Relative to the communications infrastructure market, specifically in China as you discussed, I think I mentioned that in the first quarter we saw good strength in the mobile infrastructure market, in particular from North America and Europe and we didn't yet see that sort of strength building in Asia. It doesn't mean that it's not going to come. I think it's too early to call this year is Asia going to be a helper or a hurter in the mobile infrastructure market. Right now, we continue to have, what I would call, a more prudent outlook. But there is no doubt about it that the growth of mobile data is happening as well in Asia.","And I mentioned in one place in particular, which is India, where we have seen really some beginnings of a build-out and we're capitalizing very well on that. And it won't surprise me if that ultimately spreads to other parts of the region.","Brian White","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Adam Norwitt","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Craig Hettenbach","Great, thanks. Just a follow-up question on automotive, given the increased breadth by geography and following up on your comments of robust growth for 2016. Any differences that you're seeing by geography in terms of the automotive growth?","Adam Norwitt","Yes. I think \u2013 I mentioned that in the first quarter actually we saw our strongest growth coming out of Asia in the automotive space; and we were really pleased to see that. We saw some growth coming out of North America and some maybe a more muted performance coming out of Europe at least in that quarter. I think one quarter is not always perfectly reflective.","I think for the year we continue to see opportunities in all of the geographies in automotive. And it's really great for us, given that we are now a much broader geographical presence in the automotive market; and that is a big change from where we were six years, seven years ago, and we're very pleased to have that position.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. And then as my follow-up on the sensor market and granted you're a relatively new entrant to the space, but just from what you've seen so far after the first couple of acquisitions. Anything you could distinguish in terms of some of the growth drivers in that for those technologies relative to connectors or \u2013 and even go so far as growth rate opportunities?","Adam Norwitt","Sure. Look, we've now been in the sensor market for just over two years. I think it\u2019s two years and a quarter now since we made our first acquisition of GE's Advanced Sensor business. I think originally when we made that acquisition, there was always the question, is sensors naturally a higher growth area than interconnect; and we always said, we certainly don't think it's a lower growth than interconnect. And I haven't changed my opinion.","Is it necessarily higher growth than interconnect? I don't think by definition it is. But is it at least as good of an opportunity as the interconnect market? We think, no doubt about it, which makes some sense when you get down to it. Because every time you have a new application for a sensor, and that's whether it's in automotive, or industrial, or in aerospace, ultimately that sensor has got to connect into the system.","And so, you may have so many new applications in a plane, or a car, or a train, or a bus. Each time you have that new application, that's going to require then some way to get that signal back into the overall system; and that usually is happening through an interconnect product. And so, the reality is the two are not necessarily disconnected in terms of their trends; and we feel very good about that market. I think as we've now gotten a little bit more mature in our experience in the sensor market, and as we've gotten out with more customers, and as we've learned more about the space, we are really excited to be a part of the sensor industry and to have our presence in the sensor industry.","Now, we're still small. There is no question about that. Bigger than we used to be, but smaller than we will be in the future. And I think that we see so many potential growth opportunities in the long-term, either organically or through acquisitions over time. And it is just a really exciting technology space. And it's one that really gets to a lot of the underlying technology trends in the various markets that we serve, whether that's emissions control, or whether that's performance, or autonomous driving, or whether that's more control and more analytics that goes on in industrial equipment. You name it, there is no question about it, sensors have a great future there.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. Thanks for all that color.","Adam Norwitt","Thank you very much, Craig.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of William Stein from SunTrust. Your line is now open.","William Stein","Great. Thank you for squeezing me in. Adam, I was hoping you could spend a minute talking about military end market, ex this DLA issue, and maybe looking towards the back half of this year and into next. There is an expectation among some investors that the sequestration is off, we had the first up DoD budget in maybe seven years. Would Amphenol expect to see an acceleration of growth in this end market? And maybe you can characterize the trends and the projects that are going out in that end market, please?","Adam Norwitt","Sure. Well, thank you very much, Will. Look, if we takeaway this issue that we already talked extensively about and you look at our outlook for the market, which is still to have a positive growth in the military market despite that DLA issue, I think you'll get the answer right there to the question, which is that we do have a positive outlook. And I think that positive outlook speaks to the breadth of presence that we have across the military market, whereby we are really participating on essentially every program in those geographies where we're allowed as a U.S. company to participate. And I think whether that is new airplane platforms, whether that's upgrade communication systems, whether that is new avionics and radars, there is definitely growth opportunity that we see starting in this year and long-term.","Now, is this a snap back or kind of a spike in growth, I would not advocate taking that view of it. But is there really a kind of maybe a more solid footing under the trends of the military market today than there was a couple of years ago? I feel like there is. And you look at our performance even last year in the military market, where we had relatively flat performance in a market where I think you would have thought was overall down, there's no doubt about it that we continue to grow our position in the military market; and that's despite any of the sort of mild regulatory hiccups that may come our way.","So long-term, I think that's a great market to be in. It's a market where we have tremendous presence; and it's a market where there's a lot of innovation around the technologies and around the electronics that are there. We see also in the military market that there is a subtle shift that appears to be happening just more geopolitically; and that subtle shift is that subtle shift away from a more tactical focus, getting a little bit back towards a more strategic focus. And that's a geopolitical topic that you could spend hours to review.","But the net-net of that is that when you get to a more strategic priority in military, the answer very often comes down to new technologies and new systems, and what can be done with radars, with surveillance, with new fighter jets, with new avionic systems, with new communication systems. And so, long-term I think that that will be a great place to be. And our position remains very, very strong there, and we look forward to capitalizing on those trends going forward.","William Stein","Thanks, Adam.","Adam Norwitt","Thank you very much, Will. Well, I think if I understand correctly this was our last question. And I'd like to take the opportunity to wish all of you a very warm and pleasant spring here; and we look forward to speaking to all of you again here in just around 90 days. Thank you very much. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for attending today's conference, and have a nice day"],"2241":["Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) Q1 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call April 26, 2017  1:00 PM ET","Executives","Craig Lampo - CFO","Adam Norwitt - CEO","Analysts","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","Matt Sheerin - Stifel","James Suva - Citi","Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research","William Stein - SunTrust","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley","Tristan Margot - Cowen & Company","Brian White - Drexel","Operator","Hello and welcome to First Quarter Earning Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in listen-only-mode. At the request of the Company, this conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may now begin.","Craig Lampo","Thank you. Good afternoon. My name is Craig Lampo and I am Amphenol\u2019s CFO. I am here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO.","We would like to welcome everyone to our first quarter conference call. Our first quarter 2017 results were just released this morning, and I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends and then we\u2019ll have Q&A. We may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements, please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information.","The Company closed the first quarter with sales of $1.560 billion and diluted EPS of $0.71, meeting the high end of the Company's guidance for sales and EPS by $25 million and $0.04 respectively. Sales were up 8% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currencies compared to the first quarter of 2016. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisition and currency, sales in the first quarter increased 5%. Sequentially, sales were down 6% in U.S. dollar, local currency and organically.","Bringing down sales into our two segments, our Cable segment which comprised 6% of our sales was up 16% from the first quarter of last year, primarily due to the impact of acquisitions. The interconnect business, which comprise 94% of our sales, was up 7% in U.S. dollars from last year and was down 6% compared to last quarter. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minute.","Operating income was $314 million for the first quarter, operating margin was 20.1% in the first quarter of \u201817 compared to the adjusted operating margin of 18.6% in the first quarter of '16, and down 40 basis points from the fourth quarter of \u201816 operating margin of 20.5%. From a segment standpoint, in the Cable segment, margins were 14.2% in the first quarter compared to 13.3% last year. The 90 basis point increase over last reflects leverage on incremental volume.","In the interconnect segment, margins increased to 22.1% in the first quarter compared to last year at 20.6%, reflecting strong operational performance, as well as the higher operating margins of FCI compared to the first quarter of last year. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the Company\u2019s entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster high performance culture -- high performance action oriented culture in which each individual operating unit able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment.","Through the careful fostering for such a culture and the deployment of these strategies to both existing and acquired companies, our management team continues to achieve industry leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance in the future.","Interest expense for the quarter was $19 million compared to $18 million last year, reflecting the impact of higher average debt levels, primarily resulting from the Company\u2019s stock buyback program. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate was 22.8% for the first quarter of \u201817 compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 26.5% in the first quarter of '16. The tax rate for the first quarter of '17 reflects the inclusion of the full cash tax benefit of option exercises and tax provisions as a result of the new accounting standards related to the stock competition which is effective for the Company January 1, 2017.","I would also note that our guidance reflects an expected effective tax rate for the second quarter of approximately 26% and for the full year of approximately 25% to 26%. On a GAAP basis, the Company\u2019s first quarter '16 effective tax rate was 28.75%, which reflects the tax impact of the acquisition related costs incurred during the first quarter of that year.","Net income was a strong 14% of sales in the first quarter of \u201817. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS grew 42% for the first quarter of \u201917 to $0.71 from $0.50 in the first quarter of \u201916 and diluted EPS grew 20% compared to the first quarter of '16 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.59.","Orders for the quarter were $1.599 billion, an increase of 8% over the first quarter of '16, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02:1. The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash; cash flow from operations was $338 million in the quarter or approximately 105% of net income; and the Company continues to target and achieve cash flow from operations in excess of net income.","From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $962 million at the end of March; accounts receivable was approximately $1.3 billion and accounts payable was 682 million at the end of quarter; inventory days, day sales outstanding and payable days were 83, 76 and 59 days respectively, which are all within our normal range.","The cash flow from operations of $238 million along with net borrowings of $225 million and stock option proceeds of $24 million were used primarily; to purchase approximately $249 million of the Company\u2019s stock; to fund dividend payments of $49 million; to fund net capital expenditures of $48 million; and to fund previously reported acquisition of approximately $47 million, which resulted in an increase of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $104 million net of translation.","During the quarter, the Company repurchased 3.7 million shares at an average price of just under $68. These repurchases were made under Company\u2019s $1 billion three-year stock repurchased program that was improved in January. I would also note that the adoption of this new stock compensation standard have the effect of increasing our diluted weighted average shares by approximately 2 million shares.","At March 31st, cash and short-term investments were approximately $1.3 billion, the majority of which is held outside the U.S. Also, at the end of the quarter, the Company had issued $1.2 billion under its commercial paper program and the Company\u2019s cash and availability under our credit facilities totaled approximately $2 billion. As previously announced, the Company had a successful senior note issuance in which the Company issued three and seven year notes aggregating $750 million on April 5th; and the Company intends to use the proceeds to repay all of its outstanding $375 million senior note, which is due this upcoming September, as well as for general corporate purposes.","Prior to the $375 million note maturing, the Company used the net proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program. After considering $750 million senior note, the aggregate cash and availability is approximately $8.8 billion. Total debt at March 31st was approximately $3.2 billion and net debt is approximately $2 billion. In the first quarter of \u201917, EBITDA was approximately $379 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter.","Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends.","Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much, Craig. And I\u2019d like to offer my welcome to all of you on the call here today. It\u2019s a pleasure to speak to all here at the time of our first quarter earnings release. As is customary, I\u2019m going to first highlight some of our achievements in the first quarter; I\u2019ll then go into a little bit more on to the trends and progress across our served markets; and then finally I\u2019ll close with some comments on our outlook for the second quarter and the full year and of course we\u2019ll have time for questions at the end.","With respect to the first quarter, we\u2019re very pleased that our results in the quarter were stronger than expected. We exceeded the high-end of our guidance in sales and earnings, and delivered what clearly a robust start for 2017. Craig mentioned our revenues increased by 8% in U. S. dollars and 5% organically, reaching that $1.560 billion level. And we\u2019re encouraged, in particular that bookings were strong, orders of $1.6 billion and that was a book-to-bill of 1.02:1.","I think one thing we\u2019re really proud of is the increase in operating margins in the quarter, they increased 150 basis points from prior year to 20.1% and this is an excellent achievement by the entire organization. We talked about last year our quarter-over-quarter growth and we\u2019re just really pleased to see that the year-over-year improvement in the profitability of FCI was just reflected in this substantial margin improvement. And obviously, those earnings convert to cash and operating cash flow with a very strong $238 million. So in summary, I\u2019m just very proud of our team and once again the discipline and the agility of routine, it clearly reflected in the Company\u2019s great start here in 2017.","Now, turning to our served market, to say that we remain very pleased with the breadths and balance of the Company\u2019s end markets; and given the ongoing dynamics is in the global electronic market, and I\u2019ll just say, the global economy at large, this balance across our market remains just a tremendous asset for the Company. Starting out with the military market, the military market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased from prior year by a very significant 14% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically. As we recovered from last year\u2019s DLA stop shipment and also realized growth across virtually every segment of the military market, our growth in the quarter was strongest as in space, vehicles, communications and ordinance related applications. But as I said, we really did see growth across the board and the military market.","Sequentially, our sales were down as expected by about 5% from the fourth quarter. And as we look into the second quarter, we expect sales in the military market to increase slightly from their current levels and for the full year 2017, we continued to expect growth in the low to mid single digits. I'll just say that we\u2019re very encouraged by our robust outlook in the military market and our strong performance in the quarter. Our team working in this important market has done just a truly phenomenal job, reaffirming our leadership position in the market while capitalizing on the many opportunities to leverage the Company's leading technology position on new military electronics. And we look forward to continuing to build on this position of strength as we move into the future.","The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales are down slightly from prior year the volumes of helicopter and business jets, in particular, have not yet recovered. Sequentially, sales are flat with the fourth quarter, which was a bit softer than we had expected coming into the quarter, as overall procurement volumes for commercial aircraft stabilized following recent ramp ups of new programs.","Looking into the second quarter, we expect a small increase from these levels. And for the full year 2017, we now expect a single digit increase from prior year. Despite the slight moderation demand in this quarter, I'll just tell you that we remain very encouraged by the Company's strong overall position around the world in the commercial end market. Our team in this market is continuing to broaden the Company's range of product in support of the revolution of new electronics in next generation airplane. And we look forward to capitalizing on our standing technology for many years to come.","The industrial market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew 9% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency. As we benefited from several of our acquisitions completed last year, as well as from positive organic performance, in particular, in the instrumentation, heavy equipment and factory automation segment. Our sales in total grew by 4% organically from prior year.","Sequentially, sales in the industrial market were slightly down from the fourth quarter due to typical seasonality. As we now look into the second quarter, we expect sales to increase from these levels as we capitalize on our broad technological strength across the many various segments of the worldwide industrial market. And for the full year 2017, we continue to expect sales growth in the low to mid single digits.","With respect to industrial market, we like many others, are certainly hopeful that the U.S. and other countries around the world begin to shift spending priorities toward necessary upgrades to infrastructure. At this point, however, it remains too early to predict whether this will indeed happen. Nevertheless, we\u2019re confident that Amphenol is well positioned to capitalize on any such initiatives should they materialize. And in fact, I\u2019ll just say that our teams who work in the global industrial market, continue to do an outstanding job of broadening our leading range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products to position us to capture opportunities for growth wherever they may arrive across the industrial market.","The automotive market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter, and we delivered another strong quarter in the automotive market. Sales increased by 10% in U.S. dollars, 12% in local currency and 11% organically with strong growth really in all regions. Sequentially, our automotive sales increased somewhat, just a slight bit from the fourth quarter, but which was a better than we had expected.","We remain excited by our excellent and growing position in the automotive market. Our continually expanding range of interconnect products, including discrete connectors and complex interconnect assemblies, as well as our growing array of sensors together with our emerging offering of vehicle antennas, positions us to take advantage of the multitude of opportunities to enable new electronics in cars. Whether in traditional fuel powered, hybrid or electric vehicles, we see car makers around the world integrating advanced electronics into virtually every function in the automobile. And this creates an outstanding long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol. Looking into the second quarter, we expect sales in the automotive market to again grow from current levels. And for the full year 2017, we continue to expect sales growth in the mid to high single digits.","The mobile devices market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter, and as we expected coming into the quarter, our sales were down from the fourth quarter by a little bit over 20% sequentially due to the first quarter seasonality. Compared to the prior year, our sales were down by 18%, as significantly softer sales of products incorporated into tablets and smartphones were only partially offset by increases related to laptops and wearables. In the face of the significant down turn in demand, our team once again exercised their incredible agility in reacting to the volatility that\u2019s ever present in the mobile devices market.","And meanwhile, we've not slowed our efforts in pursuit of a broad array of new design opportunities on a wide range of mobile devices. All well ensuring that regardless of these volume reductions, the Company still drives strong financial performance. As we look into the second quarter, we do expect a strong double digit sequential increase in our sales as we benefit from new product ramp ups. For the full year, however, we still do not expect our sales to grow from 2016 levels.","Regardless of our muted demand outlook for this year, we remain extremely confident that our experienced and agile team has positioned us to benefit and take advantage of any opportunities that may arise in this dynamic mobile devices market. The mobile networks market represents 9% of our sales in the quarter. And as expected, sales were down slightly from prior year as operators pause their investments in new wireless systems. Sequentially, sales declined by 7% again as we have expected from the fourth quarter.","We have recently seen some wireless operator moderate their spending outlooks in the near term. And accordingly, while we expect sales in the second quarter to increase a bit from first quarter levels, we do now expect the low to mid single digit decline in sales in the mobile networks markets for the full year of 2017.","Despite this somewhat more modest outlook, we remain confident in the Company\u2019s strong position across the mobile networks market. We continue to build out our leading portfolio of interconnect products and antennas, while expanding our partnerships with OEMs and service providers around the world. In addition, we are encouraged by several new discussions of new network investments that are planned in the coming years, and we look forward to taking advantage of those.","With the acceleration of video and data traffic that\u2019s going through mobile networks, together with increasing demands by consumers for better coverage, Amphenol is well positioned to capitalize on any growth and spending that may occur in this important market. The information technology and data communications market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter. And we had another outstanding quarter in IT datacom. Our sales increased by greater than expected 25% in U.S. dollars, which included a very strong 21% organic growth. Sequentially, sales were down by a bit less than expected just 5% due to the normal seasonality that we see in the first quarter in this market.","Just want to say that our team working in the IT datacom market has simply done an outstanding job, leveraging our next generation products to take advantage of growth opportunities across this very important market. In particular, we\u2019re very pleased that our industry leading high speed and power product portfolio is being adopted by OEMs as well as cloud service providers as they upgrade their networks to deal with the continued rapid expansion of data traffic. As we look into the second quarter, we expect sales to stay at these robust levels. And for the full year 2017, we now expect sales growth in the mid to high single digits for the IT datacom market.","The broadband market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter and sales increased from prior year by 11%, driven by the benefits, in particular, from the All Systems broadband acquisition that we made at the end of last year. Sequentially, sales were a bit softer than we had expected and were flat to prior quarter. For the second quarter, we expect sales to increase from these levels and for the full year, we continue to expect low double digit growth, supported by the All Systems Broadband acquisition, as well as by our organic efforts to expand with customers around the world.","We\u2019re very pleased with our position in the broadband market, and we look forward to realizing the benefits of our expanded product offering in support of customers who are delivering data, video and voice to consumers and businesses around the world. We remain mindful that in the broadband market there is always the potential for further consolidation among operators around the world and sometimes that consolidation can result in pauses in capital investments. But nevertheless, as we look into 2017, we are optimistic for a positive spending environment this year and beyond.","So just in summary, I want to say that we\u2019re extremely pleased with the Company\u2019s strong start to 2017. And while the global market environment remains uncertain, the Amphenol organization is executing extraordinarily well and expanding our market position while strengthening the Company's financial performance. Our superior performance is a direct reflection of the Company's distinct competitive advantages; our leading technology; our increasing position with customers across the diverse array of markets; our worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure, a highly effective acquisition program and all underpinned with our agile entrepreneurial management team.","Now, turning to our outlook. And based on the continuation of the current uncertain economic environment and assuming constant exchange rates, we now expect in the second quarter and for the full year 2017 the following results. For the second quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1.580 billion to $1.620 billion and earnings per share in the range of $0.70 to $0.72 respectively. This represents a sales and diluted EPS increase versus prior year of 2% to 5% and 8% to 11%. For the full year 2017, we expect sales in the range of $6.405 billion to $6.525 billion, and EPS in the range of $2.91 to $2.97. For the full year, this represents sales and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 2% to 4% and 7% to 9% respectively over 2016 levels.","On an organic basis, this represents full year sales growth of 1% to 3%. We\u2019re very encouraged by the Company\u2019s strong guidance and robust start to 2017. And I remain extremely confident in the ability of Amphenol\u2019s outstanding management team to build upon this robust start by continuing to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position and at the same time, deliver strong financial performance in 2017 and beyond.","And with that, operator, it\u2019d be our pleasure to take whatever questions there maybe.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Wamsi Mohan","Adam, I was wondering, given some of the changes that we\u2019re seeing in the political landscape. In light of that, would you say that you\u2019re perceiving that there might be larger opportunities here from a military, aerospace and market demand trend? And secondarily on the industrial side, we\u2019re hearing of a level of restock that is occurring within the channel. I was wondering if you could comment, if you\u2019ve seen any trends that would support or renegade that view. Thank you.","Adam Norwitt","Look, I am not going to be the one to guess, which way political winds are blowing. I would be surprised if we\u2019re the number one story of today, though. Currently, there is lots of other announcements to come out. With respect to military aerospace, I have been talking as you know very well Wamsi for quite some time about a trend that we have been seeing in the military market; and I think in the geopolitical environment, overall, which is that we believe that there is a transition from a more technical military stance to a more strategic military stance.","Whereby the spending priorities of the U.S., which have been much more towards dealing with unseen enemies and unseen priorities which is very technical responsive thing, I have seen to migrate more and more towards a more strategic imperative.","And as we said all along, as this more strategic imperative takes over in the military market, whether that\u2019d be with new enemies or resurgent enemies that our country or our allies may have that that ultimately, we believe, leads to more investments and technology. And at the end of the day, the technological developments in the military are some of the things that can truly have an impact on the strategic priorities. And we just remain very, very well positioned for that. We are -- we continue to be the leader in military interconnect product. We continue to be a true partner for our customers as they seek to develop new enabling technologies.","And I think the results that we saw this quarter and frankly even last year, despite having had the DLA issue a year ago, we remain having last year\u2019s strong organic growth in the military market and we expect the same this year. What the long-term opportunity will be, that\u2019s very hard for me to predict here now. But what I can tell you is, regardless of what it will be, Amphenol will be there is support of the technological requirements of militaries around the world. As it relates to industrial market and whether there is a restocking that is occurring there, I wouldn\u2019t tell you that we have necessarily seen tangible evidence of restocking per se. I think we\u2019re pleased with the performance in our distribution channel. But as you know, distribution represents for us somewhat less than 15% of our overall sales. So we may not be necessarily the best bellwether to determine whether or not there is in fact such a restocking.","The industrial market for us performed very well in the quarter. And I think I called out in my remarks that some of those areas have strength that we saw, in particular, areas like factory automation, have equipment, instrumentation; we saw also strength in places like medical, even in the area like the marine market. And one thing I would point out in industrial, even if we had for a couple of years a down turn in oil and gas, which has put significant pressure on overall industrial sales; we were very pleased this quarter for the first quarter in many to see a sequential increase in our oil and gas sales. And I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s a restocking at a distribution level, but at least it\u2019s a sign that may be one can smell a bottom there.","Operator","Thank you. For our next question, this comes from the line of Mark Delaney. Your line is open.","Mark Delaney","First question is on mobile devices market, Adam you talked about some about some product launches helping sales to increase double digit sequentially in the June quarter. Can you comment on what sorts of applications does that tablets or something else that is driving the pick-up in the June quarter in mobile devices? And then as you think about the full year, can you just help characterize what your expectations are for Amphenol to be able to participate in flagship product launches for smartphones later this year? And if that does come to fruition, what would that mean relative to your full year guidance in mobile devices?","Adam Norwitt","I'm not going to comment in specific programs or product launches. I\u2019ll tell you that we work in a broad array of different products in the mobile devices market. And as we look into the second quarter, I think we see also a broad array of different products which -- where we start to see the launch cycles happening. In terms of flagship products, again I'm not going to comment specifically on that, but we have good position across customers in the mobile devices market. At the same time, we've embedded into the guidance that we see and we continue to see this year to be a flat year in mobile devices.","All what we know about the product launches that we\u2019re involved in at this stage, it\u2019s a very volatile market. I just would reemphasize that that predicting ultimately what products gets released at what times and what consume and which product sale to which consumer at which volume. This remains a task that is far beyond our expertise. And what we continue to do with that business in the way that we continue to manage that business is to be ready regardless. And the readiness that our team exhibit is both on the downside and the up side, and I think we've seen that this quarter the ability to flex the organization to not sacrifice the work that we're doing with customers to design in our products, regardless of the fact that we saw significant sequential and a year-over-year reduction in our sales.","And all along the way, clearly, to preserve operating performance, else we wouldn\u2019t be having the overall margins that we have in the Company. And similarly, should there be an opportunity for upside, if it comes in a typically very unpredictable fashion, I can tell you that our team will be ready to capitalize on that to the full extent at the level of the opportunity.","Mark Delaney","And then for a follow up question, seems like a bit on the capital allocation of the Company -- the Company has operated in a 0.5 to 1.5 turns of net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio recently, you talked about the senior note financing and doing some more on the buybacks. Can you just talk about your leverage tolerance? And as you think about potential M&A, would you be willing to increase the leverage ratios versus where the Company has operated at in last several years?","Craig Lampo","I think with regards the Company's capital deployment this really hasn\u2019t changed over the years. And we continue to have a consistent and flexible and balanced approach to this where we have about long term about half of our capital will be deployed to share -- return it to shareholders regarding the dividends in our share repurchase program that we announced earlier this year as a continuation of that. We did repurchased 3.7 million shares in the quarter. Certainly, that varies from quarter-to-quarter depending on cash needs and what not. But we feel certainly very good about that and very good about that deployment.","In terms of our leverage ratio, I would tell that we\u2019re very happy. We have been in that 0.5 to 1.5, roughly 1, 1.3; I think we ended the quarter in this period. The Company continues to generate a significant amount of cash. And I think what I would tell is that if I were to look upon what we would be willing to go to from a M&A seem to come about that we want to do, I would say maybe 2 to 2.5 range would be something we would be comfortable with; with certainly the thought in mind that we have a very prudent approach to that and we certainly value our investment grade ratings, so we wouldn\u2019t do anything to be end of that. But I think 2.5 would be something that I would be -- we would be comfortable with. So I think that we\u2019re very comfortable with the cap that Company continues to generate a significant amount of cash flow. And certainly, we continue to do that in the first quarter of this year.","Operator","Thank you. For our next question, this comes from the line of Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Amit Daryanani","Couple of questions from me as well, I guess Adam, maybe just out, but the IT datacom market. I think the second quarter in a row you guys have had 20% plus organic growth here, I don\u2019t think IT spends were anywhere close to that. So can you just talk about what is driving the strength for you guys? And importantly, could you sustain this growth potentially throughout 2017 but the compares really don\u2019t get difficult than the December quarter, I think?","Adam Norwitt","We\u2019re very pleased with the performance over the course of the last two quarters in the IT datacom market. I mean in fact if you look at what we did last year, we grew 11% organically for the year. You\u2019re correct we grew I think it was close to 29% organically in the fourth quarter, and we just grew 21% organically in this quarter. Are we going to keep growing at that rate, well I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve necessarily guided to that level. I think I mentioned that we expect for the IT datacom market to grow this year in the mid to high single digits, which is actually a little bit higher than we had expected coming into the year. We remained very attentive and ready to capitalize on whatever opportunities will come our way.","Ultimately, our outperformance has come really from two aspects. One is just a breadth of high technology leading edge products and that was enhanced so much through the FCI acquisition; a breadth of products that become really a one stop shop for customers when they need their equipment to perform better. And I think that that technology that we offer in the IT datacom market is really second to none; when you think about the range of products in high speed, the power products and the whole array of things that are used in IT datacom, also they go into servers and store system to networking appliances and data centers and all the equipment associated with ultimately powering the internet, is where our products are ending up.","So I think that\u2019s very important aspect. And I think the second has been just the ability of our team in working the IT datacom market to quickly pivot to where the opportunities are. And this is not a new concept that I have spoken about it many times. So when we see these results, I think that really is a great testament to our people following the opportunity. And not just resting on your one field going to the same customer that you\u2019ve been going for decades and decades, but rather quickly steering and pivoting toward those customers where the real opportunity is. And that is not an easy task. It is something that we demand of our people and that our people demand of themselves. But it's certainly not easy going to change what you have been doing and to say; I am going to start knocking on the door of someone new; I am going to understand the whole new market; I am going to understand the whole new way of doing business with those customers, which is entirely different from maybe what you are doing in the past.","And I just give a lot of credit to our for the flexibility and agility. Words that I used frequently, proud of Amphenol, Amphenolean, really reacting to where that opportunity is. And then taking advantage of that very first thing I mentioned, which is the breath of the technologies. And ultimately, if you can get the right product, the people who want to get it at the right time, it's not a bad way to win in business.","Amit Daryanani","And then Craig, if I could just follow up on some of the changes in stock auction resulted in the numbers and will run a little bit. Is it fair to think at least on the tax line, the tax rate still early 26.5 but these discreet things are lowered by about 100 basis points for the year. And then the share count creep up, was that just a one-off thing in the March quarter true up thing? Or does that happen throughout the year as well?","Craig Lampo","So with regard to the tax rate I would tell you that there is obviously a lot of things that impact tax rate over the course of time. And as Adam referenced before, we\u2019re sitting here in a day that we were I think some tax reform things may be coming out and certainly who knows what's going to happen with the tax rate for all companies going forward. But I would tell you that the primary impact certainly in this quarter and in our outlook for the full year is the impact that its adoption in terms of putting into our guidance some impact of that.","So in regards to the share count, I would tell you that the increase of $2 million shares that I referenced is something that's kind of a permanent increase that happened in the quarter. It really relates to how the amount of shares that you could buy back as it relates to the options exercised in this, all the treasury stock methods effect as calculated and what it does essentially, is increased the share count as relate to that. So for us is how the impact of increasing it by 2 million shares, which you can effectively model and for -- going forward from a comparability perspective.","Operator","Thank you. For our next question, this comes from the line of Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sherri Scribner","You guys are seeing very high operating margins above the 20% range. And typically 20%, 8.5 is really the high point for you. But if I look at the full year guidance it suggests that operating margins will be at least 20.5%, which suggest an improvement in operating margins in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. Can you give us a little bit of detail that what\u2019s driving that and do you still see the same contribution margin for your business going forward?","Adam Norwitt","Yes, I think we\u2019re actually very proud certainly of our operating performance in the first quarter at 20.1%, 40 basis points reduction on the 6% decrease in sales, is something that we\u2019re certainly proud of. But I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s out of the normal range of our conversion on down decline in sales, we think further around 27% on a decline. We\u2019ve talked about over the long-term that 25% conversion margin is our targeted conversion margin from an organic perspective. And I think if you look sequentially in our guidance what you find it that we\u2019re guiding to a little bit higher than that, but not so dramatically higher than that.","But I will tell you that there is any change in terms of our long-term strategy that 25% conversion margin, it does vary from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter. But I think that is still something that we target long-term. And more recently, we\u2019ve done a good job I think of executing operationally to do just a little bit better than that; so certainly, we\u2019re very proud of that. And I would say that there would be higher ROF in the second half just due to those increased sales levels that would essentially convert as that higher conversion margin.","Sherri Scribner","And then can you maybe give a little detail on what you\u2019re seeing from a currency perspective. GE saw a little bit of benefit versus the prior expectations from FX this morning when they reported. We\u2019ve heard mix messages on FX from other companies. Maybe you can give us some detail on how much FX impacted your changing guidance? Thanks.","Adam Norwitt","So the first \u2013 so when we gave guidance in January, I think the biggest two currencies that changed, euro change a bit. But not dramatically since we gave guidance in January, and actually the renminbi came down a bit. So I would tell you that from a full year perspective versus our prior guidance, there really wasn\u2019t so much of a benefit. There was a slight benefit but we\u2019re talking negligible amount at this. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily -- we didn\u2019t call out and I wouldn\u2019t call out as anything of significance for the year. I\u2019m not sure what other people guided to in terms of what rates they were using. But for us that\u2019s what I would talk about.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question, this comes from line of Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is open.","Matt Sheerin","So Adam just wanted to get a little bit more color on the automotive market. You gave fairly robust guidance for the year in mid to high-single-digits. That does imply though a bit of a deceleration in the back half, but still strong growth and looks like above some of your competitors. And of course we\u2019re running into tough comps in the back half with China. But you did talked about growth drivers across not just your interconnect products but sensors and antennas. So what\u2019s your general outlook not just for the market but in terms of your content growth opportunity?","Adam Norwitt","Look, the other market has brought a really great driver over a number of years and that\u2019s no different here in the first quarter. We\u2019re just really pleased to see this double-digit organic growth, the continuation of the trend that we\u2019ve seen for number of years. I think your math is right that if we\u2019re going 11% organically and then I guide to mid to high single digit that would arithmetically imply that there is some slightly lower growth in the second half. And as usual, we're guiding really to what we see today.","We don\u2019t -- may be a little bit differently than other companies; we don\u2019t necessarily look at overall vehicle unit volumes and extrapolate from that in our own business. We think about the opportunities that we're pursuing with our customers and what our customers are telling us about those opportunities. And often times that really is, not tide to vehicle volumes, but more by the implantation of new systems and cars. And I can just tell you that as Craig and I travel around the world and we visit with our operations, working in automotive markets as I visit customers who are participating in that market. Just the unbelievable array of new functionalities that are being adopted into cars and that\u2019s a lot of people talk about electric cars or hybrid cars, diesel, there is always parsing of different categories of cars.","But I think about it a little bit differently, just all cars are getting more electronics no matter what. And that\u2019s just seeming one way ratchet upwards. And so the job of our teams that\u2019s working in the automotive market is to make sure that they can harness our technological capabilities, which have broaden very significantly over the recent really half decade. And ensure that we are participating and gaining more than our fair share of those new electronic systems that are being put into cars.","That\u2019s easy for me to say, there is a lot of hard work behind that from our people really in the field, designing the products and executing on those new systems. But there is just no doubt about it that the number of systems being put into cars is expanding regardless of the category of the car and regardless of the overall unit volumes in the car. I think we did talk last year at the end of the year about some strength that we had seen in particular at year end in Asia and I think we weren\u2019t the only company to talk about that.","We\u2019re very pleased actually this quarter that our growth was quite balanced. I think we saw little bit stronger performance in Europe, but I would say just a little bit strong in the other two regions we\u2019re also growing in a very robust fashion. And I think as we look out over the course of the year, we would expect to see may be that same balance and that does compare to end of last year where it was little more levered towards Asia growth towards the end of the year. And again is that because of subsidies or because of whatever, I can\u2019t tell you that we\u2019re close enough to the various government policies to know whether those subsidies are going to continue or not continue.","But at the end of day, it is about us gaining more position on a broader array of electronic systems that are being implemented on a broader array of cars. It is just amazing, I mean I went car shopping not so long ago and I feel like I need to take my teenage son with me to car shop, because he knows how to work the computers now better than I do. I guess it\u2019s a sign of me getting old. So that is what it is but these cars are just unbelievable data centers on wheels now where that didn\u2019t used to be the case. And I think that\u2019s a great opportunity for Amphenol and it\u2019s a great opportunity for our industry and one that we fully expect to take full advantage of, going forward.","Operator","Thank you very much. For our next question, this comes from the line of James Suva of Citi. Your line is open.","James Suva","A clarification question and then a more detailed follow up, the clarification question, when you mentioned the stock number -- diluted outstanding share number that went up, you mentioned that that was a permanent step up. What you meant and going forward, did you mean that every single quarter we should expect that step up or you're just saying from this level continuing on? I wasn\u2019t sure if you meant it continues to keep stepping up every quarter. And then my follow up question was more about your year, I think you said organic growth rate of 1% to 3%. And I think this quarter organically was about 5%, help me bridge the difference between the big deceleration if I got my math wrong?","Adam Norwitt","Jim thanks for the question. And to clarify, it is a one-time step up that stays consistent, going forward. And with respect to the organic growth question Jim, I think we talked a lot about this at our last quarter's call that we see what we see at the beginning of the year, we work in a very volatile -- we are working in a market that has its level of volatility to it in particular in certain of our markets. And we believe that given the rate of markets that we\u2019re in that this is a very prudent but also a very strong guidance.","Now, again, doing the same arithmetic that you\u2019re doing if we grow 5% organically in the first quarter, that would imply that there must be another that\u2019s below that 1% to 3% level; and I think again, the arithmetic is correct there, but no doubt about it. It doesn\u2019t change our view of the year that we continue to see this as a year where we can grow organically at 1% to 3%. But where our team will remain singularly fixated on capitalizing on any opportunities that there may be to do better than that and I think we did better than that here in the first quarter and we\u2019re very pleased that we started the year strong, we came into the quarter with an expectation not to get to that 5% organic growth and we did it and we\u2019re going to keep fighting our way to do that as much as we can.","Operator","Thank you. For our next question, this comes from the line of Shawn Harrison from Longbow Research.","Shawn Harrison","Two part are on mobile if I may, one on devices one infrastructure business; first on infrastructure. Adam, maybe if you could describe where may be which region you\u2019ve seen the pull back in activity? And then second on the device business. Are you walking away from any content opportunities, are you pulling out of any devices beyond just what you\u2019ve seen in some of the tablet, smartphone weakness out there?","Adam Norwitt","I think with your first question on infrastructure, I think in the quarter, in the first quarter, Europe performed a bit better than Asia and North America. And I think that we would expect in our guidance for that to be the case, and I think we\u2019ve seen a little bit probably more North America in terms of some of the expectations pulling back. Again, these are not huge numbers. As I said, I think, we came into last quarter, thinking it's going to be flat now we think it's may be low single digit, low to mid single digit down. So that\u2019s not an enormous change in our outlook, but it' a little change and we want to share that with everybody.","We\u2019re going to stay very mindful. It's a market where the predictions are not as easy to make in wireless infrastructure because the capital spending sometimes happens without necessarily so much warning to supplier and to everybody. And so we\u2019re just going to continue doing what we\u2019ve always done in that market. And that to make sure that we\u2019re positioning ourselves with our broad range of interconnect and antenna products, across OEMs and operators, across every reason where we can participate.","And in our experience the better job we do of doing that the more able we are to capitalize on the spending when it does come. And I think we have a very strong position here. We had a great year last year in mobile networks, a year where we didn\u2019t necessarily anticipated coming in and where ultimately we grew 9% organically and 24% last year with the impact of the acquisitions, in particular FCI. And so as we approach that market right now, we\u2019re going to stay very mindful of any opportunities that will come our way. And we\u2019ve got a great set of people and a great set of products to pursue in that area.","As it relates to mobile devices, we don\u2019t adopt a strategy really in any of our business from quote on quote walking away from business, that\u2019s not been our approach. But as you know, our consistent approach in mobile devices is to participate where we have value for our customers. And so that comes just naturally where when customers decide that there is not a value embedded in the product that you sell then we may not participate because we won't be able to make the returns that we would otherwise make from the new round of things. So we\u2019re never walking away from existing platforms; we\u2019re never discontinuing products or discontinuing customer relationships; again, that\u2019s just not the way that we approach this high speed and high volatility market that there is.","As we think about the guidance that we have here, I think I mentioned we saw in the first quarter in particular weaker performance in tablets that\u2019s not a new phenomenon, it's something that we\u2019ve been talking about for the better part of the last three four quarters. And we would expect that to continue; there just seems to be material and systematic consumer shift away from tablet and towards other devices, either handsets or smaller laptops. And the prospects of tablets to me at least it seem to as terrific as they once were. And for us it is what is; we\u2019re going to continue to design in our products; we\u2019re going to continue to work with customers across every aspect of that. And I think the success that we\u2019ve had in an area like wearables where we actually did grow in wearables quite significantly on a year-over-year basis, which was certainly nowhere near enough to offset the downturn in tablets and some that we saw in handsets. But it's just a great recognition of the fact that our team is quickly tacking towards where there is opportunity and where there is value that can be embedded in those products.","And that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to continue to approach the market; we\u2019re not walking away from anything; we\u2019re not changing our strategy; we\u2019ve a very consistent approach and it's an approach that served us very well through second thin and we\u2019ve had years where we\u2019ve been flat; we\u2019ve had years where we\u2019ve been up and we\u2019ve had years where we\u2019ve been down. And I think that\u2019s second nature to the type of market that you\u2019re dealing with in mobile devices. And so we\u2019re still very committed to market; we\u2019re very committed to investing in the products in the market and with the customers in that market; and we\u2019ll be a partner for our customers in everywhere where our technology can make a difference in their products.","Operator","Thank you. For our next question, this comes from the line William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is open.","William Stein","I wanted to address one of the earlier comments about somewhat higher than typical conversion margins in the back half of the year based on the guidance. And I wonder if that\u2019s being helped by mix or specifically by your sensor business or is this something else going on and is this drop through higher level of incremental margins permanent change in the model?","Adam Norwitt","I would tell you that there is nothing specific that we recall out, it certainly is the market mix; we\u2019re converting into the second half on higher volumes, not so much differently than we did on an organic sales last year; and I think we\u2019ve just been operating executing well from an operational perspective over the last year or so; may be better in certain areas. But I would tell you that there is a whole bunch of different factors that go into be able to convert at these levels and for talking 25% versus 30%; we\u2019re not talking significant changes in his conversion. So I would tell you that longer term, as I mentioned to Sherri, I wouldn\u2019t think about this as a permanent chain that we\u2019re going to continue to convert at these really high -- 30% or so margins going forward on higher sales.","But certainly, there is some quarters where we will convert at these high levels. And I\u2019m sure depending on the environment that we\u2019re in, whether or not commodity environments have an impact or different pricing environments have an impact or what not, there could be certain periods where we convert lower than that 25%. But I think the team has done a great job of balancing the factors in the environment that they\u2019re in at the moment and has been able to convert at a little bit higher level than really our long-term goal and certainly we\u2019re very proud of that accomplishment.","William Stein","One follow-up if I can, it seems like this hasn\u2019t been the theme through earnings. But intra-quarter, we were getting signals from distribution that it sounded like there were some shortages and stretching lead times, and there is at least one well known semiconductor company that issues letters periodically and needed this quarter. I\u2019m wondering if you saw that in any of your end markets or businesses this quarter accelerating demand that caused shortages. Or for that matter, in complementary products like passes that might have limited your customers\u2019 interest to take product, because of availability of the complementary products?","Adam Norwitt","Well, I mean we\u2019ve heard and probably read the same thing that you have read. I can tell you that we haven\u2019t seeing shortages in our industry per se. And I haven\u2019t seen any at least tangible indication of shortages driving our customers to not procure as much of our product as they otherwise would have intended. But we have certainly heard about some stretching lead times, I think where I\u2019ve heard it most acutely, has been in areas like memory and NAND and DRAMs and things like that. And we\u2019re of course mindful of that.","I know we have a lot of customers and I can sometimes tell by where our procurement trends are spending their time as to what is running short at a given time. And so it\u2019s on the basis of where I\u2019ve seen some people spending their time, I guess that would indicate that some of those rumors or things like memory shortages and otherwise may in fact be true. But I have yet to see again in instance where these shortages are doing anything in terms of limiting demand by our customers.","Certainly, have heard a lot about pricing and there is a lot of discussion in the industry around pricing of certain semiconductors and the frustration that many of the OEMs are having around those price -- the price increases that they\u2019re seeing. But this has not translated, as far as we can see, into any changes in the demand for our products in terms of their complementary position on various systems of our customers.","Operator","Thank you. For our next question, this comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open.","Steven Fox","Just real quickly, Adam, you mentioned antennas again this time with industrial. I was just curious, if you could talk about what kind of applications you\u2019re now expanding into with the industrial antennas? And then I had a quick follow-up.","Adam Norwitt","Sure. Look, we\u2019re really proud of our antenna business overall. We started out as antenna manufacture in mobile devices and phones, and its early to say, and we\u2019re coming flow, I guess nearly being two decades as an antenna suppliers. So it\u2019s hard to call it a new business for us anymore. But over the years, our teams who work in antennas whether that was in the device side or on the infrastructure side where we\u2019ve also been present for nearly a decade and half. Our team has done the classic Amphenol saying and that is looked to diversify the business.","From where you start out you take that technology and you try to diversify it. And I think industrial automotive and other areas have been just a real great opportunity to start to build some businesses around antennas. So in industrial, we're working in areas like police and safety; we're working in ship borne applications; we're very active in things like what's called I guess broadly the industrial Internet of Things; and what is a little bit of well worn clich\u00e9. But ultimately it talks about the increasing the connectivity or the connected capabilities of industrial equipments overall.","And in order to increase that connected capability one typically has to have an antenna, one typically has to have some interconnect products, and one typically has to have some sensors. And I think our present as a designer and a manufacturer and a provider of all three of those very complimentary products, which we all consider ultimately interconnect, is really putting us in a very strong position for that whole IoT or IIoT revolution that is there. So we're going to continue to invest heavily in our antenna business.","So I mentioned as well that we\u2019re starting to see some better progress in automotive antenna as automotive antennas get more complicated and as they require more knowledge to support things like autonomous driving and 5G technology. These are all areas where we see a greater opportunity for that entire radio frequency interconnect system that includes connectors, cable, assembly cable, antennas and all that goes in amidst that whole system. And it\u2019s something we're going to continue to drive as a real leader in this industry.","Steven Fox","And then just really quickly, capital spending for this year, I was curious if you can give us a range and whether your comfort level with your current footprint whether you might be considering expanding anywhere, in particular. Thanks.","Craig Lampo","From a capital spending prospective, it really hasn\u2019t changed. I think our range is 2% to 4% and we've done within that range over the longer term. I think last year may around 3% plus or minus a couple 10 basis points or so. So I think the 2% to 4% range is the way I would think about our capital spending, which again is consistent with historic spending.","Adam Norwitt","And relative to our footprint, Steve, I would just say we're always looking at expanding or changing or moving or doing something with our footprint. You know very well as you follow the Company for so many years that we take an approach in our manufacturing footprint of really preserving as much as we can flexibility in that footprint; by trying as best as we can to have leases of the building; by not having huge centralized facilities; and thereby having the ability to be able to move factories when we need to move then for whatever reason possible.","And over the years, we've moved production for lots of reasons; to reduce cost; to accommodate customer needs; to deal with changes in regulations; to deal with changes in the cost of freight; to deal with currency, you name it. There is a whole range of things that can come out to you as a manufacturing company and the better that we can preserve the manufacturing flexibility within Amphenol, the more rapidly we can adapt and actually take advantage of changes when they come our way.","And so are we looking to expand our footprint, I think in the last quarter we have certainly opened a few new facilities, and we\u2019ve probably moved one or two at the same time. We have a lot of facilities around the world that you can see it in our 10-K I think we\u2019re somewhere around north of 200 facilities worldwide. And there is always some movement going somewhere in preparation or anticipation or in reaction to some change that\u2019s coming in our marketplace.","Operator","Thank you. For our next question, this comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Craig Hettenbach","Adam, now that you\u2019re more than a year into the FCI acquisition. Can you talk about just maybe any unexpected cause of surprises or how that business is layered in versus initial expectations, and whether it\u2019d be synergies on the OpEx front, revenue, et cetera?","Adam Norwitt","I think we\u2019ve just been pleasantly, surprised is maybe the wrong word, but let's just say we\u2019ve been very satisfied and very pleased with the performance of FCI on a very, very broad basis. And I could keep you all in the phone here for a quite a well talking about the various aspects of why that is. But just starting from the top to financial performance has been outstanding. We talked at the end of last year at our last earnings call how ultimately we were able to realize an accretion of $0.19 a share and we came into the year thinking it was going to be $0.12. So that alone, from a financial performance, was outstanding.","They increased the margins, and I say they meaning the FCI team, who really has done the work here. They increased the margins of the business quite significantly, bringing them really into the level of where Amphenol operations like to perform. We saw just a great embrace of the Amphenol culture by the people and just so proud to have all the people from FCI who just on day one they flipped the switch and they said we want to be part of this Amphenol. And that has worked out extremely well for us and for them in addition.","I think the response of customers and ultimately the presence that we\u2019ve gained with customers and has probably surpassed my early expectations. You frequently come into an acquisition like this with some dreams and aspirations in terms of well we can expand our presence with customers and this or that area, and that will take some time and it usually doesn\u2019t happen overnight. I think here our commitment to the markets where FCI participates; markets like the IT datacom markets; markets like the embedded computing market in industrial; markets like the mobile networks market. Us making that very significant commitment to being a leader, a broad leader, for customers in those markets has been received very well and rewarded very well.","And we had the question earlier with respect to the organic growth in the IT datacom market that I\u2019m asked earlier in the call and I would tell that I think a part of our organic strength has in fact been related to the presence of FCI and the broad reception that we\u2019ve gotten from customers in there. And I think the last thing I would point to is as the distribution channel. We talked about that early on when we made the acquisition of FCI and the response from our distributors has just been outstanding. And I think that we now sit in a stronger position viz-a-viz our distributors and we did prior to acquiring FCI.","And I gave the FCI team again a lot of credit for knowing how to work with distributors, maybe even a little bit of a different way than we had in the past and that has really helped our Company overall. So I added all up and we\u2019re just very pleased with the acquisition, and I don\u2019t even refer to it any longer as an acquisition as far as I am concerned, FCI it feels like they\u2019ve been part of our Company for decades.","Operator","Thank you. For our question, this comes from the line of Joe Giordano from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Tristan Margot","This is Tristan in for Joe, thanks for squeezing me in here. Adam, I think you mentioned the opportunity for new mobile networks going forward in your prepared remarks. I was wondering if you exposed to the upcoming first responded network that was awarded a few weeks ago. And if that\u2019s the case then could you try to frame the opportunity for us in terms of magnitude and timing?","Adam Norwitt","I think we have exposure to a lot of different networks, and I think that would include the one that you mentioned here, which I think is referred to as FirstNet and in the marketplace. What the magnitude of that is going to be, what the magnitude of that for us is going to be, I think it's too early to tell. But we\u2019re always encouraged whenever we see a new overlay network thing that has traditionally been a very good thing for us. I think our team really jumps on those opportunities well in advance even if their announcement to make sure that we\u2019re present with customers really around the world who are doing these things with their networks.","And with something like FirstNet again I think it's still a little early to tell what that ultimately was going to work out to be. But you can imagine whenever you have a new overlay networks like that, there is not just a network thing built but there is devices, there is sub-systems, there is a whole eco system that gets built around something like that. And I think ultimately when you have new electronic ecosystems being built out, that\u2019s a good thing for our Company.","Tristan Margot","And then you could just add quick one on datacom and congrats on your strong result there. I was wondering if you could breakdown your expectation by region and if you are seeing any inventory build in any of the regions? Thank you.","Adam Norwitt","I think on region, I don\u2019t think there is anything really interesting to report on the regional aspects over datacom business. It's very hard to say because a lot of datacom equipment is all built in Asia. And so we don\u2019t ultimately know where that equipment ends up. And so a regional review of this is actually not the most interesting or germane to talk about in the business. In terms of inventory and IT datacom, we haven\u2019t seen any significant signs of inventory builds, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen across all of our markets any abnormalities, let me say with inventory across datacom or really any of our markets.","Operator","Thank you. For our last question, this comes from the line of Brian White with Drexel. Your line is open. Mr. White, your line is open for your question.","Adam Norwitt","Well, it appears that maybe Brian is not with us here. I think that is the last question and we very much appreciate everybody's time here and your attention in Amphenol. And we look forward to speaking with you all here in another 90 days or so. Thanks very much and best wishes to you all for a successful spring. Thank you. Bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you for attending today\u2019s conference. Have a nice day."],"2242":["Amphenol Corp.

Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo and Mr. Adam Norwitt. You may begin.","Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.","Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO. And I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We'd like to welcome you to our second quarter 2017 conference call.","Our second quarter 2017 results were released this morning, I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter and then Adam will give an overview of the business, as well as current trends, then we'll take questions.","As a reminder, we may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information.","The company closed the second quarter with record sales GAAP diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.667 billion, $0.80 and $0.81 respectively, exceeding the high end of the company's guidance for sales by $47 million, GAAP EPS by $0.08 and adjusted EPS by $0.09. Sales were up 8% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currencies compared to the second quarter of last year. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the second quarter increased a strong 6%. Sequentially, sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars and 6% in local currency and organically.","Bringing down sales into our two segments, our Cable business, which comprise 6% of our sales, was up 16% from the second quarter of last year, primarily due to the impact of acquisitions as well as organic growth.","The Interconnect business, which comprised 94% of our sales, was up 7% in U.S. dollars from last year, driven primarily by organic growth as well as the impact of acquisitions.","Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. GAAP operating income and adjusted operating income were $336 million and $340 million respectively for the second quarter. GAAP operating margin was 20.2% in the quarter and GAAP operating income includes approximately $4 million or $0.01 per share of acquisition-related transaction cost.","Adjusted operating margin was 20.4% in the quarter, which is up a strong 100 basis points compared to 19.4% on a GAAP and adjusted basis in 2016 and was up 30 basis points from the first quarter of this year.","From a segment standpoint, in the Cable segment, margins were 14.9%, which is unchanged compared to the second quarter of last year. In the Interconnect segment, margins increased to 22.3% in the second quarter, compared to last year at 21.2%, reflecting the progress made at FCI as well as strong overall operational performance.","This excellent performance is the direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster high performance, action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment.","Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies to both existing and acquired companies, our management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance in the future.","Interest expense for the quarter was $23 million compared to $18 million last year, reflecting the impact of higher average interest rates resulting from the senior notes issuance earlier in the quarter as well as the higher average debt levels, primarily resulting from the company's stock buyback program.","The company's GAAP and adjusted effective tax rates were approximately 20% for the second quarter of 2017 compared to our guidance for the quarter of approximately 26% and an effective tax of 26.5% in second quarter of last year.","As a result of the 2017 adoption of the new stock-based compensation standard that we discussed last quarter, option exercise activity had the effect of lowering the company's second quarter tax provision by approximately $21 million and increasing the diluted EPS by approximately $0.07.","I would also note that our guidance reflects an expected effective tax rate for the third quarter of approximately 25% and for the full year of approximately 23% to 24%. Net income is a strong 15% of sales in the quarter. GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS with $0.80 and $0.81 respectively in the quarter compared to $0.65 in the second quarter of last year.","Adjusted diluted EPS grew 25% in the quarter compared to the second quarter of last year. This strong growth was supported by strong operating performance as demonstrated by the company's adjusted operating margin of 20.4% along with the lower effective tax rate just mentioned.","Orders for the quarter were $1.712 billion, an 8% increase over the second quarter of last year resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.03:1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash and cash flow from operations with $280 million in the quarter or approximately 111% of net income.","The company continues to target and achieve cash flow from operations in excess of net income.","From a working capital standpoint, inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were $1.1 billion, $1.4 billion and $770 million respectively at the end of the quarter. And inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 84 days, 74 days and 61 days respectively, excluding the impact of acquisitions recently closed, which were all within our normal range.","The cash flow from operations of $280 million, along with the $750 million of bond proceeds from the new senior notes previously mentioned, and stock option proceeds of $49 million were used primarily to fund net payments under the commercial paper program of $589 million. To fund acquisitions and purchases of minority interest of $168 million, to purchase approximately $151 million of the company's stock, to fund net capital expenditures of $51 million and to fund dividend payments of $49 million, which resulted in an increase of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $80 million net of translation. Note that this does not include the amount paid for Telect here in July.","During the quarter, the company repurchased 2 million shares at an average price of approximately $75. These repurchases were completed under the company's $1 billion, two year stock repurchase program that was approved in January. To date, the company has repurchased approximately 5.7 million shares or $400 million under the plan. In addition, as mentioned in the earnings release, the company's board of directors has approved a 19% increase in the quarterly dividend on the company's common stock from $0.16 to $0.19 per share, bringing the dividend yield back to approximately 1%. This increase is effective for payments beginning in October.","At June 30, cash and short-term investments were approximately $1.4 billion, the majority of which is held outside of the U.S. Also at the end of the quarter, the company has issued $655 million under its commercial paper program, and the company's cash and availability under our credit facilities totaled approximately $2.7 billion. Total debt at June 30 was approximately $3.4 billion and net debt is approximately $2 billion. In the second quarter of 2017, EBITDA was approximately $403 million.","From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter. Adam will now provide an overview of the business and comment on current trends.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Well, thank you very much, Craig. And I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome all of you to our quarterly call here with respect to our second quarter earnings. I will spend a few moments just to highlight some of the achievements in the second quarter that Craig just detailed. I'll then discuss the trends and our progress across our various served markets and then spend a few moments at the end to comment on our outlook for the third quarter and the full year of 2017. And of course, we'll have time for questions at the end.","In the second quarter, we delivered results above the high end of guidance, as we establish new records in orders, sales, and earnings per share, all while continuing to expand our industry-leading operating margins. As Craig mentioned, revenues increased by 8% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically, reaching that new record of $1.670 billion.","We're very pleased that our order bookings were strong with a book-to-bill of 1.03:1, reaching $1.700 billion in orders. And in particular, I think our whole team is proud that our margins continue to increase by a strong 100 basis points over prior year to 20.4% and that's just a really excellent achievement by the whole organization.","EPS reached a new record of $0.81, increasing 25% from prior year, and we generated cash as well with cash flow reaching a very robust $280 million.","The last thing I'll say is that I'm very pleased that just yesterday our board of directors approved a 19% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.19 per quarter, yet another sign and confirmation of the strength of Amphenol's financial condition. So I'll just say that I'm very proud of our team. The Amphenol organization's discipline and agility is clearly reflected in the company's excellent second quarter results.","On the second quarter, our small headquarters acquisition team was extremely busy throughout the last quarter and in particular during the last week or two of the quarter and beginning of this quarter. We closed on three important and exciting acquisitions that actually involved five distinct businesses, collectively with revenues, annual revenues of approximately $165 million.","First in late June, we acquired three sensor businesses from the UK-based defense company Meggitt PLC. These three outstanding and entrepreneurial operations are based in Spain, as well as Maryland and Indiana, focused on vibration, position and ultrasonic sensing solutions that are used in the industrial, automotive and military markets. And collectively those three organizations have sales totaling approximately $75 million. These companies, which operate as PIHER, Wilcoxon and Piezo Technologies or Piezotech, represent an excellent complement to our expanding offering of sensor technologies.","Second, and also in late June, we acquired Intelligente Sensorsysteme or i2S, a Dresden, Germany-based manufacturer of pressure, temperature and mass airflow sensors for the automotive and industrial markets, with annual sales of approximately $45 million. i2S is an extremely high technology sensor supplier with a particular strength in harsh environment pressure sensors that are used in a variety of applications.","With these new sensor acquisitions, I can just say that we're very pleased that we've now made another great step forward in expanding and diversifying our sensor offering, and that's the road that we've been on for now, the better part of 3.5 years. And we continue to look forward to finding both organic and inorganic ways to expand the company's position in the sensor market.","Finally, in early July, just a few weeks ago, we completed the acquisition of Telect Incorporated. Telect is a Washington state-based manufacturer of power, fiber, and copper interconnect systems for data centers with annual sales of approximately $45 million. In addition to its Washington State facility, Telect also operates a manufacturing operation in Mexico.","We're really pleased Telect, which is a family company that was founded 35 years ago \u2013 it has a strong track record of supplying high technology, value-add products with unique service solution for enterprise and service provider data centers. And the addition of this great business bolsters our already very strong offering of products that support expanding data center applications.","Just want to say that once again I'm extremely proud of our acquisition team as they've brought on these excellent new additions to the Amphenol family, which gives us just great confidence that our acquisition program will continue to create significant value for the company going into the future.","Now, with respect to our trends and progress across our served markets, we remain just very pleased with the breadth and balance of the company's end markets. We believe that that balance in particular is a great asset for Amphenol, especially given the ongoing dynamics within the global electronics market.","Turning first to the military market; the military market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased from prior year by a greater-than-expected 17% in U.S. dollars and 18% organically, as we recovered from last year's DLA-stopped shipment and again realized growth across virtually every segment of the military market. Our growth in the quarter was strongest in space, ordnance-related, naval, military vehicle and communications applications, but it was truly a very broad based growth in the military market. And I would say, it was broad based also geographically. We are very pleased to see great growth in Europe as well as in North America and other geographies. Sequentially, our sales in the military market were up by 4%, which was a bit more than we had expected coming into the quarter.","And looking into the third quarter, we expect sales in the military market to be slightly lower on the traditional summer seasonality. Nonetheless, for the full-year 2017, we now expect sales to grow in the high single-digits on a year-over-year basis. We are very encouraged by the company's strengthened outlook in the military market. As the interconnect leader in the military market, our team has positioned us to benefit from expanded spending by militaries around the world on a wide array of new electronic systems. And we look forward to continuing to build on this position of strength into the future.","The commercial aerospace market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and sales were flat to prior year as overall demand for commercial aircraft remained stable, while customers were managing their procurement volumes following the recent ramp ups of new programs that happened over the prior year or two. Sequentially, in the second quarter, our sales were down slightly from the first quarter, which was a little bit softer than we had expected coming into the quarter.","Looking into the third quarter, we expect volumes in the commercial air market to increase from these levels as customer demand normalizes. And for the full year of 2017, we continue to expect a mid-single digit increase from prior year, supported by the acquisition of Phitek completed earlier this year. Despite our results in the second quarter being a bit lower than we had expected, we remain very encouraged by Amphenol's strong overall position in the commercial aircraft market. Our high technology product offering together with our strategic relationships with airplane manufacturers around the world, positions us to benefit long-term from expanded volumes of aircraft in support of the continued global growth of air traffic.","The industrial market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew by a very robust 19% in U.S. dollars, 21% in local currency and 14% organically, very strong performance, as we benefited from organic growth in instrumentation, factory automation and heavy equipment, together with the contributions from our acquisitions completed over the last year. Would note that we were very pleased in the quarter to see a return to growth of our sales into the oil and gas market, albeit from currently lower levels. Sequentially, our sales grew in the industrial market by a stronger-than-expected 15% from the first quarter.","Looking into the third quarter, we expect the normal seasonal moderation of sales. For the full year 2017, however, we now expect a mid-teen sales increase on a year-over-year basis, as we benefit from strengthening organic growth together with the contributions from several of our new sensor acquisitions. We are very encouraged by the strengthened outlook in the industry market and I would just reiterate that our ongoing efforts towards broadening our offering of interconnect, sensor and antenna products has positioned us strongly across the many segments of the global industrial market and we look forward to realizing the long-term benefits from this approach into the future.","The automotive market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter and automotive was again a very strong contributor in the second quarter. Sales increased by a higher-than-expected 13% in U.S. dollars, 15% in local currencies 13% organically with strong growth actually in all regions. Sequentially, our automotive sales increased by 6% from the first quarter.","Looking into the third quarter, we expect our sales to increase from these levels, driven primarily by the additions of Piher and i2S in what is normally seasonally softer quarter. And for the full year, we now expect sales growth in the low teens, with the contributions from these acquisitions together with an incrementally stronger outlook for our organic growth in the automotive market.","We remain excited by the company's excellent position in the automotive market. Our continually expanding range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products, positions us to take advantage of the multitude of opportunities to enable new electronics in cars. Whether that'd be in traditional fuel power, hybrid or electric vehicles, we see car makers around the world integrating advanced electronics into virtually every function in the automobile. This creates an outstanding long-term growth opportunity for the company.","The mobile devices market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter and our sales in mobile devices fell by a bit more than expected 20% compared to prior year as modest increases in sales of products incorporated into laptops were more than offset by softer sales related to tablets and smartphones. Sequentially our sales did increase by 13% from the first quarter.","Now looking into the third quarter, we expect a quite significant increase in sales nearly 40% sequentially from second quarter levels as we participate in several new product ramp ups.","For the full-year, however, on the basis of the latest outlooks from our customers, we do now expect sales to decline in the mid-to-high single digits on a year-over-year basis. Regardless of this more muted demand outlook for 2017, I remain extremely confident that our experienced and agile team who works in the mobile devices market has positioned us to benefit from any opportunities that may arise in this dynamic market.","The mobile networks market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. Our sales were down from prior year by about 3%, as increased sales to equipment manufacturers were more than offset by reductions in demand from mobile network operators, and that was driven by pauses in their investments in new wireless systems. Sequentially, sales were flat for the first quarter. I'd say that going into the third quarter, we now expect sales to improve modestly from these levels, but nevertheless we've yet to see our wireless operator customers meaningfully improve their spending outlooks for the remainder of this year; accordingly, we continue to expect the low-to-mid single digit decline in the sales for the full-year 2017 consistent with what we talked about last quarter.","Despite this year's pause in demand, I would just tell you that Amphenol's position in the mobile networks market remains very strong. We continue to work with equipment manufacturers and operators around the world to enable their next generation networks with our broad array of interconnect and antenna products. In particular, we're working with a wide array of customers as they prepare for the coming adoption of 5G, as well as other next generation networks, and that creates an encouraging long-term potential for the company.","The IT and data communications market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter, and I'm very pleased that our team working in the IT market drove another excellent quarter, as sales increased by a greater-than-expected 15% in U.S. dollars and 12% organically. Sequentially, our sales increased by about 3% from the first quarter. Our sales were strongest in networking-related applications, but we did also realize growth in both service and storage. And in addition, our team continued to accelerate momentum with cloud service providers, really this next \u2013 new generation of IT hardware consumers and we remain very pleased with our progress with these new customers, who continue to invest in next generation systems, to enable the explosive growth of cloud computing. Now with the addition of Telect, we have again broadened our position in the data center, an exciting area of growth potential for Amphenol.","Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to moderate slightly from these levels and for the full-year 2017, we continue to expect sales in the mid-to-high single digits in the IT datacom market. I remain very proud of our team working in this market and they have done just a fabulous job of successfully expanding our industry leading range of high speed and power products, while ensuring that we support the broadest range of customers around the world.","And finally, the broadband communication market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter, sales in this market increased from prior year by 10%, driven by the benefits from the All Systems Broadband acquisition that we made at the end of last year. Organically, our sales were slightly down as cable operators moderated their overall capital spending. Sequentially, sales increased by a strong 10% from prior quarter, which was encouraging here in the second quarter. For the third quarter, we expect our sales to remain at these levels and for the full year, we do continue to expect low double-digit growth, driven in particular by the impact of acquisitions completed over the recent year. It's important to understand that the broadband industry continues to experience consolidation among the operators that work in that industry and that consolidation can certainly cause pauses in the capital investment cycles of our customers. Nevertheless, with our continually broadening product offering, we look forward to take advantage of any opportunities to expand our market position with cable operators around the world in 2017 and beyond.","So, just in summary, with respect to the second quarter, I just reaffirm that I'm just extremely pleased with the company's excellent results during the quarter. We delivered strong organic performance, executed on three acquisitions of five distinct businesses, increased our dividend by 19% and continued to return substantial capital to shareholders through our stock buyback program.","And while the global market environment remains uncertain, the Amphenol organization is executing extraordinarily well in expanding our market position, while strengthening the company's financial performance. And that performance is a direct reflection of Amphenol's distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across our diversified markets, worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure, a highly effective acquisition program and most importantly, an agile entrepreneurial management team.","So turning to the outlook for the third quarter and the full year, and based on the continuation of the current uncertain economic environment and also assuming constant exchange rates. We now expect the following results. For the third quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1.700 billion to $1.740 billion and earnings per share in the range of $0.77 to $0.79. This represents the sales and adjusted diluted EPS increase versus prior year of 4% to 6%, and 5% to 8% respectively.","For the full-year 2017, we expect sales in the range of $6.620 billion to $6.700 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.06 to $3.10. And again for the full year, this represents a sales and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 5% to 7% and 13% to 14% respectively over 2016 levels. On an organic basis, our full-year guidance now represents an outlook of full year sales growth of 2% to 4%.","We're very encouraged by the company's robust performance in the first half of 2017 and here in the second quarter, as well as our strength and outlook for the remainder of the year, and I'm confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon these results by continuing to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position and deliver strong financial performance in 2017 and beyond.","And with that, operator, it would be our pleasure to take any questions if there may be.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The question-and-answer period will now being. Our first question come from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. I have a question and a follow-up for you guys. I guess to start off with on the automotive segment. I guess, Adam, there has been a lot of concerns around cycle and the slowdown in that marketplace. I think you guys actually took up your full year forecast from high single-digit last quarter to low-teens. Could you just help me understand how much of that uptick was organic versus M&A? And just broadly what are you seeing in the automotive market.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah. Well, thank you very much Amit. I think we had a very strong quarter in the automotive market and we're really pleased with the progress that we've made there. And I mentioned actually in my prepared remarks that one thing that we're pleased in particular is to see strong performance, really organically in all regions around the world. And I think it's a testament to just the continued proliferation of electronics and our ability to capture, maybe a little bit more than our fair share of some of those electronic applications.","With respect to our guidance, I would tell you that there was a component of strength organically as well as the contributions from the acquisitions and I think \u2013 let's call it roughly balanced between the two of them in terms of the increase in our guidance.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Perfect. And if I could just follow-up on mobile devices, based on what you guys are seeing for 2017, it would mark, I think the second year in a row now that revenues are going to decline in that segment. I'm curious, how do you see this segment structurally as you go forward, is it something that's going to decline I guess manage and maximize free cash flow or is this something unique that you think has driven declines of fairly healthy magnitudes for two years in a row now?","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah. Look, I mean, we're not happy to now have that outlook that it will be down two years in a row, but at the same time, we don't put the baby out with the bathwater. I mean, we have had a fabulous position, we continue to have a fabulous position in the mobile devices market and that is not a market where we just say, well, we're going to just maximize the cash flow.","We continue to approach that market the same way that we have always done, which is to make sure that we're creating high technology enabling products for our customers across a variety of applications and encompass mobile devices and we will continue to do so without any hesitation. The reality is, is it's a very dynamic market, we have said that in the past, I think there's no question, we were down last year, the year before it was one of our fastest growing market and this year it appears that it will be down again. I mean without getting ahead of my skies on talking about what it maybe in the future, it's hard to do that when we are not even able to do so, so effectively within this 12-month period. I can tell you that we don't back away from that market, we don't consider to exit it, we don't consider to just milk it for cash, we continue to support our customers in that market with a wide array of interconnect, antenna, mechanical products with the full knowledge that always, you will see new things in the market where ultimately the premium put on the hardware will allow us to realize great performance in a market despite whatever near-term challenges that there may be, so we're very committed to the market on it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Good afternoon and thanks very much for taking the question. The first question is a follow-up on mobile devices market, not looking for any quantitative view, but are there any technical changes that you're aware that you think could be future opportunities for more content gains, things like 4.5 or 5G and what that may mean for your opportunity in antennas and connectors?","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Sure, I mean there are \u2013 the thing about mobile devices is there are always technical changes all the time. So we see every year new innovations as well as older innovations going away, and some of those are favorable and some of those are not favorable for us and it's our job to make sure that we're in the forefront with our customers giving them new solutions to help them enable that.","As it relates to 5G, there is no doubt about it that 5G has a total new architecture potentially, because it's not yet finalized, but potentially in terms of how signals are transmitted from the infrastructure to the devices. And I can just tell you that we're really working in the forefront of those efforts with customers on both sides, whether that be in the mobile networks market or in the mobile devices market, to ensure that we're presenting them solutions that can really deal with those very, very challenging aspects of what that would be ultimately at 5G. And I think the fact that we have that very broad, in particular, RF expertise, radio frequency, whether that be on interconnect or antennas. It's something that is looked upon very favorably by our customers across really both of those markets. And I know you asked about mobile devices, but you really can't talk about 5G without talking about the holistic system between the networks and the devices. And we're very \u2013 I think we're in a very good position, given that we have a strong position across both of those divides, if you will.","So what the technical changes ultimately will be, that I have a hard time to tell you, because I can tell you a lot of those decisions have not yet been made by customers. But our team is there at the table with customers on both sides, working to ensure that we're well represented.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. And a follow-up question on the three deals that you announced this quarter, can you help us understand where the profitability levels are for margins and how much to full-year EPS the three deals are contributing?","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah. I think these companies all operate \u2013 I think it is the case, all of them operate below the company average. And you can think about them in terms of sort of low-teens EBITDA, highish single-digit operating margin. and I don't know that we're splitting out exactly what the accretion is, but it's only half a year right now. So wouldn't expect \u2013 it's not significant accretion, I don't know, Craig.","Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.","No, it isn't significant. A I think \u2013 as I would think about this is, as we've done with all our acquisitions at these lower profitability levels we certainly are committed to work over time to improve the profitability of these businesses. These are great businesses, it's great technologies and certainly great management teams. And we feel very comfortable that over a period of time that we'll be able to get them up to the profitability levels that we would expect and then drive even additional accretion from that.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Absolutely.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thank you. It seems like you had some comments in the press release and on the conference call that the demand environment is sort of mixed. And it seems like, if we look at the more traditional industrial segments and GDP exposed segments, those are \u2013 appear to be improving and were a bit stronger for you, but the traditional IT segments continue to see some challenges and obviously transitions to different types of business models like the cloud model. Is that a fair assessment of the business, and is that sort of what you're seeing as we move into the back half of the year?","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah. I mean, I haven't thought about it that way, but I guess it's not an unreasonable assessment, because if you look at the markets where we really outperformed in the quarter, it was indeed military, industrial, automotive, in particular. I guess, IT datacom, we had very strong performance though. So I don't know that it's a completely true statement to say that it's the more traditional GDP-led industries as opposed to the technology industries, because I think we're really outperforming in IT datacom through capitalizing on that shift to the cloud. But no doubt about it, military, industrial, automotive all very, very strong organic growth.","But what I would also reiterate is, this is not just a rising tide. I mean, if you look at our growth in military, yes, there was some component of that, that came from a recovery from the DLA, but our growth even without that was very, very strong in the quarter. And I don't think you have seen for example, military budgets growing high single-digits on a global basis. And similarly with industrial, we grew 14% in the quarter, a very, very strong performance organically, 19% in U.S. dollars.","And again, I don't know that GDP is necessarily growing at those rates. Our team has just done a fabulous job in the industrial market, positioning us in areas that we have not necessarily been as present before. And one of the ways we have done that is by capitalizing on many of the acquisitions that we've done. At the time we acquired FCI, FCI was not known actually as \"an industrial company\" but we were very excited at the time that we acquired with FCI a tremendous range of industrial products, in particular related to embedded computing.","And so when we see growth in places like instrumentation, factory automation, in particular, which were two of the fastest-growing segments within the industrial market for us, there is some portion of that which is actually organic growth of some of those FCI products that we would not have had in the past. And I think that's really a great benefit that we start to see from having that broader range of products in industrial. And I think I had talked already about automotive and you have an automotive market which is maybe in units, flat or some even say slightly down on a year-over-year basis and we grew in that market organically by 13%, so I don't know that that's again just a GDP trend.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's super helpful, Adam, thanks for that detail. And then can I just ask, there has been a lot of commentary about component shortages and some component issues. You didn't really talk about it in the call, but can you talk through any issues that you're seeing and if it had any impact on any of your end markets or any of your ability to deliver products? Thank you.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Thank you very much. We hear some rumblings about this. I hear more of it related to the distribution channel and extending lead times for things like passive components. I can't tell you that we have seen anything material related to shortages that would affect our ability to service our customers, I think even when there is just a slight a sniff of that, I can tell you that our team jumps into action to make sure that we're supporting customers in whatever they want to \u2013 whatever they need. And nor have we heard anything material about our customers reducing their procurement of our product because of other shortages. That I have not seen in any real meaningful way over the course of the last quarter. But I certainly hear in the distribution channel in particular that there is some extending lead times on things that are unrelated necessarily to the interconnect world.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research. Your line's open.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Hi, afternoon everybody.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Hi, Shawn.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. Two questions. Going back to mobile devices. Is the dynamic this year being down a function of you walking away from business where the pricing was uncompetitive and competitors decided to undercut it you this year, was there something in the design change year-over-year with the smartphones or maybe you missed that. It sounds like a little bit of both, but I wonder if you could provide any clarity on that? And then I have a follow-up.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Sure. I mean, I'd say, I would love to tell you that there is a silver bullet here, but there is not, you know it's a very dynamic market. So all the things that you mentioned can happen to you or you can \u2013 there can be also just overall shifts in volumes and dynamics and \u2013 or you don't win everything, as it comes along. What I can tell you is, there is some combination of all of the above that would represent that. I think we've talked about one in particular dynamic, which is that the tablet market continues to be a significant drag on the overall volumes and in the market. In particular, because tablets do have much more significant content and content potential than you would have in just a traditional smartphone. And I think the overall global units of tablets continue to fall. And so, I think, that's more in the category of just the overall market being down and then you have design changes, you have differences of technology, you have pricing pressure, you have all of the above. So I'm not trying to cop out here Shawn, but I would just tell you that there is not just a one driver of that new expectation that we have for the year.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. That's fair. And then on the mobile networks business, Adam, I think you made the comment that the operators haven't stepped up their spending yet was \u2013 did you have an expectation be it in any region of the world where you would see an acceleration into the back half of the year and that's falling short or is it just more of \u2013 they haven't spent and they're not going to spend?","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah, I think, it's more of the latter. I mean, we haven't changed our outlook for this market. I think we continue to have an outlook, which is similar to what I talked about last quarter. So it's not that we had anticipated something to come. Now, I'm an optimistic guy. So I always love to hope that maybe we will be proven wrong on our outlook and that it will be a little bit better than we had expected and I don't think that seems to be in the cards here.","This is a market where as you know very well, I mean you follow that market so closely, that goes in waves. And those waves get impacted by a couple of dynamics. One of those dynamics is the generational shift in the product and I think we are this year a little bit in that interstitial period between generations.","The second is that you get the sort of corporate uncertainty that can strike the market either someone wants to be sold, someone wants to be bought, companies come together, companies don't come together and inevitably when that happens, especially with service providers and we see that here and in the broadband market, they tend not to overspend, let's say on capital at a time when their corporate future is not fully gelled and understood internally or externally. And I think that those two dynamics seem this year to both be the case, but looking into the coming years, I would just tell you that everything that we hear from our customers is there is a lot of potential with next generation networks. The traffic that is coursing through these networks continues to increase on an exponential basis. The requirements around coverage, around latency, around power consumption, all the things that are so critical to the strong functioning of a network, those do not abate in their importance in the eyes of both our operator and our OEM customers. And thus there continues to be tremendous ongoing work to develop, enabling solutions for next generation. Our team is very much engaged in that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. Adam, your first half 2017 organic growth that you reported is higher than your full-year guidance of 2% to 4%. So for second half, can you talk about where that deceleration is coming from or were there any pull-forward issues, especially given that the comps actually get a lot easier in 3Q on organic basis, and I have a follow-up?","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah. I mean, I don't \u2013 I think, I've given already our outlook for all of the markets here in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And I don't know that it would be still helpful for me to go one by one. But I would say on a year-over-year basis, probably the biggest change between first half and second half is IT datacom market, where we had an outstanding second half of last year. You may recall, we grew in the second half last year in IT datacom in the third quarter by 19% organically and in the fourth quarter by 27% organically. And we certainly don't have that same expectation here in the second half for that market, which is actually today our largest market by a hair here, it's 21% of sales. So I think that's probably the market that has to the calculation that you're looking at, probably the largest impact.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks, Adam. And can you talk a little bit about the geographical footprint for Meggitt and i2S. It seems like they're both like European based and is it pretty \u2013 the sale is pretty concentrated currently in Europe and do you see an opportunity to scale and can you also comment on sort of the i2S sensors if those are primarily high pressure sensors and what applications they're best positioned in? Thanks.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Sure. So, obviously i2S is based in Dresden, so you can assume correctly that they have predominance of European. The three companies that we acquired from Meggitt, one of them is based in Europe and the other two are based here in North America. So I would actually say that they are probably a little bit more North America-centric in its totality than Europe-centric. And i2S indeed has just an outstanding position in a broad array of pressure sensors, maybe a little bit tilting towards higher pressure, but in particular really harsh environment.","So sensors that can operate at extremely high temperature as well as pressure and not have a degradation in the performance and the function in accurately reflecting the pressure even in a very harsh environment and that's what's quite special about i2S and their capabilities in that area. And you can see those applications in automotive and industrial both equally, actually.","Operator","Our next question comes from William Stein of SunTrust. Your line is open.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. More on the recent M&A, these deals seem slightly more slanted towards or maybe a lot more slanted towards sensors than the overall portfolio, and we know this is a sort of multi-year thing, you started three years ago. Should we think about the pipeline of deals continuing to lean more towards sensor products than connectors or antennas?","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","No, I wouldn't necessarily thing about that. I've said in the past, Will, that we can't control the timing of acquisitions. I mean, we do our best and we're very quick and lean and responsive with our small team here, but ultimately it comes down to the decision of a seller to sell and when they're going to do so. And it just so happened in this case that there was this sort of coalesce of companies that came together here roughly at the same time within a couple of weeks of each other. But I think, I did say, three and half years ago, at the time that we made our first significant sensor acquisition, which was the Advanced Sensors Business from GE that we saw that as an outstanding platform for both organic and M&A driven growth for the long-term for Amphenol.","And that it was a market that we felt was very similar to the connector market circa 15 years, 20 years ago. And if you remember, the way that I thought about that and I continue to think about it, the connector market used to be a market where there were a very few large players, there were a lot of small moms and pops and small to mid-sized companies. And then there were a range of companies that were also owned by conglomerates. And over time, the conglomerates came to the realization that owning a component company of that type was not necessarily in their best interest, and they couldn't really maximize the value and performance of those companies. And the moms and pops came to the realization that in order to grow and get really beyond the glass ceiling that strikes those small companies that also made sense to be a part of a larger enterprise.","And I think, what we've seen here is all of those dynamics playing out in what was a relatively short time period. Here you have a wonderful company Meggitt, I mean just an outstanding company that we're very proud to do business with here, who came to the conclusion that this was not the component that fit into their business strategy, and they came to a very rational conclusion about that.","And at the same time, here is a sort of entrepreneurially start-up company that, in the case of i2S,","where the founder is still the General Manager as part of Amphenol, and so it's sort of both ends of that spectrum that I talked about back when we acquired the Advanced Sensors Business of GE. And we would expect that same dynamic to continue to have potential for new acquisitions going into the future. But what I wouldn't assume is that we are really tilting our acquisition focus or our acquisition resources just towards sensors and to the expense of interconnect, we still see fabulous opportunities in the interconnect market organically and through M&A and we will continue to pursue those with the full force, and the full level of energy that we have always done in the past.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I appreciate that. One quick follow-up if I can, we didn't have a specific expectation for the timing of the dividend increase that you delivered today. And you mentioned yield, I think most companies tend to sort of think about this from a capital allocation perspective as a payout ratio, percentage of earnings or cash flow, and that metrics seems to hover around 20% historically. Is that how we should think about capital allocation between dividend buyback and M&A that the dividend should continue to pace around 20% of earnings?","Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah. Thanks Will. That's a great question. As we \u2013 I think I start with that, as we've said in the past, our capital deployment kind of strategy over time is to have about half of our free cash flow as a return of capital to shareholders and as you know, that's kind of a cross between our dividend program and our share repurchase program. We have been and we'll continue to be committed to our dividend program at this 1% yield, we think that's an appropriate yield. And as you point out that has turned out to be roughly 20% or so over our free cash flow.","I think \u2013 we think about it really more in the 50% return of capital and so I would think about it as that 1% of yield and it just turns out mathematically to kind of turn into that 20% of free cash flow with the rest being kind of share repurchases. This year, year-to-date, we've kind of been a little bit above that, just because of, we have renewed our share repurchase program, we've done roughly $400 million of share repurchases, 5.7 million so far this year. Any quarter could be different in regards to that depending on market prices of the stock and different cash needs, but I would say the way to think about it, is really the 50% going to return of capital and consistently staying at roughly that 1% yield for dividends which at this point based on our cash flow is, you're right, around 20%, but that's not necessarily our target per se.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, thanks. Just a question on the sensors, given that the two tuck-ins as well as the sensor business you already have in place, Adam, can you just touch on just kind of maybe the breadth of the portfolio and where you think you're strong at this stage in the sensor market?","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah. No, I would tell you that our portfolio is broader today than it was prior to having completed these acquisitions for sure. I don't mean to be funny about that. We have actually now really an excellent broad portfolio. If you think about sensors from really two dynamics, one is the type of sensor and the second is the markets, in which those sensors are sold.","Today, we have an offering that encompasses pressure, temperature, gas and moisture position now, which is the new type of sensing for us, vibration, which is the new type of sensing for us as well as a range of other mass airflow and areas like that. And in addition, we're selling those sensors now in the automotive market, which we have been from the very beginning, and across a number of segments in the industrial market. Areas like medical and heavy equipment and building automation, what you would maybe even think of as kind of traditional Internet of Things, applications, now having also in the military market, which we're very pleased about, that's an area that we have been very eager to continue to make progress in, given our overall strength in that market.","And we continue to see other opportunities in the sensor market. As we build that breadth of product portfolio on a global basis, we see further opportunities to expand into the markets where we already have great strength through our other product offerings and we'll continue to pursue that relentlessly.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then just as a follow-up, in the industrial space end market, any context between \u2013 it feels like the cyclical environment is a little bit better, but also there's some secular tailwinds, be it factory automation, could you kind of give some color around kind of, what you see as driving a little bit better organic growth in industrial?","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah. I think I spoke a little bit about that to Sherri's question, but I would just reaffirm that we saw great performance in instrumentation and factory automation. And I think those are areas that are consistent with the trend that you mentioned which is, there is a sort of ongoing and even some would say accelerating drive towards automation and creating sort of smart factories and all what's entailed with that.","We were very pleased to see great growth in heavy equipment and I mentioned, albeit from a low base, that we have now started to see growth in the oil and gas market and I don't want to be the one to pick the bottom on that market for sure. But we actually had very strong growth in the oil and gas market from those lower levels in the quarter. We saw continued strong growth in medical, which has been an excellent market for us now for a few years running and I think that medical market is related not just to interconnect, but also to sensors as we described. It's just \u2013 the industrial market, the overall trend that you see \u2013 and it's a long and sort of cumbersome word to say but the electronification of applications that otherwise would have been hydraulic, mechanical or even didn't exist in the past, is something that we see accelerating with customers really across that market. Whether that be in a high speed train or in a hay baler on a farm, you just see more and more electronics being proliferated into heavy industrial applications. And that's something that I think our company is very well positioned to take advantage of.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is open.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Just two questions from me, first-off just to be totally clear, you mentioned how you beat the high end of your guidance range by $47 million. If you dissected that beat, can you just maybe rank what was the biggest contributors to the upside and why? And then, I have a quick follow-up.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah, it was almost \u2013 virtually all organic. I mean...","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","I guess I was trying to understand which markets, Adam?","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Oh, which markets. Yeah, I think if I go back to what I was talking about, military was clearly one, industrial was another, automotive was one, IT datacom. I think those are the four markets which represented the vast majority of that beat.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Great, that's helpful. And then just in terms of acquisitions and maybe the differences between this one and others in the past, given the size of the businesses, the slope of the improvements that you can make, would we expect to see it pretty quickly, like within 12 months? Or how would you expect sort of to get these businesses up to sort of typical Amphenol margins?","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah, I think we don't pin down an exact date. I think what we do when we make an acquisition, the first thing we do is we sit with the management team, and we ask them, what are those areas that you have never been able to approach, what customers, what type of cost reduction opportunities have you not been able to pursue given your size or your position or your ownership or otherwise? And that's really step one. And oftentimes the first step is, hey, I would have loved to go to that customer but they never took my call, or I would have loved to go to that customer but there was a bit of a conflict between that customer and my parent entity, or something like that.","And so those are usually some low-hanging opportunities that we take. And then what we do with the management team is we say, look, we can show you many examples of Amphenol organizations who joined at one point through acquisition, had a certain level of performance, and ultimately achieved a higher level of performance at or above the company average. And we introduce them to some of those people who have gone through the very, very same experience that that management is about to embark upon and they learn a lot from that. I mean, sometimes we'll have them go on a little tour to meet some of those organizations.","And then ultimately, how they make that roadmap to improve comes back to the management that is in place running those individual businesses. And the timeline can be very different depending on the nature of the business, the type of business that they are in, where they're manufacturing, the ease with which things can be changed if necessary, the geography that they are in, those all affect the timing. But what I can say is that our track record here is not a bad one.","If I look at the progress that we made with FCI, if I look at the progress that we've made with others big and small, I mean, ultimately I think we have a very, very good hit rate of bringing those companies over a certain time period to the Amphenol average or above, and that's the mission for all of those companies that have just joined us today. And in fact, as I mentioned earlier, all of these acquisitions, I call them five companies, but it's really three acquisitions. They all join Amphenol with a lower level of operating profitability than we have in the company. So \u2013 and I think all the management teams have embraced that opportunity and that potential.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is open.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks very much. A quick clarification question, then kind of a strategic question. The clarification question is on the Q&A earlier, you had mentioned that on the questions about the mobility about kind of what happened, was it a few missed designs, a little bit more pricing, some less connector content in future phones? And you kind of said, the combination of all the above. Did you really mean all of the above or did you mean like all of the above expect more content per phone, because it seems like there is still more content going in for a mobile phone, that's just kind of the clarification question. Or maybe we've reached a saturation point where there's less connectors going into the phone and I'm just not sure.","And then the strategy question is, the M&A has been very robust for you guys, especially this quarter, which is great. Are you at a point now where you just need to sit back, not sit back or focus your efforts on integrating them or are you still harvesting and hunting more acquisition targets and have more room to guide just even beyond the flurry that came in this quarter. Thank you very much.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Well, thank you very much, Jim. I think what I mentioned on mobility is that there's different content on every different platform. And one area in particular that we've seen in the past where content has declined and we've talked about that in the past is on a place like a tablet, where tablets went from being very multi-networks like 3G capable to being just Wi-Fi and I think that's the dynamic we've talked about over the years, where actually content did not go up in that case. So it's not necessarily true that always content goes up in every iteration of a mobile device. What is true is that every iteration is different and so, sometimes, there is more and sometimes there is less, sometimes there is different, there is different formats of things, but I don't think one can make just a blanket statement that it's either all going up or all going down.","With respect to M&A, it's very true. It was a very active quarter for us and it's been actually a very active year so far for the company, but the way that we're organized is not that we then have to sort of sit back, take our breath and integrate or chew on those companies to digest them, because as you know, very well, we don't do that here at headquarters. We have \u2013 I have eight operating groups around the world and we've got multiple teams who're working with those organizations and in fact, they're doing it. It is the companies that joined Amphenol with their existing management teams all of whom have embraced the opportunity of being part of Amphenol and the potential that comes along with that, they're the once actually doing the \"integrating\" which by the way, is a word that I don't necessarily like to use, because we don't integrate them per se, we're enabling them.","We're giving them opportunities to achieve in areas that they otherwise may not have been able to do as standalone companies and that does not actually take, for example, resources from us here at headquarters with our small acquisition team in order to do that, it takes the ongoing communication between my group executives, with the general managers and their respective teams, who are really doing ultimately the job.","I think if we had an integration organization for example at headquarters, which we don't and that integration organization was too busy, then you could find yourself in that situation that you described, whereby there was just not the bandwidth to keep doing acquisitions. We don't have that issue.","So we have really limitless bandwidth to continue to pursue acquisitions and to execute upon them when the opportunities present themselves. Now does that mean we're going to make further acquisitions here in the third quarter or fourth quarter, the second half? That I cannot tell you, I can tell you that we have a very robust pipeline, but I can't tell you when ultimately those companies are going to sign on the dotted line and agree to be purchased by Amphenol and \u2013 but we'll do our best to make sure that we continue to have those \u2013 do acquisitions. And we have confidence that over the long-term, the acquisition program will continue to be a great wellspring of new talent, new technology and new growth potential for the company.","Operator","Our final question comes from Joseph Giordano of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. I wanted to ask about like the guidance bridge from where you were to where you are today. So in quarters like an $0.08 beat to the high-end and then the tax, the 200 basis points or so in tax that's over a nickel and then you get about $0.11 or so to the EPS range increasing with like a point of organic. So, it's seems like there's an offset somewhere even if we consider the M&A as like \u2013 as a zero for this year, I'm just kind of \u2013 where \u2013 is it on the margin that we have to think about that, it's just \u2013 it seems like I'm missing a piece of it there?","Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.","Sure, Joe. I think the way to think about it from a bottom line perspective is there are few pieces to that, one of them would be the option on exercise impact that I mentioned and honestly that's really just the $0.07 that I did mentioned in my script, that's really the difference from a guidance perspective for the full year. We were not adding any additional assumption for that other than what we had already included in our guidance, which is some small portion in the second half.","In addition to that, certainly we have the acquisition impact. We talked about that being in the single digits from an operating margin perspective. So from an EPS perspective that's really not adding all that much, it is accretive, but it's not adding a significant amount, plus it's only a half of a year. And then after that you have kind of your organic and FX impact, the organic impact really is the majority of that, pretty much, almost all of that really relates to the kind of our beat year in the second quarter. And then there is some incremental related to foreign exchange as well, which added \u2013 we don't necessarily define that, but some small amount as well. But those are the pieces that effectively add up to our guidance from last time to the $2.97 on the high-end to where we're now at $3.10.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co.

Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.","Craig Lampo","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2019 conference call.","Our third quarter results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter. And then, Adam will give you an overview of the business as well as current trends and then we will take questions.","As a reminder, we may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information.","The company closed the third quarter with sales of $2.101 billion and with GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.92 and $0.95 respectively.","Sales were down 1% in US dollars and flat in local currencies compared to the third quarter of 2018. And from an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency impacts, sales in the third quarter decreased 6%. Sequentially, sales were up 4% in US dollars, 5% in local currencies and 3% organically. ","Breaking down sales into our two segments. Our cable business, which comprised 5% of our sales, was down 9% in US dollars and down 8% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of last year.","The interconnect business, which comprised 95% of our sales, was down 1% in US dollars and flat in local currencies compared to last year.","Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.","Adjusted operating income was $414 million for the third quarter of 2019. And adjusted operating margin was 19.7%, which is down 120 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2018. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, adjusted operating margins decreased 60 basis points.","From a segment standpoint, in the cable segment, margins were 10.2%, which was down compared to the 13.1% in the third quarter of 2018, primarily driven by volume as well as, to a lesser extent, product mix.","In the interconnect segment, margins were 21.7% in the third quarter of 2019, which was down compared to 22.7% in the third quarter of last year. This reduction was primarily driven by a relatively normal downside conversion, together with the impact of the cost of the restructuring actions taken in the quarter, as well as the contribution from acquisitions, which are currently operating at a profitability level below the company average.","This quarter's performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high performance, action-oriented culture, in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in an uncertain market environment.","Through the careful fostering of this culture and the deployment of our strategies to both existing and acquired companies, our management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance in the future.","Interest expense for the quarter remained at approximately $30 million and compares to $25 million in the third quarter of last year. As discussed in our prior earnings calls, this increase is due primarily to higher average interest rates as a result of the first quarter bond issuance and higher average debt levels.","The company's adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 24.5% for the third quarter of 2019 compared to 25.5% in the third quarter of 2018. The adjusted effective tax rate excludes the impact of the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises as well as the tax effect of the refinancing-related costs associated with the tender offer in the third quarter of 2019. ","The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019, including the items just mentioned, was approximately 24.5% compared to 23.8% in the third quarter of 2018.","Adjusted net income was a strong 14% of sales in the third quarter of 2019.","On a GAAP basis, our diluted EPS declined by 9% in the third quarter to $0.92 compared to $1.01 in the third quarter 2018. Adjusted diluted EPS declined 4% to $0.95 in the third quarter of 2019 from $0.99 in the third quarter of 2018.","Orders for the quarter were $2.091 billion, which was down 1% compared to the third quarter of 2018 and resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of 1:1.","The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $412 million in the third quarter or approximately 142% of adjusted net income. This was a very strong result.","Net of capital spending of $71 million, our free cash flow was $341 million or 117% of adjusted net income.","From a working capital standpoint, inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were approximately $1.3 billion, $1.7 billion and $831 million respectively at the end of September. And inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 79, 72 and 52 days respectively, all within our normal range. I would note that we are very pleased with the meaningful improvement in net working capital days compared to June.","The cash flow from operations of $412 million, along with proceeds from our recently completed bond offering of $900 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $33 million and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand of approximately $13 million net of translation were used primarily to repay approximately $532 million in borrowings under our commercial paper programs and other facilities, redeem approximately $373 million in senior notes, repurchase approximately $150 million of the company's stock, fund acquisitions of approximately $135 million, fund net capital expenditures of $71 million and fund dividend payments of $68 million.","During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $88 under the $2 billion three-year open stock repurchase plan.","At September 30, cash and short-term investments were approximately $987 million, the majority of which is held outside of the US.","As previously announced on September 4, the company launched a $900 million US bond offering, which has a 10-year term and bears interest at 2.8%. In conjunction with the US senior note issuance on September 11, the company also tendered $147 million of its $375 million 3.125% US senior notes and $205 million of its $500 million 4% US senior notes.","The company used proceeds from the note issuance to fund the tender offer, with the remaining funds being used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion of the borrowings under the US commercial paper program.","This issuance and tender offer further strengthened our capital structure by extending our average debt maturities by approximately two years, while keeping our average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings unchanged.","At September 30, after giving effect to the new bond offering, the company had issued approximately $754 million under its US and Euro commercial paper programs. The company's cash and availability under our credit facilities totaled approximately $2.7 billion.","Total debt at September 30 was approximately $3.9 billion and net debt was approximately $3 billion. The third quarter 2019 adjusted EBITDA was approximately $501 million.","In summary, this was a very strong quarter for the company financially, especially in light of moderating demand and continued uncertainty across global markets.","I will now turn it over to Adam who will provide an overview of the business and comment on current trends.","Adam Norwitt","Well, Craig, thank you very much, and I'd like to extend my welcome to all of you here on the phone today. Thanks so much for spending a few of your precious minutes with us today.","As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the third quarter. I'll then discuss the trends and progress across our served markets. Finally, I'll comment on our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full-year 2019 and, of course, we'll have some time for questions at the end.","Our results in the third quarter exceeded the high end of the company's guidance in both sales and earnings per share, and that was despite continued elevated levels of uncertainty in the marketplace.","Sales declined by 1% in US dollars and were flat in local currencies, reaching just over $2.1 billion. Sales in the quarter were down by 6% organically.","Company booked just under $2.1 billion in orders, representing a book-to-bill of also just under 1:1.","Adjusted diluted EPS in the quarter reached $0.95, which while down 4% from prior year was $0.07 above the high end of our guidance that we gave at the end of last quarter. ","Operating margins in the quarter were 19.7% and did come in a bit stronger than we had anticipated coming into the quarter.","Craig mentioned that the company generated very strong operating and free cash flow of $412 million and $341 million, respectively, in the quarter. I just want to emphasize that this is a great reflection of the quality of the company's earnings.","I'm extremely proud of the Amphenol team around the world. In what's clearly a challenging market environment, we performed very well this quarter. And these excellent results are another clear reflection of the agility and discipline of our entrepreneurial organization around the world.","We're very pleased to have completed two additional acquisitions just here at the end of the quarter, which together represent approximately $60 million in annual sales and which we acquired for a collective purchase price of approximately $87 million.","First, Cablescan. It's a manufacturer of high technology cable assemblies for the military aerospace market. Based in Yorkshire in the UK, Cablescan's products are sold into a range of military aerospace applications, including in particular land vehicles and aviation. And this company represents an outstanding complement to our already broad array of value-add interconnect solutions for the important military and commercial aerospace markets.","XGiga is a manufacturer of active fiber optic interconnect products for the global communications markets. And this company, which is based in Shenzhen, China, broadens our product offering and strengthens our already industry-leading offering of high-speed interconnect products for the communications infrastructure market.","So, as we welcome these outstanding new teams to the Amphenol family, we remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company.","We have now acquired nine great businesses so far here in 2019 and these excellent companies collectively represent annualized revenues of approximately $530 million and, more importantly, they have strengthened Amphenol across nearly all of our end markets with their entrepreneurial management teams, their high technology product offerings and their complementary market positions.","Most importantly, though, these new family members create additional platforms for future expansion and performance improvement in the company. We're pleased that our acquisition program remains a core competitive advantage for Amphenol.","Now, turning to our progress across our served markets, I would just comment that we continue to be very encouraged by the value created by the company's balanced and broad end market diversification.","Once again, in the third quarter, no market represented more than 20% of our sales. And very importantly, this diversification helps to mitigate the impact of the volatility of individual end markets, while all the while exposing us to leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry.","So, turning first to the military market. The military market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by a better-than-expected and very strong 26% in both US dollars and organically.","This strong growth was very broad based, but was driven in particular by growth in military vehicles, naval applications, aviation and communications equipment. Sequentially, our sales increased by a very strong 9% in what is normally a seasonally more moderate quarter.","Looking ahead, we expect sales in the fourth quarter to again increase modestly from these third quarter levels. And for the full-year 2019, we now expect to achieve sales growth in the military market of just above 20%. This improved outlook reflects our team's excellent execution in the face of higher demand from customers across the defense market.","I remain extremely proud of Amphenol's team working in the military market. With strong demand that's being driven by both robust defense spending, together with accelerating adoption of new technologies, our organization has simply done an outstanding job reacting to satisfy that demand, while also expanding our overall market position.","The addition of Cablescan this quarter further strengthens our already strong value-add interconnect offering for a wide array of harsh environment applications.","And our broadened range of interconnect products, together with the strongest and most international manufacturing footprint, positions us very strongly for the future.","The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in commercial air were also stronger than expected, growing 15% in US dollars and 16% organically as we capitalized on continued strong demand for next generation jetliners with high electronics content. Sequentially, our sales were up slightly from the second quarter.","Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these levels. And for the full-year 2019, we continue to expect a low double-digit increase in sales from prior year.","The commercial air market continues to represent a significant opportunity for the future in Amphenol. Our customers are implementing new technologies on existing and next generation jetliner platforms, which creates increased demand for our high technology products. We look forward to benefiting from that favorable trend for many years to come.","The industrial market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the third quarter increased by a less-than-expected 4% in US dollars and were down by 6% organically as growth in oil and gas and medical applications was more than offset by reductions in heavy equipment, instrumentation and battery-related products.","On a sequential basis, our sales did increase by 2% from the second quarter as the contributions from the CONEC and Bernd Richter acquisitions that we announced last quarter were offset in part by slowing demand in the industrial market, and that demand was slowing in particular in Europe.","Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the industrial market to further moderate from current levels due to slowing demand, especially in Europe.","And for the full year of 2019, we now expect growth in the low-single digits, and this represents a modest reduction from our prior expectations. This slowdown is related to reduced demand outlooks from both our distributor and OEM customers.","Regardless of this further erosion of demand that we're now seeing, we remain very encouraged by the company's leading position in the industrial market. Through both our successful acquisition program as well as our organic initiatives, we have developed a very broad array of interconnect, sensor and antenna products across a diversified range of exciting segments within the global industrial market.","We're proud of the success and look forward to continuing to realize the benefits of our efforts in the industrial market into the future.","The automotive markets represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the automotive market were roughly as expected in the third quarter with sales increasing from prior year by 4% in US dollars, but down 2% organically. The organic moderation of sales was related to both the European and North American markets.","Sequentially, our automotive sales decreased slightly as the addition of GJM last quarter was offset by a moderation of demand from European automakers in particular.","Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect a slight decrease in sales from these levels. And for the full-year 2019, we now expect sales to be up only slightly from prior year. ","Regardless of the less favorable demand environment in the automotive market this year, I will just tell you that our position in this important market is as strong as ever. ","Customers around the world are continuing to design their new vehicle platforms with a wide array of electronic functionality, and we're working aggressively with those customers to design in our broadening portfolio of interconnect, sensor and antenna products on to their next generation vehicles.","In addition, we continued to work on a wide array of advanced vehicle technologies, including next-generation electrified drivetrains, autonomous driving systems and many others.","The mobile device market represented 15% of our sales in the quarter and our sales were much better than expected in the third quarter, growing a very strong 32% sequentially from the second quarter.","On a year-over-year basis, sales were down, although by a less-than-expected 21%, as growth in tablets and wearables was more than offset by lower sales related to smartphones and laptops.","Looking into the fourth quarter, we do expect sales to moderate from these levels. For the full-year 2019, however, we now expect the sales reduction in the mid-20% range, which is an improvement from our prior guidance of an approximately 30% reduction from prior year. ","This upgrade in our outlook is related to increased demand for our antenna, connector and mechanism products that have been designed in to new mobile platforms. And I can say that, as we drive toward the end of the year, our team will for sure remain poised as always to capitalize on any additional incremental demand opportunities that may arise.","I remain encouraged by our position in the mobile devices market. Our team is working on a wide array of next generation mobile devices, including smartphones, laptops, tablets, wearables and many, many other accessories. And we're confident that, in the long term, this market will continue to be a positive contributor to the company's overall performance.","Most importantly, though, our exceptional team remains the most agile, reacting to the inevitable changes that occur in the mobile devices market, which allows us to thereby secure both our market position as well as the company's financial performance.","The mobile networks market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter. Our performance was a bit better than expected in the third quarter, with sales decreasing only slightly in US dollars and flat in local currencies.","On an organic basis, our sales declined by 12% as the impact of the restrictions put on certain Chinese entities that we discussed last quarter more than offset growth that we did see with service providers in the quarter.","Sequentially, sales were down by 10% from the second quarter, largely related to the same dynamics that we discussed extensively last quarter.","Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect a further reduction of sales in the mobile networks market. And for the full-year 2019, we continue to expect sales to be flat to prior year in US dollars, but down in the high-single digits organically as benefits from our acquisitions are offset by a moderation in demand from both OEM and operator customers.","Regardless of the more challenging market environment here in 2019, we remain very confident in the long-term outlook for our mobile networks business.","Our leading-edge interconnect and antenna solutions have positioned the company strongly with both equipment manufacturers and operator customers around the world. ","As those customers plan for 5G and other network upgrades, we look forward to benefiting from our robust position as their partner. This creates a significant long-term expansion potential for the company.","The information technology and data communications market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter, and sales were down by a bit less-than-expected 9% in US dollars and 13% organically, with reductions in products sold into networking servers and storage hardware.","Sequentially, our sales were down only slightly from the second quarter as demand from OEMs exceeded our reduced expectations that we had coming into the quarter.","Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to moderate from current levels. And for the full-year 2019, we now anticipate a decline in the low-single digits from prior year, and this represents a modest upgrade from our guidance that we discussed last quarter. ","Amidst all of these current market dynamics, our OEM and service provider customers across the IT datacom market are continuing to push their systems and networks to ever-higher levels of performance.","Our ability to enable such performance through our next-generation, high-speed, fiber optic, power and other interconnect solutions has allowed Amphenol to be a leader in this market, and we're confident that we will continue to maintain that position over the long term.","The addition of XGiga this quarter significantly strengthens our offering for high-speed applications, adding active fiber optic interconnect to our already strong passive fiber optic and high-speed copper solution.","The broadband market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the third quarter grew by 11% sequentially, which was a bit better than we had expected. ","Compared to prior year, our sales declined by 5% as spending by broadband operators, essentially in all geographies, continued to moderate.","Looking ahead, we expect sales to moderate seasonally in the fourth quarter. And for the full-year 2019, we continue to expect sales to be down in the high-single digits from prior year on reduced investments by broadband operators.","Irrespective of this continued muted outlook in the broadband market, we remain encouraged by the company's still expanding range of products for this market which, together with our deep relationships with customers around the world, positions Amphenol for future success.","So, in summary, with respect to the third quarter, I just want to say that I'm very pleased with the company's performance in the quarter, especially given the high degree of uncertainty that remains in the world economy.","While we had come into this quarter with a more muted outlook, we were able to outperform those levels through excellent execution by our teams around the world.","The Amphenol organization has clearly continued to perform well in this very dynamic marketplace. And in particular, our long-term approach of growing both organically and through our successful acquisition program has resulted in us expanding our market position, while strengthening the company's financial performance.","And that superior financial performance is a direct reflection of the company's distinct competitive advantages. Our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in diverse markets, our broad worldwide presence, our lean and flexible cost structure, our highly effective acquisition program and, most importantly, our agile and entrepreneurial management team.","Now, turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year, considering the heightened level of uncertainty in the overall economy and, of course, assuming, as always, constant exchange rates, we now expect the following results.","For the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1.960 billion to $2 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.89 to $0.91. This represents a sales reduction versus prior year of 10% to 12% and a decrease versus prior-year adjusted diluted EPS of 13% to 15%.","For the full-year 2019, we now expect sales in the range of $8.035 billion to $8.075 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.65 to $3.67. For the full year, this new guidance represents sales and adjusted diluted EPS declines of 2% and 3%, respectively.","Regardless of this year's more challenging market environment, I just want to assure you that the Amphenol management team looks forward to driving strong results into the future.","Our team is aggressively pursuing a diverse array of growth opportunities, while reacting quickly to align costs with current levels of demand. This is the essence of the agile Amphenolian culture as embodied by that outstanding organization. And it is that team, coupled with our deep technology position with customers across our markets and complemented by our successful acquisition program, that positions the company very strongly for the long term.","And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there may be.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The question-and-answer period will now begin. Our first question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes, thank you. I have two quick ones. One is just on the guidance. You're not rolling forward the entire beat in 3Q into the full year for revenues. And I hear your commentary about the cautious backdrop macroeconomically, but can you bridge that delta, given the fact that there's a $120 million upside in the quarter relative to the midpoint of your guidance, but $80 million sort of flow through. So, that delta of $40 million, did you see some pull forward in the quarter or was it some other dynamic? And I have a follow-up.","Adam Norwitt","Yeah. Wamsi, you've done good math here. I would just point out a couple of factors. Number one, currency is a drag in this guidance compared to prior guidance, and not insignificant. I think somewhere to the tune of about 30-plus-million dollars of currency impact. We did have the positive impact of the acquisitions. I think as well, we talked about all the given markets. I won't go into each of the markets. I think I already spent a long time to discuss those.","But we feel very good about this guidance in its totality. When you think about the strength here across many of our markets compared to what we saw last time, I think this is a very strong guidance. ","The other thing I would just point out is that we had a higher-than-expected mobile devices results in the third quarter. And I think some of that came a little bit earlier than we would have expected, and it doesn't necessarily represent a full-year increase.","I think some of that is higher for the year and that's why we've talked about the year being down in the kind of mid-20s instead of 30%. But the strength that we saw here in the quarter, some portion of that may have also come out of the fourth quarter.","Wamsi Mohan","Okay. Thanks, Adam. And as a quick follow-up on your comments on mobile devices, can you give us some color on whether the incremental strength you saw was more on the variable side or on the mobile phone side? And any color that you can share around if it came from existing products versus new products or increases in content, that would be very helpful. Thank you.","Adam Norwitt","Yeah. No, thank you. I guess the short answer is kind of all of the above, Wamsi. I think we did see more-than-expected strength in smartphones, but also in wearables. And I would say it's on existing, but also, in particular, on new products. So, I think we've just seen a little bit better demand from a variety of customers across a variety of products. It is maybe the easiest way to answer that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is now open. Excuse me, Jim, please check your mute function. Your line is now open. Go ahead, Jim Suva. Your line is now open.","Jim Suva","Hi. It's Jim Suva here. When you mentioned the mobile devices, was it mostly on, like, unit volumes? Was it on your design-in features? Because I remember like six months ago, we had talked about changes in designs and things like that. And now, we're pleased that things are better. Just kind of curious about, was it more volumes or designs or a combination of both and how should we think about that? Because at the beginning of the year, I know there were a lot of questions around designs and content on the mobility side. Thank you.","Adam Norwitt","Well, I think, Jim, relative to our exceeding our outlook, I would just say that the mobile devices we saw strength really across platforms with a variety of customers, both on new and existing platforms, and that's a combination of new designs, existing designs on things like smartphones, wearables and otherwise.","So, it's not necessarily, at this stage, a change in architecture because I think we talked about that early in the year. And I think by the third quarter, most of those architectures are already well settled. So, I would credit this more with just better volumes and our ability, in particular, to meet those better volumes from customers, which is not the easiest thing in the world.","Our team, to come into the quarter with an expectation of kind of low double-digit sequential growth, but in the end to achieve a 32% sequential increase in sales in mobile devices, that requires an enormous amount of agility to ramp up in the face of that demand. And I'd just give an enormous amount of credit to our team to ramp up in the face of that. And as usual, the agility of our mobile devices team, I think, is really second to none in our company or across the industry.","Jim Suva","Thank you so much for the clarification. It's greatly appreciated.","Adam Norwitt","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","Shawn Harrison","Afternoon, everybody. And congrats on the strong results.","Adam Norwitt","Thank you, Shawn.","Craig Lampo","Thank you, Shawn.","Shawn Harrison","An easy one first and then a follow-up that's maybe not as easy. Craig, what were the actual restructuring charges taken in the quarter that I'm assuming don't repeat here in the December quarter?","Craig Lampo","Yeah. Thanks, Shawn. As you know, we typically really don't call out restructuring expenses. And they were included in our adjusted operating margin of the 19.7% and we don't call those out as non-GAAP items since, as we know, we hold ourselves accountable and our general managers fully accountable for these costs.","So, I guess what I would say from a perspective of magnitude, I'd say even considering these incremental costs incurred in the quarter, our year-over-year conversion on the third quarter, the relatively significant organic decline is still only slightly higher than the kind of normal downside conversion range. And as a matter of fact, to even answer a question you didn't ask, which is as it relates to the fourth quarter, which really doesn't have any significant costs in there related to restructuring of any magnitude, I would say that we do expect the year-over-year conversion as we step up into the fourth quarter on lower sales to be very strong and actually will have higher margins on a lower sequential sales amount.","Shawn Harrison","Okay. As a follow-up, Adam, what are you hearing from your distributors more on the industrial side of the business, particularly given this European weakness? Are you going to see inventory corrections persist well into 2020? Just any updated outlook you're seeing from your distribution partners in light of the incremental European weakness?","Adam Norwitt","Yeah. Shawn, you are the expert on this even more than I. But I will just say that the industrial trends today \u2013 industrial is the market that is more heavily distributed for us as you know well. The industrial trends are not the most favorable. I think we came into the quarter with a certain expectation. You'll recall, last quarter, we talked about the fact that, in the second half, we had anticipated previously a step-up in both the industrial and automotive markets. We then came to the conclusion through the course of the second quarter that that was not going to happen.","We saw that indication from our distributors and OEM customers. And I think, this quarter, it got maybe a little weaker on both fronts there again. And so, from the distribution perspective, our distribution sales in total were down on a sequential basis. ","We haven't seen from an inventory perspective that kind of big spikes or changes in the inventory, but I think the end demand is really flowing through the distribution channel in that way.","What does that mean going forward? It's always very hard for me to predict that. I think it's definitely too early to call a kind of a recovery in industrial market. I think you all see no doubt the same reports that I see. And I don't know that anybody is really calling that recovery, and I certainly wouldn't be the first to call it such a recovery. And so, as we head into next year, I think we're still \u2013 there is still a high degree of uncertainty about industrial demand trends, in particular, in Europe, but not only in Europe.","The European industrial market is intimately related to the automotive market. And I don't think it should come as any surprise that, as people thought the second half would have a recovery in automotive and then that didn't come, that ultimately manifests itself in less industrial equipment manufacturing and demand, and I think that's kind of what we're seeing here in the quarter.","So, when does that make its way through the distribution channel? What levels of inventories that the distributors ultimately conclude are the appropriate levels? I have a hard time to pin that down right now.","I think what is our team doing in the face of this? Well, we're doing what we always do. We're making adjustments where we have to make those adjustments. And some of our industrial operations have had to quickly react to that, having had different expectations coming into the second half of the year. And then, we're going out there and continuing to design in products with customers where there remains a very, very strong amount of industrial electronics design-in activities. And so, that level of new product innovation, working on new applications with customers, enabling next generation factories, enabling the electronification of all of these industrial equipment that we work on, none of that work has slowed. To the contrary, I would say that our industrial customers around the world are still seeking ways to create new functionalities, new capabilities with their equipment, and that's something that our teams are intimately involved in around the world.","So, like always, it's one of those times where we've got to get our costs aligned. We deal with what comes our way from our distributors and our OEMs, but we continue to focus on building next-generation products that can enable our customers' next generation systems.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Matthew Sheerin","Yes. Thanks. And good afternoon. I guess, Craig, a follow-up question on Shawn's question regarding the cost-cutting efforts and the margins. As you pointed out, you should be back over 32% gross margin and operating margin should be back over 20%, despite a couple hundred million dollar decline in revenue due to those efforts. As you look forward, and Adam talked about some areas of incremental weakness in some units, should we expect continued cost-cutting efforts at the operating level as we get into 2020? And given, as you said, those acquisitions total, I think, $500 million in revenue run rate, typically come in below the operating levels of the company, are there plans to see that or those margins improve as you get into next year?","Craig Lampo","Yeah, sure. No, thanks for the question. I think I would say, as we go forward, of course, if there is a significant shift in the demand environment that we're going to clearly take action. And our general managers, as they did in the third quarter, are going to clearly react to that and adjust the levels of their businesses to the reality of the demand environment.","We've taken the action today that we see given the current demand environment. So, I wouldn't say I would call out any current plans to make any significant changes in the next quarter or so. But this could change based on the current demand environment.","So, we're guiding to what we see. I'm not going to comment per se on 2020 yet. We'll talk about that in January as we see that. But, clearly, the game plan in terms of our playbook hasn't changed as it relates to our reaction and our adjustment in terms of the cost structure. But we feel pretty good about the actions that are taken today. We've done a good job and the general managers really did an outstanding job of reacting to the reduced demand expectations. And we do look forward to certainly realizing the benefits of those restructuring actions given the current demand environment and protecting the margins that we have.","Adam Norwitt","And the one thing I would add to that, Matt, is we don't talk about this, as you know, very often. I think the reason we did make some mention of it last quarter is there was a real sudden change in the third quarter outlook from what we had anticipated coming into it, not required a quicker and more magnified reactivity from our teams. We talked extensively 90 days ago about why we were reducing our outlook at that point because of the variety of factors related to the trade war, related to the automotive, industrial market, distribution and otherwise, and that did result in a significant reduction in demand for some of our operations which did require them to take a very quick actions, which they all did.","These are tough things. And we don't take lightly the actions that everybody took that dislocated people, that caused disruption, but I give a lot of credit to our organizations around the world who faced to that, that they were able to make it happen in the Amphenol way to take out the costs and to get out there, reallocating resources, so that we can continue to drive strong progress for the company going forward.","Matthew Sheerin","Okay, great. That's very helpful. And just a quick follow-up, Adam, just regarding the mobile network space, which was a little bit better, still down. You're guiding down sequentially. I know there's been supplier issues, obviously trade issues. What's your take on the 5G ramp as we head into next year? I know, recently, you've sounded a little bit more cautious in terms of the near-term opportunity.","Adam Norwitt","Yeah. Look, I think we're very excited for the long term with 5G. Our teams have done a great job of designing in a wide array of products into 5G systems with really the whole range of equipment manufacturers, working with operators around the world to ensure that when that spending does happen, we will be well positioned for it. And I feel very good about the position that we have put ourselves in.","What I am not so expert at is saying when is that spending going to come. There is already some 5G spending. No doubt about it. There are networks, test networks being put in place, there is drips of spending happening in a variety of places, no doubt about it. When will it have that overall impact that will be truly meaningful to the capital spending of service providers around the world? I think that's hard to say. I think a lot of it is really resting on the underlying economics of these networks. What are people going to be willing to pay more for and thereby support wireless operators to increase their capital spending? That dynamic is probably above my pay grade to determine when that happens, but all I can tell you is we will be ready when it does.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Mark Delaney","Hi, yes. Good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking the questions. First question for me was on the automotive market. Adam, you talked about the view for automotive for the full year sales being up slightly. And I think [indiscernible 0:44:19] low-single digits. Just trying to better understand, is that a downtick? If so, where are you seeing it? And any impact from the GM strike that may have impacted the automotive business?","Adam Norwitt","Yeah. Thanks very much, Mark. I'll just address the GM strike, first. It was not a meaningful impact. We obviously prefer for our customers to be producing stuff, instead of being on strike. So, happy to hear that there are resolutions in sight, but it was not a meaningful impact on our performance in the quarter.","I think the automotive market, if we looked at it in the quarter as it trended, it was very clear that, across the three regions, the most negative trending was in Europe where we were down sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, organically down. But really that trending in Europe seem to be the weakest of the regions. I would say that, in North America, the trending was maybe even a little bit pickup in the quarter and that's despite what we just mentioned. In Asia, it was essentially on par with the prior-year quarter.","So, I guess, of all the regions, we would feel a little less comfortable with the prospects in Europe right now. And then, the other two, we would feel roughly similar confidence across the two of them.","It's not an enormous change in our outlook here for automotive. I think, last quarter, we took down that outlook more significantly. I would just say, on the margin, it's a bit worse here as we look into the finish of the year. And as we look into next year, it remains to be same how that will come. We came into this year thinking the second half would be a step up and that everybody was kind of calling a bottom. I don't know really whether that is the bottom or what that overall trend is going to be going forward, but I just think it's probably still too early to tell how that industry really evolved over the coming quarters.","Mark Delaney","That's helpful. My follow-up question is on the mobile devices segment. Not looking for any 2020 revenue guidance, but just trying to think through the opportunity set for the company. Technology inflections like 5G are good opportunities for technical leaders like Amphenol to innovate. And you talked about some of the headwinds and architectural changes this year. But as you think about 2020, how are you thinking about that opportunity set in terms of some of the architectural design changes maybe becoming tailwind instead of a headwind as it relates to 5G?","As you're looking at that potential opportunity set, is there any opportunity for a much more diversified set of material customers in mobile devices for Amphenol in the 5G world? In 4G, the revenue had been at times concentrated to large OEM. And curious if you can be a bit more broad-based in the 5G world. Thanks.","Adam Norwitt","Sure. Thanks, Mark. Look, mobile devices market, you're asking me to talk about 2020 and I have a hard time talking about November. This is an inherently very difficult market to give an outlook on. As you know, I am dreadfully bad at it over a number of years. I guess, as we head into the end of this year and we look into next year, we would never get out in front of our skis in terms of an outlook for that market to be much more than a kind of a flattish outlook. It's very hard to give a prognosis of that.","But in terms of the long-term trends that you talked about, whether that's 5G, whether that's the higher mechanical complexity of devices, whether that is the different architectures that are being put into the phones, we still feel very good about the long-term prognosis for the mobile devices market, and that's coming off of a year here where we expect it to be down in the mid-20% range.","And why do we feel good about that is because we continue to see our customers driving to equip their mobile devices, whatever they may be, with more functionality for the customers. And we've talked about this for a long, long time that our position in the mobile devices rests on the presumption that our customers are going to want to make their products better, that these are not just kind of empty carriers of a standard software, but rather the ability to sell a phone to a demanding customer does depend in part on the customer's ability -- on our customer, the manufacturer's abilities to equip those products with new features.","And some of those features ultimately created demand for our unique high-technology products. And if our products can help make those ultimately devices more salable, more functional, having more use for the end customer, then our customers are going to share with us some of the value that we ultimately create. And that's the underlying philosophy of how we work in that market.","And so, as I think about the long term with things like 5G, with more complex devices, I feel very good about the long-term for that. But it doesn't take away from the inherent volatility of the market.","And so, as we come into next year, I'm going to try really hard to give an outlook that's dependable. And I probably won't do a very good job of it based on my track record. We have guided that market to be flat roughly, and we've been wrong every time. Luckily, we have been wrong to the good side of that more times than not. But this year, we were obviously wrong to the bad side of that, being down as we are in the kind of mid-20% range.","Relative to the customer set, there are only so many people who make these devices around the world and we work with all of them. And we will work with whoever that is that is driving the next successful range of products.","We've been successful in this market for such a long time. I remember when the leader in the market where people who today don't even make mobile devices and we were a leader then. And as that cycled through the variety of different companies who led the innovation and thereby captured the hearts and minds and wallets of their end customers, we were able to create a vibrant business that grew over the long term.","And so, regardless of which customers are successful in next-generation systems, we feel very good about our position.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is now open.","Steven Fox","Hi. Good afternoon. Just one question from me. Adam, just over the past 90 days, if you could sort of give us a sense of your perceptions on demand in China has changed or not changed? And also your ability to operate in the region, if there's been any changes? Are you concerned about any changes? Thank you.","Adam Norwitt","Thanks so much, Steve. Look, last time \u2013 at our last call, we had very extensive discussions, as you know, about China with respect to the Department of Commerce restrictions that were put in place on Huawei and other entities. And I think we said at the time that it was still very early and we were dealing with that as we always do by having a very, very strong local team. ","And I will just tell you that some of our outperformance this quarter was the result really of that local team stepping up and really doing a great job to satisfy some demand that was a bit higher than we had anticipated coming into the quarter, in particular in IT datacom and, to a lesser extent, in mobile networks.","The fact of us having a complete organization everywhere around the world and including in China where we have real leaders of the company who have every function under their supervision, totally accountable for everything that they do, designing products, ensuring the quality of those products, manufacturing those products, automating those products, interfacing with the customer, all on a local basis, has positioned us, on a relative basis, stronger than maybe some of our international peers who have more reliance on Western resources. And I think that has allowed us in the quarter to continue to reinforce to our customers, whoever they may be, that Amphenol will be there when you need us most. Obviously, we comply with every restriction and every law, but our nature of our organization is such that we're able to serve customers where maybe others would not. ","On the overall situation in China, look, we have said for a long time that we don't believe that these trade wars are a positive thing for anybody. We continue to look forward to a productive resolution to the trade war and we continue to be very happy that our business is very localized around the world.","We talked last quarter about the sort of sea change that may or may not be happening in the world between going from a global world to a local world, this kind of new world order that some are talking about it. And I will just say that we remain very, very happy with our kind of purpose-built organization here of local management, with local authority who work on a real local basis with customers.","And so, I think as we go forward in China, our local team will continue to service the heck out of their customers and make sure that those customers know that they're going to get the best of the best here from those individuals who don't have to necessarily rely on resources overseas to help them solve the problems that they need solved.","What will happen long term? Again, I'm optimistic for a peaceful and productive resolution of all these things, but we're prepared either way.","Steven Fox","Great. I appreciate that color. Thank you.","Adam Norwitt","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes, great. Thank you. Yes, Adam, so in the IT datacom business, can you talk about what you're seeing in cloud. I know kind of cloud, which was strong for a number of years, kind of wobbled a little bit early in the year. But just what you're seeing from those customers and if there's anything noticeable by region.","Adam Norwitt","Yeah. Look, we still are very happy with our position among all of these web service providers or cloud providers. Was there a little bit of a wobble as you term it? I guess there was a little bit of a wobble. But that's not abnormal.","We've talked about the dynamic being so different between a service provider and an OEM that \u2013 OEMs, they are in the business of kind of keeping a relatively steady manufacturing process going, and that can insulate the volatility of the end demand. Whereas, when you're dealing with the service provider, they want the stuff when they need it, and they don't want it when they don't need it, and that can create a level of volatility that we're very accustomed to. We were accustomed to it early on with our exposure to the broadband market, our exposure to the mobile networks market.","And so, as the IT datacom market has evolved to include a significant component of these service providers, our teams have really been able to react very quickly to those demands. And reacting quickly doesn't just mean that sometimes they don't need the product and you have to adjust your cost. It also means that you've got to ramp-up really quickly because sometimes they call you and they need a lot more stuff than you expected or that they expected because they've decided they're going to build a new data center and the work crews are ready that day and the weather is good and they're ready to build and you better get them the parts. And so, that reactivity is something that I think our team has done a really great job on.","Now, how does that market look right now? I'd say that it's relatively normal as it is today. Maybe early in the year, it was a little bit, again your term wobble, but I think that we see good demand from that market.","On a regional basis, I would say, it is more dominated by North America. Just the more famous cloud providers all tend to be the ones who are spending the most on CapEx and whatnot. Those companies do tend to be North American and then followed closely behind maybe in Asia, in particular in China, but I would say our business tends to be probably more heavily weighted in North America, which is not inconsistent with the weighting of where the money is being spent.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. Thanks for that. And if I could just ask a follow-up on the military business, phenomenal growth this year at 20%. Certainly, it would be tough to sustain at that level. But even if it were to decelerate from here, can you talk about maybe some of the dollar content drivers and visibility you have into military?","Adam Norwitt","Yeah. Well, I think you said it well. It's a phenomenal performance here, and I just can't can credit enough our team around the world working in the military market. This is not an easy market to achieve 26% year-over-year growth in. These are very complex products, very complex, long manufacturing processes, heavy degrees of manufacturing, vertical integration, the quality requirements, the technology associated with this product does not necessarily lend itself well to quick ramp ups of production. And I'd just give our team an enormous amount of credit for managing through this and really executing when the demand is there.","In terms of looking ahead, 20% year-over-year growth is very strong. We achieved that last year. We expect to achieve that here this year. I wouldn't expect that in perpetuity. These are very, very strong years. We're dealing with a lot of expansion, both of the budgets, but also of the content of electronics.","And as you talked about that content, to your question, we see increased content really across the board in the military. So, when you talk about a land vehicle and you look at all the systems, communications, electronic warfare, defense systems that go into a vehicle of today, I've had the good opportunity to walk into some of these vehicles and sit in them, and you feel like you're sitting in a data center, not in a tank or an armored personnel carrier. When you look at the airplanes of today, the next-generation fighter jets and the upgrades to prior generation fighter jets, again, just an incredible array of electronic systems that are being integrated into these next-generation platforms in order to create functionalities that didn't exist.","We see a lot of growth in the naval, for example, another area that I highlighted in my prepared remarks, again, putting high speed data transfer into naval applications where, in the past, you would not necessarily have had that.","So, I wouldn't say that there is any one part of the military market, which is disproportionately increasing in its content. We think the militaries around the world have woken up and said the electronics can help them do their jobs better, and I think ultimately that creates a good long-term opportunity for us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Will Stein of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","William Stein","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Two. First, Adam, you referred to the acquisitions you did this quarter as platforms. And I know that the company has a long history of M&A and maybe you've used this term before, but I wonder if there is any significance to that? Are they different from either a geo or a customer or a market perspective that would make these somewhat different from others that you've done in the last couple of years?","Adam Norwitt","Yeah. Actually, it's not a new word for me to term our acquisitions. And, in fact, it's a real criteria for us. Because if we're going to make an acquisition, we work very hard to generate the cash that we generate and we're happy to generate a lot of it this last quarter. To put that money to work in an acquisition, you don't do it just to bring the size of revenues in at the time that you bought it. That seems like a lot of work just to add revenues. ","We look for acquisitions that have great people, great products and great position, all of which help you to build a platform for that company to perform better as part of Amphenol.","And so, I use that term platform very broadly because it is a necessary precondition for us. We're not going to buy a company if we don't think it can become a platform to grow better its performance as part of the Amphenol family. And again, that can come through opening up new markets, new geographies, new customers, through the attachment of different technologies and the collaboration with other operations in the company or also a platform for profitability expansion by gaining access to Amphenol's ability and experience in low-cost areas, access to supply chain and otherwise. All of that can be a platform for accelerating growth and driving increased profitability, and that's what we always look for.","At the time these companies come in, sometimes they are, and maybe even oftentimes at lower margins than we are today, and I think Craig talked about that in terms of the impact on the conversion margins on a quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year basis, but we always look for companies that have potential far beyond where they perform today and that's to me the real essence of a platform.","William Stein","Great. That helps. I didn't recall the word being used before, but I understand that and appreciate the clarification. One more if I can. It seems pretty clear that the trade conflict is meaningful, maybe the majority or maybe all of the sort of problems we're facing now in the macro and as it influences your business. In your view, if we were to get a resolution on the trade conflict in the near term, would you expect demand to rebound strongly based on what you're seeing in, let's say, within the following year, like 2020? Or do you perceive maybe the tariffs have maybe damaged demand conditions for a more protracted period?","Adam Norwitt","Yeah. Look, this is a big question. But I will say a couple of things here. Number one, you referred to the fact that the trade conflict is really the root of all the problems. I don't know if I would 100% agree with that. You could have an academic argument over whether the instigation of the trade war ultimately led to uncertainty, which led to then other markets unrelated to the trade war to have some changes in their demand.","I don't know that the European automotive market, as one example, or the industrial market in Europe, I don't think that's directly related to the trade war. Could it have a secondary or tertiary impact? Sure. Trade wars have lots of impacts that you don't normally anticipate at the time that you launched them and that could very well be the case, but I don't know that those are directly correlated and linked to the US-China trade situation or to other trade situations that exist.","And thus, if there was a sort of grand bargain, a grand deal that resolved everything, I don't know that that is kind of the elixir that solves all the uncertainties in the world economy.","And to that extent, when you think about tariffs, tariffs have been a real hassle. There is no doubt about it. And I think our team has done a fabulous job of managing through those tariffs since they were put in place more than a year ago. And I give just an enormous amount of credit to our team to manage through that and we managed through that in the very sort of Amphenolian way, just case by case, part number by part number, operation by operation. Those were a hassle and a diversion and a lot of work that created stress in relationships and otherwise things like that, but I don't know that the tariffs themselves were the cause of overall changes in demand.","Now, we talked a lot last quarter about the restrictions that were put in place by the US, which may or may not be a component of the trade war and the tariffs. That clearly had an impact on demand. And I think when we looked at \u2013 or when we talked last quarter about the kind of knock-on effects of that demand expectations from customers who saw lower outlooks in China, does that get resolved if the trade war gets resolved? It depends, I think. I don't know what really the answer is to that. I would hope that some would, but I would not anticipate a big kind of snap back in the overall world economy if there were a sort of grand resolution. I think that has metastasized a little bit here and created a broader degree of uncertainty that is not just confined to the fact of one country or another putting tariffs on each other.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Giordano of Cowen. Your line is now open.","Joseph Giordano","Hey, guys. Good afternoon.","Adam Norwitt","Good afternoon.","Joseph Giordano","Hey. We kind of covered just a little bit on military, but maybe you want to come at it in a slightly different way. When I look at the last three years really, if I look at your guide as we go into the year kind of in that low to mid and then this year high and then obviously a huge ramp each year from that initial view, and I know you like to be conservative, I'm just curious about the level of visibility exiting this year relative to the last couple of years. Does it feel kind of the same?","Adam Norwitt","Yeah. The level of visibility \u2013 look, military has a little bit longer visibility than other markets. As you know, lead times are a little bit longer. Programs are a little bit more stable. All that being said, I can tell you that you're always just one spending cycle away and budgets get passed, and then they don't have necessarily the same degree of allocations to certain programs. That can always happen. But I think, from our customers, we do get a little bit more visibility than we would \u2013 certainly than in a market like mobile devices.","Look, if you look over the last three years, last year we grew 20%, the year before we grew 13%, this year we're going to grow around 20% and we came into the year with a more modest expectation. Do we have today visibility for next year? Not perfectly, for sure. I think 90 days from now, we'll try to give you our best estimate of what next year is going to look like. I would not expect it to be three years in a row, growing at 20%. I guess I can go out on a limb and say something like that right now, but we still think, long term, it has a very favorable trend.","Joseph Giordano","Okay. And then, Craig, maybe just quick, embedded in your current guidance on the margin side, how much, if any, is a tailwind from lower incentive comp, if there is?","Craig Lampo","Yeah. I would say that \u2013 that's kind of spread out throughout the year. And I wouldn't say it has a significant impact on the overall margin guidance. There is a lot of things that happen in the costs and sort of margin in a year like this. And I would say that's just one of many, I guess, things that are happening within the cost. But, certainly, we're going to have lower incentive disbursements than we had over the last year. And without a doubt, that's going to be lower this year. But I wouldn't necessarily call it out as a tailwind to the operating margins. That is something that is accretive to the bottom line of any significance.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Deepa Raghavan of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Deepa Raghavan","Hey, good afternoon, Adam, Craig. Hope you're doing well.","Craig Lampo","Thank you. Good afternoon to you, Deepa.","Deepa Raghavan","Yeah. Two questions from me, Adam. First off, looking back, when you guided Q3, did you really get the sense that macro reads were so bad that revenue would be down double-digit organic basis for Amphenol? You ended doing half of that, at down 6%. Or did you bake in a substantial amount of caution within, despite what the drivers were telling you? I think my underlying question, where I'm trying to go with this is, did mobile devices, IT and defense alone coming in better, intra-quarter, explain why you did better than the high end of your guide or was there a meaningful conservatism also?","Adam Norwitt","Look, we know, Deepa \u2013 we try every 90 days to give you and your colleagues the best estimate that we can on the basis of what we know at the time. And, obviously, last quarter, we came into the quarter on the heels of the significant changes that happened during the course of the second quarter that impacted IT datacom, that impacted mobile networks and that impacted, to some lesser extent, automotive and industrial. And those are really the markets last quarter that we saw as a much more negative than we had seen coming into than the second quarter.","The fact that we outperformed here in the third quarter in mobile devices and that also in military and IT datacom, and we outperformed in a few of the other markets, but I think you correctly point out, those are the three that probably moved the needle the most. I think it's just a testament to the fact that, number one, in mobile devices, it's a very hard market to predict. And if there is extra demand, our team is poised to take advantage of it on a moment's notice. And they did a great job of that.","On military, again, I would really credit here execution more than anything because I talked before about how hard it is to ramp up and our team just did a fabulous job of really satisfying customer demand and we weren't necessarily sure that we could do that going into the quarter.","And in IT and, to a lesser extent, mobile networks, I think we had taken \u2013 I don't know if you want to call it a conservative view, but we would call it a realistic view of our sales in \u2013 especially to some of the customers in China that we talked about. And we did a little bit better than that. And I think we didn't \u2013 it was hard to get a read at the time on what demand those customers would have because they had a real complex array of problems that they had to deal with in terms of availability of components and otherwise. And I think our local team just did a great job when they realized that there was more demand to satisfy that demand in a moment's notice.","And so, I wouldn't say that we came in and we're kind of overly cautious, but I think we gave our best view of the quarter, just as we're doing right now for the fourth quarter and the full year, and we're pleased that our team did a good job to do better than that.","Deepa Raghavan","Got it. That's fair. My follow-up is, to the extent you're able to share based on your conversations with your customers and how they are planning ahead, which of these end markets are your clients planning for weakness to extend well beyond this year and which are the ones are they planning for it to get better?","Adam Norwitt","Yeah. I think I've talked about a few of the markets already. And again, the last thing I want to do right now, especially in a year like 2019, is get ahead of myself in giving a guidance for 2020. 90 days from now, we're going to try to do our best to give you a guidance for 2020. But I think that's hard to do in the current environment. But I did, I think, already mention the fact that we would anticipate still continued strong demand in military, albeit maybe not at the levels that we talked about. It's hard to say in a market like industrial and automotive what really those trends are. If I had to say right now, I'd say that it's a relatively modest outlook right now. I think, in mobile devices, I wouldn't expect our business to be down as we expected this year by so much, but I also wouldn't ever get ahead of my skis on that market to say that that's going to be up by any measure. And I think I've talked about many of the other markets already.","But, look, 90 days from now, we're going to try really hard to give you a good outlook. There is still remaining a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace and we're going to be very thoughtful about that as we go through the quarter, collecting as much information as we can through our deep engagements with customers across all of our markets, and then we'll give it our best shot in January.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we have Michael Fisher asking a question in behalf of Amit Daryanani of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Michael Fisher","Thanks. Yeah. I was wondering, could you touch on gross margins in the quarter? I think it was down about 60 basis points. I was just wondering some of the drivers and if there is any of that kind of restructuring or cost savings plan items that hit the gross margin line?","Craig Lampo","Yeah. Thanks, Mike. I think that as it relates to gross margins, as you know \u2013 I'm not sure how long you've been covering the company, but we don't usually talk specifically about gross margins because we do measure ourselves really at the operating margin level, which really ensures attention, we believe, to all aspects of cost and certainly very pleased at the operating margin performance of the 19.7%, which I did mention earlier that we did have from restructuring items that did impact that performance in the third quarter.","I would note that most of those restructuring items, or the vast majority, certainly were impacting the gross margin line. So, there is some impact at the gross margin line as a result of those restructuring actions. So, I guess, I would not point out, I guess, anything specifically that's driving that other than maybe that. And certainly, I also have mentioned the acquisitions and the impact on the margin, the operating margin percentage and, ultimately, also the gross margin percentage on a year-over-year basis, which also is \u2013 would have some impact. Even though those certainly are accretive at the EPS level, they are having some impact at the margin and, therefore, gross margin level. But I do want to stress that we clearly try to drive all aspects of cost and, ultimately, drive operating margin versus just gross margin or SG&A.","Michael Fisher","Okay, great. Thanks. And then just one more. The weakness on the industrial side, can you maybe talk about kind of linearity of the trends we are seeing there? And then, maybe what was the delta between the trends from OEMs versus distributors? You had mentioned there were some different dynamics there.","Adam Norwitt","Yeah. Well, I think between OEMs and distributors, I wouldn't say that there were necessarily material differences to the dynamics in the quarter. In terms of linearity, I guess you mean through the course of the quarter, I wouldn't say that there was anything notable on the linearity of our industrial business during the course of the quarter. Did it weaken over the course of the quarter? I guess so. We talked to you 90 days ago which was close to the end of the first month of the quarter and we thought a certain thing, and by the end of the quarter it was a bit worse than that. So, I guess, one would say that there was a little bit of linear \u2013 lack of linearity that it got a little bit worse through the course of the quarter. Thus here we are changing our outlook in that market here again. But I wouldn't say anything real meaningful to either of those.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Samik Chatterjee of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.","Samik Chatterjee","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to start off on the content growth on the automotive side. I understand your comments on the automotive end market deteriorating a bit further. Just looking at kind of your organic guidance for this year. You're probably guiding to more like a 3% revenue decline organically. If I compare that to the global production outlook of down 6%, that outperformance or content gain seems to be a bit more moderated at what we've seen over the last couple of years. So, just wanted to understand if you're seeing any kind of push out of launches that's maybe impacting how you gain content this year as the volumes are lower? Or is there something else in terms of, like, the mix of geographies, et cetera, that's going on there?","Adam Norwitt","Yeah. Well, thank you very much. And I should extend a welcome to you to our call. I think you just picked up coverage yesterday.","Look, I think content growth in automotive continues to be very robust. We still see a lot of opportunities with customers. We're pushing new electronics into their cars of all types of platforms. And I mentioned some of those areas, things like new electronic drivetrains, some of those real far out things like autonomous driving and otherwise. But even more near term, there is just so much electronics, whether that's passenger infotainment, whether that's emissions control, engine control, whether that is different safety mechanisms that go into cars, you name it. I'd tell you, every car I get into and I rent a lot of cars because I travel a lot, and every one of these cars, it takes me a long time to figure out how to do a lot of different stuff because there's so many different features that go into these cars.","Craig and I were \u2013 just a few weeks back, we were in Europe and we ended up renting a car and we were in that car for way too long driving around Europe to lots of different operations. And there was about a two, three hour ramp-up time to learn all the different feature sets in that car. And each one of those things you're learning is a new electronic system that requires a certain degree of interconnect, sensor and antennas in order to enable that.","So, I would not say that we have seen any slowdown in the adoption of new electronics, and thus the content among automakers around the world. I think the fact that we are down this year organically roughly to the levels that you talked about, which is certainly better than the overall units, is a reflection of that content. But you should also bear in mind that whenever you have a reduction, the whole supply chain has to react to that reduction.","I think there's been lots of various companies talking about the whole automotive supply chain. It's a big supply chain. It's a supply chain that's been working \u2013 really going up into the right for close to a decade. And so, sometimes the impact can be a little bit more magnified on someone like us who is a little bit farther down the chain in certain of those instances. ","But we feel very good about our automotive market long term. When I just reflect back on the last decade, this is a market that, at the beginning of 2009, was a market that represented less than 5% of our sales. It was on a run rate of less than $150 million a year. And here it is 10 times that size over a decade.","And I think that real outsized growth that we've had in automotive has been not us taking business out of the hands of someone who already had that business. Rather, it was us capitalizing on new developments in cars, new electronics being implemented, not having new products together with the acquisitions that we've made to enable those next generation systems. ","And we don't see long-term that dynamic really changing at all. I think consumers still thirst for next generation functionality in their vehicles, regardless of what the drivetrain system of that vehicle is, regardless of the size of that vehicle, whether they're buying a sports car or a minivan, they want to have next generation electronics embedded in that system for passenger use, for safety, for fuel economy, you name it. And I think our company is very well positioned today to capitalize upon that.","Samik Chatterjee","Got it. If I can just quickly follow-up on the broadband segment, I think you mention it did come in a bit better than you expected, although customer spending continues to be kind of a challenge there. Is it that we should kind of think about some upside? Did kind of customer spending come in better? Or was it more kind of design wins that really kind of drove better-than-expected revenues for you?","Adam Norwitt","Yeah. I think it was just, first of all, small. It's a relatively small market, 4% of sales in the quarter. And, yes, we did a little bit better than we expected, but we're not talking about huge numbers here. And still, on a year-over-year basis, it was down. We didn't change our outlook for the year in the broadband market. So, I wouldn't say that there is anything meaningfully different in our overall view of that market here as we come into the fourth quarter.","Operator","Speakers, we show no further questions at this time.","Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much. And again, thank you all for all of your time today and we wish you all a great conclusion to the year. And I shudder to say that we will talk to you all in 2020. Thanks very much.","Craig Lampo","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for attending today's conference and have a nice day."],"2238":["Amphenol Corp.

White - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Operator","Hello, and welcome to the Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may now begin.","Craig A. Lampo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good afternoon. My name is Craig Lampo, and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We'd like to welcome everyone to our second quarter conference call. Q2 results were released this morning. I provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends and then we'll take Q&A.","The company closed the second quarter with record sales of $1.548 billion and EPS of $0.65. Sales were up $0.15 \u2013 15% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currencies compared to the second quarter of 2015. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the second quarter increased 4%. Sequentially, sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically.","Breaking down sales into our two segments. Our Cable business, which comprise 6% of our sales, was up 11% from last year, primarily due to the strength in the broadband market. The Interconnect business, which comprise 94% of our sales, was up 15% from last year, primarily driven by the impact of the FCI acquisition as well as organic growth. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.","Operating income increased to $300 million in the second quarter. Operating margin, excluding one-time items, was 19.4% compared to 19.7% at second quarter of 2015.","As discussed on our last earnings call, the FCI acquisition is accretive on an earnings per share basis, but reduces the company's overall operating income percentage as the business currently operates at a lower level of profitability than the average of the company. We continue to be very excited about the potential of the FCI acquisition and have begun to see improvement in their operating margins. We expect their operating income margins to continue to improve over time based on the combination of their excellent management team, leading technology and our strong operating discipline.","From a segment standpoint, in the Cable segment, margins were 14.9% compared to 11.8% last year. The increase in margin is related primarily to strong operating execution on additional volume, as well as the benefit from favorable impact of commodities. In the Interconnect segment, margins were 21.2% compared to 21.9% last year. The decline in the Interconnect operating margins reflects the impact of the FCI acquisition previously discussed.","We continue to be very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement. This excellent performance is the direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster high performance, action-oriented culture and which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions, and thereby, is maximized both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment.","Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance.","Interest expense for the quarter was $18 million when compared to $17 million last year, reflecting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the company's stock buyback programs. The company's effective tax rate was 26.5% in both the second quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2015, excluding one-time items. On a GAAP basis, the company's effective tax rate was 26.5% and 27.1% for the second quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively.","Net income was a strong 13% of sales in the second quarter of 2016. EPS was $0.65 and $0.58, excluding one-time items in the second quarter of 2016 and 2015 respectively. And on a GAAP basis, EPS was $0.65 and $0.56 for the second quarter of 2016 and 2015 respectively.","Orders for the quarter were $1.582 billion, a 16% increase over the second quarter of 2015, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02 to 1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $243 million in the second quarter or approximately 117% of net income. For the six months, operating cash flow was $438 million or approximately 119% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income.","From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $927 million at the end of June. Inventory days were 79 days, down five days compared to March. Accounts receivable was approximately $1.3 billion at the end of June; and days sales outstanding was 73 days, down approximately two days from end of March. Accounts payable was $645 million at the end of the quarter; and payable days were 55 days, flat compared to March.","The cash flow from operations of $243 million along with stock option proceeds of $66 million were used primarily to purchase approximately $59 million of the company's stock, to fund net capital expenditures of $47 million, to fund dividend payments of $43 million and to repay commercial paper borrowings of $33 million, which resulted an increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $112 million net of translation.","During the quarter, the company repurchased 1 million shares. 3.5 million shares remain available under the stock repurchase program through January 2017. At June 30, cash and short-term investments were $825 million, the majority of which is held outside the U.S.","At the end of the quarter, the company had issued $845 million under its commercial paper program and the company's cash and availability under the credit facilities totaled approximately $2 billion at June 30.","Total debt at June 30 was $2.8 billion and net debt was approximately $2 billion. In Q2 2016, EBITDA was approximately $362 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance.","Before I turn the call over to Adam, I wanted to make a couple comments relative to our guidance. We have issued updated guidance in the press release that increases our range of guidance for the full year from sales and diluted EPS excluding one-time items of $6.080 billion to $6.200 billion and $2.56 to $2.62, to sales of $6.120 billion to $6.200 billion, and EPS of $2.60 to $2.64, an increase in the midpoint of guidance of $20 million in sales and $0.03 in diluted EPS.","This updated guidance reflects the offsetting impacts of the negative impact of current FX rates, particularly the weakening of the euro, RMB, and pound, and the positive impact of our newly announced acquisitions. In addition, it reflects our current expectations for accretion from our January 2016 acquisition of FCI of $0.15 compared to $0.12 in our previous guidance. Our updated expectations for FCI reflect good progress in operating margin improvement. The management team continues to be fully committed to continuing to improve the FCI margins.","Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends.","R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, thank you very much, Craig. And I also like to add my welcome to that of Craig's to all of you who are here on the phone today, and I hope that you've all had a pleasant beginning to the summer so far.","As Craig mentioned, I'm going to spend a few moments just to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter. And in particular, I'll discuss some of the trends and progress in our various end markets. Finally, I'll make a few comments on the outlook for the third quarter and full-year 2016. And of course, we'll have time at the end for questions.","With respect to the second quarter, we're just so pleased that we reached new records in sales and orders and equaled our previous record for EPS. I'll just say that these achievements are particularly significant given the ongoing uncertainties that are still present in the worldwide economy.","Our revenues in the quarter increased by a very strong 15% in U.S. dollars and 4% organically, reaching that new record of $1.548 billion. And Craig alluded to the fact that we booked also record orders in the quarter of $1.582 billion and that represented a very strong book-to-bill of 1.02 to 1.","We're also really proud of the company's margins, which increased by 80 basis points from the first quarter to 19.4%. Really excellent achievement, especially in light of the currently lower margins of FCI that Craig detailed. And while those margins do remain below our average, we're excited to be starting to see improvements in the operating performance of FCI and that is reflected in our revised guidance for EPS accretion of approximately $0.15.","Operating cash flow in the quarter was also a very robust $243 million, which is a clear sign of the quality of the company's earnings.","I just want to say that I remain truly proud of our Amphenol team. Our entrepreneurial agility has once again enabled the company to achieve strong performance despite what are still very significant uncertainties around the worldwide economy.","And with respect to that financial strength, we're also very pleased that our financial position has enabled us to complete two acquisitions just in the last week. First, AUXEL FTG is a France-based manufacturer of high-technology power interconnect solutions for both the industrial and IT datacom markets. And AUXEL has sales of approximately $50 million per year. AUXEL, which has facilities in France and Germany as well as production in China and India, is a real leader in value-add power interconnect and busbars and represents an excellent complement to our already broad array of high reliability power interconnect products.","Custom Cable, the other acquisition we announced today, is a U.S.-based manufacturer of fiber optic and copper cable assemblies, in particular for the enterprise and carrier datacenter market. And that company has annual sales of approximately $30 million. With Custom Cable's outstanding service and their great product offering, together with our existing array of high technology products, we really look forward to being able to better capitalize on the interconnect opportunity within the fast-growing data center space.","Let me just say that as we welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, we remain very confident that our successful acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. It is in fact our ability to identify and execute upon acquisition opportunities and successfully bring those new companies into the Amphenol family that represents a real core competitive advantage for the company.","Turning to our progress across our served markets, I'll just comment that our company's extremely balanced and diversified end-market exposure is really a great asset, in particular during economic times like today. In fact, we're really pleased that in the second quarter not one of our markets represented more than 20% of our overall sales.","Starting first with the military market, military market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were down slightly in U.S. dollars and local currencies from prior year as growth in avionics, airframe and space applications was offset by its slower sales in military vehicles, communications and rotorcraft. Sequentially, the sales were flat from the first quarter.","As we've talked about last quarter, we expected and in fact, that's what happened, that our sales were impacted by the Defense Logistics Agency's stop shipment order that we reviewed with you. Our team continues to work on the recovery from the DLA stop ship. And we are actually encouraged by our progress thus far and have actually just recently been able to secure a lifting of the stop ship on certain products. Nevertheless, our expectations for the financial impact of the DLA issue remain consistent with what we discussed last quarter.","Despite this continued short-term regulatory challenge, we remain very encouraged by the company's performance in the military market. For the third quarter, we expect sales to increase from these current levels and we continue to anticipate modest growth for the full year 2016, even with the impact from the DLA issue.","I'll just tell you that Amphenol remains the leader in military interconnect technology with the broadest range of high technology products across virtually all defense equipment, and that's the position of strength that we look forward to building upon into the future.","The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market were down by 5% from prior year, as stronger sales on some new airplane platforms were offset by continued reductions in commercial helicopter and business jet-related sales.","In addition, we did see in the quarter some impact of the DLA stop shipment on certain military specification products that are used in commercial air applications, and in particular, sell-through distribution. As expected, our sales were down slightly from the first quarter.","Looking ahead into the third quarter, we do anticipate a moderate increase in sales sequentially and we continue to expect growth for the full year 2016, as production volumes of new airplane platforms ramp up. The commercial air market is really an exciting space for Amphenol. With our strong technology position with customers around the world, together with the proliferation of electronics on new aircraft platforms, as well as the increasing production volumes of such airplanes, we are very confident for the long term in this exciting market.","The industrial market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew by a very strong 19% from prior year, driven by contributions from the FCI acquisition as well as by growth in the hybrid bus and truck, battery, alternative energy, rail mass transit and medical segments. Organically, sales increased by 2% as growth in these segments was offset by declines in our sales to oil and gas and heavy equipment customers. Sequentially, our sales growth is expected by 5% from the first quarter.","Now with the acquisition of AUXEL, we have today the broadest range of power interconnect products into the industrial market, including a wide array of value-add solutions for both high and low-voltage applications.","For the third quarter, we anticipate sales to remain at these levels. And we continue to expect very strong sales growth in the industrial market for the full year as we benefit from the contributions of FCI and now AUXEL, together with organic growth from a range of segments within the industrial market.","We remain very proud of our diversified industrial business as we continue to make progress in selling in ever broader range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products into this important space. And our position in the industrial market is really stronger than ever and that's despite continued uncertainties across the global industrial market.","The automotive market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by 10% in U.S. dollars and 4% organically. And this was driven by continued progress in penetrating new interconnect and sensor applications in both traditional as well as hybrid electric vehicles. Sequentially, our sales increased by 4% in the quarter.","Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to remain at or slightly above these levels due to normal summer seasonality. And for the full year 2016, we remain confident to achieve continued strong growth in the automotive market. Our long-term outlook for the automotive market remains very positive.","With our continued expansion of automotive interconnect sensor and antenna products; we are participating in a very broad range of new vehicle electronic systems. In addition, we now have a more balanced position geographically than actually ever before in the company's history, and this positions us to capitalize on growth opportunities around the world. We look forward to realizing the benefits of that strengthened position from many years to come.","The mobile devices market represented 14% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were up slightly from prior year, as increased sales of products into laptops and accessories were offset by reduced sales into smartphones and tablets.","While we grew by a very strong 15% on a sequential basis, this was a bit less than we had anticipated coming into the second quarter. And in fact, we've recently seen a moderation of customer expectations for a range of different mobile devices for the remainder of 2016 and this includes smartphones as well as other mobile computing devices such as tablets and laptops.","Accordingly, while we expect sales to increase again in the third quarter by approximately 10% from current levels, we now expect our full year sales to decline by more than from 2015 levels.","Regardless of this more challenging outlook for 2016, we remain extremely confident that our dynamic agile team has positioned us to benefit from any increases in demand that may still arise in this very dynamic market. We're confident that our highly reactive organization will continue to secure a strong position in the mobile devices market and are actually encouraged by our excellent technology positions that are across a wide range of next-generation mobile computing platforms.","The mobile networks market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were better than expected in the second quarter, growing from prior year by 29% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically, as we benefited from the contributions of FCI, as well as stronger sales of interconnect and antenna products to OEMs and network operators in several geographies. Sequentially, our sales increased modestly from the first quarter.","We're very pleased that our growth accelerated here in the second quarter and it's an excellent confirmation of the success of our efforts to expand our position with mobile network service providers and equipment manufacturers around the world. This growth is a great confirmation of our ongoing drive to develop next-generation products that enable the continued proliferation of mobile broadbands.","Looking into the third quarter, we expect a slight moderation of sales on normal seasonality. Nevertheless, we now expect to achieve low- to mid-single-digit organic growth for the full year 2016, which, together with the very strong contributions from the FCI acquisition, we expect to result in an excellent growth year for mobile networks market.","Turning to the information technology and data communications market, this market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. Our performance in this market was also stronger than expected in the second quarter, as our sales grew 38% in U.S. dollars and 5% organically. This performance was driven by strength in networking as well as further progress that we have made with new data center and web service provider customers. Our sales increased a very robust 12% sequentially, essentially all organic.","Our team, focused on the important IT datacom market, is just doing outstanding job of positioning Amphenol across a broad range of customers with the widest array of high technology products, and in particular, with the new products from FCI. We're supporting our traditional and new customers in their ongoing quest to upgrade their equipment to handle dramatic increases in data traffic around the world.","We're particularly excited that the acquisition of Custom Cable strengthens our position with both enterprise and carrier data centers, and it represents really an excellent addition to our growing offering in this important part of the IT datacom market.","In addition, AUXEL further bolsters our leading suite of power interconnect products for the IT datacom market, an increasingly important technology area as data center operators strive for more efficient power consumption for their equipment.","Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect sales to increase from these levels. And we remain confident in achieving strong double-digit growth for the full year 2016 with the contributions from FCI and these new acquisitions, together with our organic performance.","Finally, the broadband market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter, and we're very pleased that sales increased from prior year by a strong 13% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currencies as cable operators accelerated their investments to accommodate upgrades in network performance. All of this growth was organic. Sales from the first quarter grew by a very robust 11% sequentially.","For the third quarter, we expect the seasonal moderation of sales. But nevertheless, given our strong performance here in the first half, we now expect to achieve mid-single-digit growth for the full year 2016 in the broadband market.","We're pleased to be benefiting from the renewed investments in next-generation capabilities by cable operators, especially in light of the many challenges we witnessed over the last couple of years amidst the wave of customer merger activity in this market. Our team in the broadband market is now capitalizing on our expanded range of interconnect and cable products, as well as our excellent position with broadband operators around the world and we think this positions us very well for the long term in this important space.","So, just in summary, I just can tell you that I'm extremely proud of our company's record results here in the second quarter. And while the global market environment remains uncertain, the Amphenol organization is executing extremely well through our dual-prong strategy of strategic acquisitions and organic growth, all of which is enabling us to expand our market position while strengthening the company's financial performance.","Amphenol's superior performance is really a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages: our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across a diverse array of end markets, company's worldwide presence, a lean and very flexible cost structure, and most importantly, our agile entrepreneurial management team.","Turning to our outlook, based on the continuation of the current economic environment and assuming constant exchange rates, we now expect in the third quarter and full year of 2016 the following results.","For the third quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1.543 billion to $1.583 billion, and EPS in the range of $0.67 to $0.69 respectively. This represents sales and EPS increase versus prior year of 6% to 8% and 3% to 6%. For the full-year 2016, we now expect sales in the range of $6.120 billion to $6.2 billion and EPS, excluding onetime items, in the range of $2.60 to $2.64. For the full year, this represents sales and EPS growth, excluding onetime items, of 10% to 11% and 7% to 9%, respectively, over 2015 levels.","We're very encouraged by the company's robust outlook for 2016 and we look forward to driving further strength going forward despite the many ongoing dynamics in the global economy. I am confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon our strength and to continue to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability in 2016 and beyond.","With that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Mike Wood from Macquarie Group. Your line is now open.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Congratulations on good quarter results. First question maybe I'll just ask about, your pipeline in automotive, just what you're seeing with some regional color, if you'd expect any impact as the comparisons with the incentives there start to rollover and potentially any European thoughts on production after Brexit?","R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, thank you very much, Mike. Look, our auto business is continuing to just perform extremely well and we're just really happy about the progress that we've made over a many year period. I've talked about it in the past, the strategy that we have of finding complementary acquisitions, together with really driving into new electronics in the car with our organic product suite. And I think that continues to create a very, very strong pipeline.","From a regional perspective, what we're just so proud of now is we have transformed that business from what was a clear majority European business with a minority North America and a very small presence in Asia, to now a business that is much, much more balanced. In fact, it's just over 40% or so in Europe and then equally split roughly between the other two regions. And I think that gives us exposure regardless of where the developments are and regardless of where the ultimate volumes are going to be.","With respect to the incentives that may be in certain areas, I don't know necessarily that we have seen a big impact or whether we expect to see a big impact from those incentives. The ones that are most widely talked about are in China. They have traditionally to do more with smaller cars that tend to have a little bit less content than maybe some of the larger cars.","If I look at our performance in the second quarter, actually, we had our best performance in Europe, where we had strong growth in the European market, both organically as well as with acquisitions. And we had also good performance in Asia and modest, let me say, performance in North America. And again, I think it's a credit to both the OEM diversification that we have, the regional diversification that we now have, and the application diversification, because we're seeing that growth across a wide array of different applications. And that is interconnect and sensors as well.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. And it was good to see the FCI accretion increase. Curious if you've had any conversations yet with the distributors about leveraging the Amphenol product suite with the distributors where FCI had strong relationships and if you have any expectations about that?","R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We've had a lot of conversations with distributors. I personally have had many of them and our team has had multiples of what I have had. And what we saw early on from the date of announcement and that has continued and I will say even ratcheted up is a great enthusiasm from our distributors on two fronts.","Number one is, they have always had an affection, affinity, and loyalty towards FCI, but they had always a little bit of a cloud hanging over it in terms of the prior ownership. Whenever you're owned by a financial sponsor, your partners always have a little bit of a question mark. And I can tell you that every distributor just stood up and applauded when we were ultimately the company that was the ultimate home of FCI.","But the second and more important is, FCI has positioned us with those distributors in just a very, very different way than we have been in the past. In the past, we have always been known by the distributors from our original legacy with them, which is in the harsh environment, military, industrial products, and that's where the history came. Even if we have diversified our products over time, we struggled to diversify them in certain of the commercial areas, the more high-tech telecom, IT datacom type areas, which are still very important for those distributors.","Well, on the contrary, FCI was extremely well-positioned, and that was the area where they were positioned with these distributors. And so, what we have already seen is really great momentum in elevating the prominence of total Amphenol at those branches where traditionally we were not necessarily the first name to their lips when they were going to their own customers. And I think that elevation of the prominence at those branches which are more associated with telecom, with datacom applications, that will for us create great long-term opportunities to really cross-sell the broader suite of Amphenol products.","Does it happen in a six-month period? Not necessarily. But do we already start to see the kind of green shoots of that coming up? We do, indeed. And I can only attest to the level of interaction and the enthusiasm of the interaction that we see with all of our distributors that gives me great confidence that in the future we will really see strong benefits from that combination.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I have two questions as well. I guess starting off on the mobile devices side. Adam, could you just talk about the softness that you're seeing in the back half of the year? Is that a reflection of what's happening in the end demand in end markets or is it more a reflection of maybe share shift that's a little bit against you right now and that's impacting you?","R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, no. Thanks very much, Amit. I think we have seen in the mobile devices, as you know, we came into the second quarter with an expectation of being down for the year in the sort of mid-single digits range and, today, we see that being down somewhere in the 10% range approximately. And that was reflected in part with a somewhat less ramp-up that we saw in the second quarter, we were up about 15%. I think we had originally talked about being up around 20%, and then also some modest reductions here in the second half.","We see that really all as changes in the overall demand as it's being now forecast to us from our customers. It's not that we're losing anything of any note. You're always winning and losing certain things in that space, let me say that. But overall, we have seen that just a more modest expectation from customers really across the board from their earlier forecasts.","When we look at the mobile device market for the year being down, there's no doubt we prefer it not to be down and we're not happy about that. When you look at the trends, we've had years in the past where the second half is a very significant uptick from the first half and we've had other years where it's a somewhat less significant uptick from the second half. And I think this year in mobile devices, our second half as we've currently guided it is going to be up in somewhere in the teens.","And we've had years where it's been in the high-teens, low-20s. We've had other years where it's been like last year much more substantial. And the cadence of the market, do you see more growth in the second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, we've had even years in the past where the first quarter was not so bad. Every year that changes a little bit. But overall, what we see is a more broad-based reduction in expectations.","Now, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, this is not an easy market to forecast. And our team, no doubt about it, is poised for whatever opportunity to do better than that may come their way. And it's always been the agility of the team that in the end has allowed us to remain strong with our customers. Because in the end, customers want somebody there who can react to those quick changes, satisfy the upticks in demand, and deal with the moderations in demand if they come, and in that market, they tend to come when you least expect them.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Fair enough. That's really helpful. And if I could just follow-up on the FCI integration. I think you guys are raising the accretion by about $0.03 for the full year from $0.12 to $0.15. Just wondering, is that a better demand reflection from FCI or is the margin improvement in FCI much better than what you guys \u2013 or somewhat better than what you guys thought it would be? And to the extent, you can talk about the eventual potential of FCI margins versus what Interconnect average is?","R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think it's not a demand necessarily. We're happy with the demand. And I would say the demand is really meeting \u2013 the top line of FCI is really, at a minimum, meeting with our expectations. We've just seen better operating performance as a company. We've started to see better operating performance, we expect to see better operating performance and that's what's given us the confidence to raise our outlook for the accretion of the company.","We still have a long-term goal, as we always do and as we widely communicated, to have FCI perform at the same levels of the rest of Amphenol. And we certainly don't lose sight of that goal and we have confidence long term to reach that goal. When does it ultimately get there? That's something that is still too early to say, but the early returns and the performance of the team is really fantastic and we're just so pleased with how they have not just embraced being part of Amphenol, but actually embraced what it means to be part of Amphenol. And that high performance culture, they have bought into that, embraced it, and become one with it in a time period that is really somewhat beyond our original expectations.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you for taking the question. Just following up on FCI and especially the increased exposure on the IT datacom. There is a lot of changing dynamics to that landscape. So, Adam, we're just hoping you can kind of discuss kind of what they do for you and what you're seeing from kind of a customer traction perspective particularly in the data center?","R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. No, I think it's a really important point, and we talked about the fact that at the time we announced the acquisition that FCI really bolstered our position in the IT datacom market from two perspectives. One, from a product perspective, where they had just a great rounding out of some of our products on the high speed, on the backplane, very incremental progress from a power perspective and IO and then the unbelievable array of board level products that are just really fantastic from FCI. So, from a product technology perspective, we just have today a much, much broader array of products for customers in that space.","As it relates to the market side, in addition to the products, we had very complementary customer base in fact. There were certain customers where we were both well-positioned, but there were most customers where one of us had a better position than the other. And whether that was regional where they, for example, had some stronger positions at certain customers for example locally in China, we had maybe certain customers that were a little bit stronger here, they had some very good customers on the data center, the web service provider, we had others, but there wasn't really an overlap there.","So, it just \u2013 not just rounded out, but strengthened and bolstered and broadened our position. And you're absolutely correct, the IT datacom market is going through tremendous, tremendous change today and it's not for the faint of heart. You see that around the industry. If you just hang your hat on the traditional OEMs, the traditional places where the orders used to come, the orders then are not going to come at the same pace you used to get them. You've got to pivot. And I think with that broad product range, with the channel, with the presence with other customers, as well as with our innate agility of our team, we've just done a fabulous job in that pivot towards where the opportunity are.","I think what's clear is the overall opportunity, the market opportunity for IT datacom is still an exciting one, it's just a very, very different one than it was in the past. If you look at our performance last quarter, we grew 38% together with FCI, but we also grew 5% organically. And clearly, that is a different level of performance than you see overall in the industry and no doubt with the broad range of OEMs in that space. And that growth is a reflection of not just excellent agility that our team has displayed here, now with also a broader range of weapons to attack.","So, it's a place that we're excited about. Like any market, I wouldn't want to be 100% in IT datacom, but that's the beauty of the diversification of the company and the diversification even within that space.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks for your color there. And then just as a follow-up on kind of the hybrid and EV battery opportunity. There's been some noise of some potential slowing, and I know in these kind of new technologies as they're adopted, it could be kind of fits and starts, as to kind of the growth. But can you just give us a sense in terms of how you see that market developing and have you seen much volatility to that hybrid or EV opportunity?","R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think in any space, as you correctly point out, as the market is evolving, there is volatility. I think there is actually volatility in most markets, most times right now anyways. We're not in a Steady Eddie kind of a macroeconomy today. And I think the hybrid EV space is no different. There is a tremendous amount of innovation happening and there is a lot of opportunities to intersect new demand for new functionality from customers and it's kind of all over the place. There're so many places where you need to target those customers. And I think it gets down to the nature of our organization. The fact that we have general managers in certain places around the world, whether that's in China, in Europe, in North America, who are focused on their customers reacting quickly to those customers, retooling products, redesigning products, designing new products, as appropriate, that has positioned us well very.","I think the other thing that we've seen in this space is there is a real demand for a comprehensive interconnect and sensor solutions. And that's something that our team has started to do a real excellent job on. And will all of those applications that we work on ultimately results in something that is mass produced in volume on a stable fashion for a long time period? No, absolutely not, but well some of them, no question about it. And our approach in times like this in these very dynamic times is to really maximize our presence with as many customers as possible, with as many of our products as possible such that whoever the winners and losers may be as the market shakes out, we're going to be positioned with them. And that's the approach we've followed in the mobile market over many years. That's the approach we followed in the datacom market. And it's an excellent approach here for this exciting space today.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You line is now open.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. So, Adam in the mobile device segment, can you comment on that incremental five points of weakness for the year. If you could categorize that between like lower demand on any inventory correction. It sounds as though smartphone demand is pretty weak but PC demand actually was a little bit better in 2Q. Do you think that there was some pull-in, because of that, that's now leading to a little bit sharper decline for the remainder of the year? And I have a follow-up.","R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, again, what we're talking about here is a reduction in our outlook, not a reduction in the sales. We still expect mobile devices to be up in the second half and up by, as I said, somewhere in the mid-teens range, second half to first half. But it is a reduction in what our customers have been telling us 90 days ago. Is some of that related to inventory build or not? I actually don't have enough visibility into the various pieces of the supply chain to be able to tell you whether there is inventory build. Nothing that we have seen that kind of \u2013 is so obvious.","But could there be \u2013 certainly there could be \u2013 but that is not really what we see beyond just hearing from our customers that their overall demand is less than they said it was going to be one quarter ago.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks, Adam. And then have you seen any order pattern changes post Brexit? Has that actually really had an impact, or is it just too early to say anything about it? Thanks.","R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I don't think we've seen any order pattern changes. I think Craig gave a very concise review of some of the FX changes and how those have impacted our overall guidance and that clearly happened on the day after this faithful vote. And I think as Craig mentioned, that had an impact roughly for the full year of somewhere to the tune of $35-million-or-so reduction of our full year outlook. And fortunately we've made these two acquisitions, which essentially offset that in our guidance.","But in terms of order patterns or customer conservatism or changes from our customers of any real significance, I don't know that we've seen that. I think there's no question that there's unease around the world even before Brexit, and Brexit does not reduce the amount of money. What does that ultimately translate into, that's hard for us to say at this point. And we'll be watchful of it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is now open.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Good afternoon, Adam and Craig. Just regarding your commentary, Adam, on the automotive and the fact that you're becoming more geographically diversified there. Could you elaborate that and run by us the numbers percentage by geo and maybe your outlook for each segment? TE Connectivity this morning talked about perhaps slower growth in North America versus perhaps stronger demand in Europe and China. I'm just wondering if you're seeing similar patterns?","R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think I mentioned earlier that we are very pleased with our balance geographically and that in the last quarter, actually Europe represented just a bit more than 40%, and Asia and North America were roughly balanced on the remainder of that. And I think I also mentioned that Europe was our strongest growing region, followed by Asia and then North America.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And just the trends in North America in terms of your share and your content growth offsetting perhaps (46:37) share production numbers, are you still confident that you're going to grow here?","R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think, look, our share overall in the automotive market is still really small. So, while we've grown a lot in the automotive market, we still have a relatively minor position and that's what's so exciting for us, is that there is still so many electronic applications that are coming. And as each new thing comes along, that's a new opportunity for us to create a renewed platform for growth. And I think we see that in North America as much as we see that in Europe and in Asia.","As it relates to our performance in North America, related to the SAAR and the overall volumes, we don't have a strong view on what SAAR will be this year and what the impact of that will be on us. I think we expect still to have strong performance in North America for the year. Although I guess at this point, we would expect Europe and Asia to be a bit stronger.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from William Stein from SunTrust. Your line is now open.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thank you for taking my question, and congrats on the very strong quarter and good outlook.","R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I'm hoping you can talk about the incremental margins going forward \u2013 they were very strong in the quarter. It seems clearly that's going to improving performance within the FCI business and that's expected to extend into September. For how many quarters \u2013 or maybe said another way do you expect that to continue into 2017 to get this sort of upsized contribution margin?","Craig A. Lampo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. I think, as it relates to 2016 and the second quarter, we're really pleased with the company's profitability achievement and we continue to be committed to achieving operating income margin expense and we've really done that in the last couple of years.","Moving to 2016, as we've discussed, we've had an overall level of ROS and conversion margin that, although negatively impacted by the inclusion of the FCI that's at the lower \u2013 our company average, from kind of an organic perspective, we've really converted quite well into the second quarter. And certainly part of that strong sequential margin improvement that we've had 30% sequential quarter conversion into the second quarter, 80 basis point improvement, part of that really does relate to our organic business.","I'm not going to talk about so much about 2017. We certainly still see improvement potential in the FCI business, and certainly that will happen over time, which essentially equates that happening into 2017. But I think right now, we're really happy with where we are. We performed at a very good level. And going forward I would expect, as you look at our guide for the second half, our conversion will continue into the second half of the year.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. And then a follow-up, if I can, on M&A. Earlier this morning when TE Connectivity announced results, they announced a couple of smaller acquisitions that are frankly a bit more reminiscent of the types of deals Amphenol does. And as a result, it sort of begs the question whether there is incremental competition. I'm aware that these deals are not predictable; you can't certainly predict to close one every quarter for example and that they're subject to all sorts of market and even sometimes family conditions. But when I think of the pace and the pipeline, are you seeing incremental competition for your deals?","R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, let me just comment. We made and announced two acquisitions this morning, outstanding companies. I discussed both AUXEL and Custom Cable. These are two excellent companies that represent opportunities in very exciting markets for us with really complementary product technology and service offering into those spaces. And together, they represent an annual sales value of about $80 million. And those are just outstanding companies.","Are there other companies making acquisitions? I think this is nothing new. Others have made acquisitions of many companies in the past. And whether that's the companies that you follow or otherwise, we're not the only company who has ever made acquisitions in the interconnect market. And we will continue to not be the only company. But what we are is a company who has developed an organic strength in acquisitions that we believe is really second to none.","If you look at our track record over a long time period, and we think in acquisitions, in very long time period, if you look at us over a very long time period, we have acquired somewhere north of 60 companies in the last 10, 15 years. Each one of them outstanding companies with great people, great technology and really complementary market position. And we have paid, over time, what we consider to be very fair prices, not that they are low or high, but they are fair prices. In the case of the acquisitions today, for those $80 million in sales, we paid roughly one times sales for those companies. And these are extremely high technology companies that we have brought into the company.","And so are we going to win every auction? Are we going to be the first at the door of every company that ever comes out? No. But look, the beauty of the interconnect industry is how rich of an industry it truly is for acquisitions. There is a constant wellspring of new companies that are coming up, smaller companies that are becoming larger and midsize companies that become larger there again. And our approach, both organizationally and also from an execution perspective, is just a really, really, compelling approach for those companies. And the right companies, we're still very, very confident to win those companies and to bring them into the Amphenol family over time.","And you correctly point out that every quarter, you cannot predict are you going to get a deal done or not but we have a very strong pipeline of acquisitions and a great reputation among companies in the industry as a place that represents an outstanding ultimate home for those companies long term.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Shawn Harrison from Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Good afternoon, Adam.","R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Shawn.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Wanted to, I guess, dig in a little bit more to the commentary on mobile infrastructure, and it sounds like a more bullish view. Is it something that you're seeing globally or is it anything that you're seeing particular region, be it China coming back or Europe or North America getting a little bit better?","R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think in this quarter, we saw probably better performance in Europe on an organic basis than we saw in other regions. We saw a strong performance also in Asia. And we had growth in North America but the most robust part of that performance clearly was in Europe. Look, our performance in mobile networks is just a great example of the fact that when the chips are down, we don't just throw them on the table and run away. In fact, we know that in a space like that, there are cycles. Last year was clearly a down cycle, the year prior was a good cycle and two years before that were not great cycles.","And regardless of what the given cycle of the day is, we know that the ultimate demand for mobile networks comes from the rapid acceleration of the proliferation of mobile broadband, and that continues unabated. When do operators spend their money, on what do they spend their money, what are the nature of the architecture of the various systems that they're using, where are the constant opportunities for us. Those are all things that are changing on a constant basis. But they're all ultimately paying homage to and servicing an end demand which appears to continue to grow without limit.","And so, our strategy is just a very simple one, continue to broaden our product offering, continue to work with customers at every geography and across service providers and equipment manufacturers to make sure that we are really the first phone call for them and there with them on the day that they want to design that next-generation system. Maximizing our position, maximizing our content on that equipment that they need so dearly to ultimately support the demands of the networks.","And I think, I really give a lot of credit to our team. It's not easy to do that when your sales are down like they were last year by 18% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies. But the team did a fabulous job. And I think the fact that we've seen now two quarters of strong performance, really indeed accelerating performance when you look at the growth here in the second quarter, it's just a great validation for that very aggressive and simple approach that we take. And to give us now the confidence to expect for the full year some growth in a market that we previously did not expect, we're really pleased with that.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","The growth for the year, is it kind of a \u2013 it would be a continuation in the second half of these second quarter dynamics in terms of regional trends and your ability to continue to take share?","R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I don't know in the second half would it necessarily be the same regional trends. In all honesty, we don't necessarily even have specific forecasts by region in that way. But I wouldn't be surprised if it's a relatively similar continuation as we go into the second half.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking the questions. First question is a follow-up on the FCI margins. I think the original guidance was for FCI EBIT margins to be low-double digits. And if I try and back into what $0.03 of margin improvement implies, I think kind of gets you to a little over 200 bps of improvement, so maybe low-teens on average now for the year which, if you're getting better over the course of the year, should we be thinking that as you exit 2016 that FCI EBIT margins are something like 16%, maybe a little bit better?","R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think without going to a specific number, we're pleased that the operating performance is improving. And I think right now, it's maybe too early to say ultimately what the numbers will be. But you're correct in presuming that there is an improvement. And ultimately what that improvement will be by the end of the year still remains to be seen but we're just really excited about that improvement. And as I mentioned earlier, it's just an outstanding embrace of Amphenol at every level by the people of FCI that has ultimately resulted in them accelerating more than we had expected their operating performance improvement.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. And then a follow-up on OpEx, SG&A dollars. Should we be thinking about SG&A dollars declining on an absolute basis in September versus June?","Craig A. Lampo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I think normally from an SG&A perspective, certainly, we operate pretty efficiently and cost effectively from that perspective. SG&A is, I think, at a very effective rate for the sales. Our product development and technology expansion is very key in terms of how we spend our money from an SG&A perspective.","I think if you look at the second half of the year, I would expect that, as a percentage of sales, that our SG&A would certainly continue to decline as we get leverage on the increased sales. From an absolute dollar perspective, I don't necessarily know that that would essentially go down on higher volumes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks, Adam and Craig. I think you guys did a good job of explaining the puts and takes on sales for the full year guidance, but when we think about the EPS number, you guys raised the EPS guidance by about $0.02 at the midpoint. But you beat this quarter by $0.02 and you added about $0.03 from FCI. So, should we think about the FX impact and the macro stuff as being sort of a $0.02 to $0.03 hit to the full year and that's the offset to that, similar to revenue?","Craig A. Lampo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. Thanks. This is actually a good question. And I think your math actually is quite good in regard to that. FCI did add about $0.03, as I mentioned, and then we had the FX impact that Adam mentioned, which comes with it, a normal kind of a margin perspective and impacting us by about $0.02. And then you have essentially about \u2013 the difference essentially being the acquisition impact on the additional $40 million in the acquisitions that we did. A little bit lower profitability than the average of the company currently. So, that's why it brings a little bit less from an EPS accretion perspective.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And then, Adam, your IT and datacom segment is doing very well. It's 20% of revenue at this point, and typically Amphenol's strengths in their model has been that no segment is larger than 20%, that you're pretty well diversified. Would the strength expected to continue in IT and datacom? Is there some risks that this segment becomes too big, or do you need to offset that with more strength in another segment? Thanks.","R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, thank you very much, Sherri. I think if you look back over the years, it's true that today no segment represents more than 20% in the quarter. But we've had years where it's been a little bit more 20%, 25%. I think if you go back all the way to 2006, IT datacom was 25% of our sales. I think if you go back we had may be a year where Mil-Aero was a bit higher as a percent of sales.","So, it's not that 20% is the bright line. I think there is a level beyond which we wouldn't go, what is that? Is it 30%, is it something like \u2013 somewhere in that range probably makes us a little bit less comfortable. What's most important though is that we have that breadths and balance across all of our end markets. We think it is a tremendous asset for the company to have that diversification and balance, in addition to have it within the market.","And so, as we look at an IT datacom market, I mentioned earlier that the growth that we're seeing in that market is actually a lot driven by some of these newer customers and this sort of almost re-architecting of the nature of the market. And I think that's just the great credit to the interim market diversification that we have in IT datacom. But no, we're not putting the brakes on the IT datacom. It doesn't change our investment strategy. It doesn't change our appetite for acquisitions or otherwise, but we continue to be very sensitive that whatever we do strategically, we will maintain a good balance and we won't be over-relying on one or another of our markets for the company.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Suva from Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Unknown Speaker","Good afternoon. This is actually Mike (01:02:26) for Jim at Citi. Just one question, if I may. So we saw that the Cable business saw a nice operating margin improvement. So, do you believe that's something sustainable, or is it something even that can continue to improve going forward? Thank you.","Craig A. Lampo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, sure. Yeah, we are very pleased certainly with the growth and resulting profitability performance of the Cable segment. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, margin improved from 11.8% last year to $14.9%. I would say this three point increase -as again I mentioned in my prepared remarks reflects strong operating execution on this additional volume as the segment grew by about 11% related to the broadband market strength.","The team really also did really a nice job to diversify the business since it's really higher margin products and maintained really a strong pricing discipline. I should also note that there was also some favorable impacts from commodities.","I think if you look going into the second half of the year, Adam did mention that we expect that broadband market to moderate slightly into the second half. And as such, we would expect some moderation in the Cable segment profitability based on kind of normal conversions. But I would say based on the current commodity environment essentially \u2013 certainly if that doesn't change and demand environment doesn't change, then we would expect the profitability to be roughly in this range, flexing up and down based on whatever the volumes do.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Fox from Cross Research. Your line is now open.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Just one quick question from me on the cash flow. So, you're running well above the 1 times net income that you guys target; it's closer to 120%. So, is there anything unusual in the first half cash flows that would make us think that's not sustainable in the second half, or has something changed with your scale and operations that maybe even more cash flow efficient? Thanks.","Craig A. Lampo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. Actually the answer is \u2013 in regard to any unusual items in the quarter is, no, we had no real unusual items of note that would have increased our cash flow. This is the cash flow that we achieved in the first quarter. It's really a great cash flow. We've actually \u2013 it's not really abnormal. We've had similar cash flow as a percentage of net income probably for the last number of quarters, going back probably a couple of years at least. So, I would say that this is probably a cash flow generation that we would expect going forward as well from the company. We generated a strong cash flow for the business. The company does really a great job using its \u2013 managing its working capital and certainly in order to really maximize the cash flow they are able to generate to be able to invest back into the business and through M&A and other things to use our cash for.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Thanks.","R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian White from Drexel Hamilton. Your line is now open.","Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Yeah. Adam, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the dynamics you're seeing in the sensor markets, obviously a big opportunity, you made a couple of acquisitions in that area. So, maybe talk about your traction there and some of the dynamics and what you're seeing. Thank you.","R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thanks very much, Brian. Look, we remain very excited about the sensor market. We got into the market now more than two and a half years ago. Time really flies fast here, since we acquired first the Advanced Sensor business from GE. I can just tell you that the team has done an outstanding job in our sensor business. We are growing. We are improving the operating performance. We're expanding the range of opportunities in our pipeline. We are working in collaboration with the connector operations. I alluded to one of those areas where that's happening more intensively with places like hybrids and batteries. And we continue to be just very excited about the space.","In addition, we continue to hunt for acquisitions in the sensor market. We have an excellent pipeline. The market can still \u2013 really reminds us of a bit like the Interconnect market of a decade or two ago, a very fragmented market, lots of diversity from a technology perspective, from a customer and geographical perspective. And I can just tell you two thumbs up from our perspective in terms of the assessment two and half years in.","It is a space which is also not without challenges sometimes, I mean, you have competition, you have technology change, you have programs \u2013 that common programs that go very much like you have in the connector industry.","And I think our team and the culture of Amphenol, as it is now reflected in those companies that are in our sensor business, is just so much better equipped to deal with those dynamics than they may have been under their previous shareholders.","And I think of all the values that we have brought by those two acquisitions that we've made, so far, it is really incubating in them that agility and reactivity, the aggressiveness to shift towards where the opportunities are and not just hang your hat on something that may or may not be doing well. I mean, I look at our sensor business and we talked at the time when we first acquired it that we had some automotive business, we had some in heavy equipment, we had some in medical, where you can imagine, heavy equipment overall is a bit more of a challenging space.","The team has just done an amazing job of pivoting their technology efforts, pivoting their sales coverage and applications coverage towards where the opportunities are and doing that both on their own and in collaboration with others in Amphenol. So, we're really excited. We're still small in sensors. We are still on a relative from a market share of the overall broad market for sensors. We still have just a very small position, and that's also exciting because it gives me great confidence that we can expand long term both organically as well as through our robust acquisition program.","Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC","And Adam, just any color on wireless infrastructure in India.","R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Actually, Craig and I were in India recently. And we are just really pleased with how we've done in India. We've been in the mobile infrastructure in India. We're not new comers to that space. In fact, I think we've been from the greater part of a decade and a half participating in the Indian mobile infrastructure market, I mean, I personally have over the years spent a lot of time going to operators and OEMs in the Indian market. And I think that long-term patience and investment in the time, in the relationships and in the native creation of technology and great team that is there, that has positioned us really well in India. And we saw towards the tail half of last year, the beginnings of some good performance, and we have continued to see that this year. And our expectation is to have really \u2013 India be a good contributor to our mobile infrastructure business.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, speakers, I'm showing no further questions in queue.","R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Very good. Well thank you very much. And we truly appreciate everybody's attention today. And we wish that you all have a wonderful conclusion to the summer with hopefully a break between now and the next time that we see you for you and your families. Thanks again, and we'll talk to you in three months. Bye-bye.","Craig A.

[Operator Instructions] At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Ms. Diana Reardon. You may begin, ma'am.","Diana G. Reardon","Thank you. Good afternoon. My name is Diana Reardon, and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we'd like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter conference call. Q4 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question-and-answer session.","The company closed the fourth quarter, achieving sales of $949 million and EPS, excluding onetime items, of $0.73, beating the high end of the company's guidance. On an as-reported basis, EPS was $0.69 and included an $8.6 million or $0.03 charge relating to the impact of the previously reported flood and a charge of $2 million or $0.01 relating to acquisition transaction expenses for the acquisition of FEP closed in the quarter. ","Sales were flat in U.S. dollars and local currencies compared to Q4 of 2010. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and foreign exchange, sales in Q4 2011 were down 3% from last year. Sequentially, sales were down 8% in both U.S. dollars and organically from Q3. ","For the full year 2011, sales grew 11% over 2010. Breaking down sales into our 2 major components, our Cable business, which comprised 6% of our sales, was up 4% from last year and down 19% from last quarter. The Interconnect business, which comprised 94% of our sales, was flat with last year and down 7% sequentially. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. ","Operating income for the quarter, excluding onetime items, was $175 million compared to $191 million last year. Operating margin was 8.5%, a little better than our expectations, reflecting a negative conversion margin of approximately 28% from Q3 on an 8% sequential sales decline. The Q4 2011 ROS of 18.5% compared to a record Q4 2010 ROS of 20.1% and a Q3 2011 ROS of 19.3%. For the full year, ROS, excluding onetime items, is 19.2% compared to 19.7% for the full year 2010. ","The year-over-year margin reduction in Q4 of 1.6% is mainly attributable to lower margins in the Interconnect business, which were 20.8% in the quarter compared to 22.4% last year and 21.5% last quarter. In addition, stock option expense was higher in the quarter on flat sales, reducing overall ROS by 10 basis points or 0.1%. ","From an Interconnect margin standpoint, about 1\/3 of the reduction from last year relates to higher depreciation expense in the 2011 quarter compared to the 2010 quarter. While depreciation expense as a percentage of sales for the full year 2011 is comparable to 2010, the sequential decline in sales in Q4 2011 resulted in higher relative expense levels in the current quarter. ","The remaining reduction in margin reflects the impacts of increases in material input costs versus the prior year, particularly for precious metals and plastics and, to a lesser extent, cost in the quarter relating to workforce reductions of about 3%. These impacts were partially offset by the positive impacts of cost reduction actions and price increases. ","In the Cable business, margins improved to 13.1%, up from 12.3% last year. The margin improvement relates to higher volume of specialty cable products and lower relative material costs, primarily copper and aluminum. Overall, we're pleased with the company's operating margin performance of 18.5% in the fourth quarter and 19.2% for the full year 2011, excluding onetime items. The achievement of this profitably level in a year, where significant inflationary pressures on input costs coexisted with a volatile and less-than-supportive demand environment in many of our markets, is a hard-fought accomplishment by operating management. In response to that environment, from a headcount perspective for the year, we reduced headcount by about 4%, excluding the impact of acquisitions. We continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and culture of cost control will allow us to continue to react in a fast and flexible manner and achieve strong profitability. ","In addition, as we look forward to 2012, there are some signs from an input cost perspective, that the new year may bring a somewhat more balanced operating environment. In that more normal environment, the management team remains fully committed to margin expansion, as business volumes expand. Accordingly, the company's guidance for 2012 reflects the return of sequential quarterly operating income conversion rates in line with the company's long-term target of 25%. ","Interest expense for the quarter was $11.1 million compared to $10.2 million last year, reflecting higher average debt levels from the company's stock buyback program. Other income was $2 million in the quarter, up from $1.6 million last year, primarily as a result of higher interest income and higher levels of cash and short-term cash investments. In the fourth quarter, the company had an effective tax rate of 26.1% compared to a rate of 27.2% in last year's quarter. The 2011 quarter includes an aggregate tax benefit of approximately $3.3 million or 31% of the $10.6 million pretax onetime items described earlier. Excluding these effects, the effective tax rate in Q4 2011 was approximately 26.4%. For the full year 2011, excluding onetime items, the company's effective tax rate was 26.8%, and we currently expect the same tax rate in 2012. ","Net income, excluding onetime items, was approximately 12.8% of sales in Q4 and 13.3% for the full year, a very strong performance. Diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter was, on an as-reported basis, $0.69 compared to $0.74 last year. After adjustment for onetime items, diluted earnings per share was $0.73 in 2011 Q4 compared to $0.74 in the prior year quarter. For the full year, diluted earnings per share, excluding onetime items, grew 13% over 2010. ","Orders for the quarter were 989 million, up 4% from last year, resulting in a positive book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.04:1. As we announced last quarter, in early September, the company incurred damage at its Sidney, New York facility, as a result of a flood. In addition to the loss of approximately $18 million of sales and related margin from the temporary shutdown of the facility in September and October, of which $7 million related to October, the company incurred onetime charges relating to the write-off of damaged inventory and productive assets, in addition to cleanup costs net of insurance recoveries of about $12.8 million or $0.05 a share in the third quarter and $8.6 million or $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter. The company is in the process, with approximately $20 million of financial support from state and local authorities, of constructing a new facility in the local area outside of the flood zone to house the majority of the company's New York manufacturing activities. We expect this process to take about 18 to 24 months and require an investment by the company of approximately $15 million to $20 million over that same period. The company has full support of its customers for the move and does not anticipate any business disruption as a result. ","In late November, the company completed the acquisition of FEP, a German manufacturer of specialty molded interconnect products for the automotive market, with annual sales of about $120 million and excellent profitability, commensurate with its high-technology product offering. In addition, in conjunction with the acquisition, the company incurred costs for professional fees and transfer taxes of about $2 million or $0.01 a share, that under current accounting rules, are expense. The costs have been reflected as a separate line item in the income statement above operating income. ","The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash, and cash flow from operations is $169 million in the quarter, about 147% of net income for the quarter and 107% for the full year 2011. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. ","From a working capital standpoint, inventory increased about 2% over the September quarter and was up 18% from last year. Excluding acquisition impacts, inventory was about equal to the prior quarter. Inventory days, excluding acquisition impacts, increased to 89 days at the end of 2011, from 77 days at the end of 2010. About half of this increase on a year-over-year basis relates to higher raw material inventory, as the company continues to hold a higher level of raw material for certain commodities. In addition, in the fourth quarter, certain operations increased inventory levels in anticipation of an earlier Chinese New Year in 2012, in order to ensure appropriate levels of service to customers. ","From an inventory days perspective, the year-end inventory level is at the high end of the company's historic range, and we expect inventory days to decline in 2012. ","Accounts receivable was $767 million at the end of the year, down 4% from September and up 7% from the end of 2010. Days sales outstanding, excluding acquisition impact, increased to 71 days at the end of 2011, from 68 days at the end of 2010. Given the growth in the company's Asia business, we would expect the company's receivable days to remain approximately in this range in 2012. ","Cash flow from operations of $169 million, along with borrowings under the company's credit and receivables facilities of $112 million and $175 million of cash, were used primarily for $27 million of capital expenditures, $250 million relating to the acquisition of FEP, an increase of $43 million in cash investments and $138 million relating to the purchase of 3 million shares of company stock in the quarter. The company has approximately 6.6 million shares remaining under the 20 million share buyback program that expires in January of 2014.","As previously announced, in October, the company's board of directors approved an increase in the company's quarterly dividend to $0.105, beginning with the April dividend payment, increasing the yield to just under 1% at the time of the announcement. ","At the end of the year, our cash and short-term investments balance was $649 million, the majority of which is held outside of the U.S. Our debt stood at $1,377,000,000, bringing net debt to $728 million at the end of the year. We had availability under our revolving credit facilities of approximately $300 million, and the company's leverage and interest coverage ratios remained very strong at 1.4x and 22x, respectively. EBITDA in the quarter for the company was $223 million. ","From a financial perspective, this was a strong quarter. Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends.","R. Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much day, Diana, and I'd like to extend my personal welcome to all of you on the phone today and, as well, wish you all a happy New Year. I'm going to highlight first the fourth quarter and some of our achievements in the full year of 2011. Then I'd like to discuss the trends and progress in our various served markets. And then finally, I'll comment on our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2012, followed by a question-and-answer period. ","We're very pleased to report in the fourth quarter revenues and earnings above our guidance, despite significant uncertainties in the global economic environment. Revenues in the quarter were essentially flat to prior year and were down as expected from our record third quarter results. I am very proud, however, that our management team was able to secure strong profitability in the quarter, achieving industry-leading operating margins of 18.5%. The achievement of this level of profitability despite the uncertain economic environment and our reduced sales levels is a reflection of the strength and discipline of our agile organization and, most importantly, of our entrepreneurial management team. ","We're very encouraged that the company's financial strength has allowed us to continue our acquisition program in the fourth quarter. As Diana mentioned, we completed the acquisition of FEP, a German-based manufacturer of high technology interconnect products for the automotive market with annual sales of approximately $120 million. The FEP acquisition builds upon our fast-growing automotive Interconnect business, positioning us to further capitalize on the expansion of electronic content in automobile platforms around the world. It's also very consistent with our ongoing successful strategy to acquire complementary companies with strong management, leading technology and excellent market presence. As we welcome this excellent new team to Amphenol, we remain very confident that our successful acquisition program will continue to create value for Amphenol into the future. In addition, our confidence in the continued financial strength of the company is reflected in our ongoing stock buyback program, as well as the recently announced increase in our quarterly dividend. ","Now Diana mentioned the specifics relative to the Sidney flood. I'd just like to mention here that we are very proud of that team and their recovery efforts following the early September flood. The factory returned to full operational capacity early in the fourth quarter as a result of what are truly tremendous efforts of our entire Sidney organization, together with our vendors, as well as our distribution partners. And we look forward to a very strong future for this important business as we transition to our new facility in Sidney over the course of the next 18 to 24 months. ","Now turning to the full year of 2011. Despite the many challenges in the global economy this year, the company was able to achieve new records in sales and earnings per share in 2011. We produced sales of $3,940,000,000 and earnings per share of $3.05. And that, together with 19.2% operating margins and net income at 13.3% of sales, represented truly incredible achievements in that environment. We're especially pleased that we have continued to expand our market position, growing by nearly 11% in 2011, a level significantly above overall industry growth rates. The company's consistent focus on technology innovation and customer support through all phases of the economic cycle have resulted in Amphenol's strengthening our position across each of our end markets. In addition, our organization has accelerated the development of innovative interconnect technologies. These developments have allowed Amphenol to capitalize on exciting new areas of the ever-expanding electronics market, thereby broadening the opportunity for our future growth. Our drive to be the enabler of the electronics revolution has been very successful thus far and will be a great driver of our success going forward. ","In 2011, we have also continued our acquisition program, adding 2 new family members to Amphenol and creating excellent platforms for future expansion. As we closed the year, we find it very rewarding that the Amphenol organization has again built a new platform of strength, creating optimism for our future performance. ","Now I'd like to turn to the trends and the progress in our various served markets. And as expected in the fourth quarter, customers in many of our end markets reduced their levels of procurement in light of increased uncertainties in the global economy. Our sales to customers in the military and aerospace market represented 20% of total Amphenol in the quarter. Sales decreased 11% from prior year, on reductions in procurement by defense contractors related to budgetary uncertainties, as well as from the continued impacts from the Sidney flood. However, we are very pleased that sales did increase slightly from the third quarter. ","Sales into the commercial air market were very strong, increasing 15% from prior year and 6% sequentially on higher airplane production volumes, as well as the early phases of next generation jet liner production. We are optimistic that our sales into the commercial air market will strengthen further in 2012, as volumes continued to increase and as the ramp-ups of these new platforms accelerate. There no doubt remains uncertainty in the defense budgets of many developed economies, which may indeed moderate the growth opportunities in the military market to some degree in 2012. Nevertheless, we are confident that the increasing electronic content in military equipment, together with our broad program participation and our strong positions in high-growth emerging markets, will drive good growth into the future. We expect demand in both the military and commercial aerospace markets to strengthen in the first quarter, and we look forward to a strong long-term outlook for these important segments. ","The industrial market represented 13% of our sales into the quarter. Sales to customers in that market increased 3% from prior year and were at similar levels to the third quarter. We continue to make excellent progress in broadening our technology offering and increasing our penetration of the many exciting growth segments of the industrial market, including in particular, alternative energy, oil and gas, heavy equipment, as well as factory automation. While we experienced some expected slowing of demand, in particular in the European industrial market in the fourth quarter, we expect the overall industrial market to grow moderately in the first quarter, and we look forward to strong momentum for growth in 2012, as our new interconnect technologies continue to proliferate across a very diverse range of industrial applications. ","The automotive market represented 10% of total Amphenol in the quarter and sales increased a very strong 45% from prior year and 12% sequentially, as we benefited from an increase in both overall vehicle volumes, as well as new electronics applications and from the contributions of both the CEMM-THOME and FEP acquisitions, both completed this year. We're very excited by the significant expansion of our high-technology product offering, resulting from these acquisitions. In addition, we continue to invest in broadening our organic technology developments, leading to a growing presence on a diverse range of new automobile electronics. We expect demand in the automotive market to increase strongly in the first quarter to approximately 12% of total company sales, with the contribution of FEP, as well as our continued progress in new interconnect products for on-board electronics, as well as hybrid vehicles. ","Our sales into the broadband communication market represented 7% of total Amphenol this quarter. Sales moderated slightly from prior year and declined sequentially by 16% on more pronounced-than-expected seasonality. While recent pauses in raw material price depreciation have allowed us to achieve margins in the Cable business of 13.1%, pricing dynamics in the broadband market remained difficult. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by our increasing position with new Cable and Interconnect products, as well as by our strong position in international markets. We expect demand to improve seasonally in the first quarter, and we look forward to continuing to realize the further benefits of our diversification efforts. ","Our sales into the information technology and data communication market represented 20% of total this quarter. Sales in this market increased 3% from prior year with strength especially in storage and server applications and declined by 7% sequentially on an expected pause in procurement activity by customers in the IT market. Despite inventory corrections throughout the supply chain impacting our sales in the IT market in the fourth quarter, the pace of design activity with our strategic customers has actually accelerated. Our customers are pushing their data center equipment to new levels of performance in order to handle the rapid expansion of data, driven in particular by new mobile devices and the continuing spread of video on the Internet. While we expect demand to remain at these levels or slightly above in the first quarter, we are excited by our ongoing new program wins with these new advanced technologies, which creates strong potential for 2012 and beyond, as customers begin to release their next-generation platforms into the market. ","The mobile networks market represented 10% of total in the quarter, and sales in that market decreased 20% from prior year and 23% sequentially, as operators around the world slowed their build-outs and equipment makers reacted by sharply reducing their inventories and build rates. We expect demand to increase moderately in the first quarter, as production rates increase somewhat from these low levels and as operators begin to expand their network build-outs in order to relieve the pent-up demand for increased coverage and capacity, which exists on many networks. We look forward to further long-term strength driven by our broad design-in positions on new base station platforms, as well as our strong presence with the diverse range of global wireless operators. ","Sales to the mobile devices market represented 20% of total in the quarter and increased 5% from prior year, while decreasing 17% sequentially. As we had expected, some portion of our strong performance in the third quarter was related to a pull-ahead of demand by certain customers from the fourth quarter to the third quarter, thus, resulting in an unseasonal reduction in sales in the recent quarter. We anticipate some seasonal moderation of demand in the first quarter, and we expect overall growth in 2012 to moderate from these strong 2011 levels. Nevertheless, we are excited by our strengthening position in the rapidly expanding range of new, smart mobile devices, in particular, tablet computers and the potential that these create in 2012 and beyond. Our comprehensive portfolio of products for mobile devices, as well as our preferred supplier relationships with all major device makers, continue to position us strongly in this important end market. ","I am extremely proud of the Amphenol organization in 2011, as we have executed well in what can only be termed a very, very difficult market environment. Our successful navigation through the many challenges of the fourth quarter and, indeed, of the entire year of 2011, confirms once again the resiliency and strength of the Amphenol organization. The company's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers and diverse markets, our worldwide presence, our lean and flexible cost structure and, most importantly, an agile and entrepreneurial management team. ","Now looking forward into 2012 and based on constant exchange rates, as well as normal seasonal patterns, we now expect in the first quarter and the full year for 2012 the following results. We expect sales in the range of $960 million to $975 million for the first quarter and $4,050,000,000 to $4,150,000,000, respectively, in the full year. We expect EPS in the range of $0.73 to $0.76 for the first quarter and $3.23 to $3.34 for the full year. For the full year, this guidance represents sales and earnings per share growth of 3% to 5% and 6% to 10%, respectively. ","We're very encouraged by the strong outlook in sales and earnings, especially given the many ongoing uncertainties in the global economy. And I remain extremely confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon our new record levels of revenues and EPS established in 2011 and to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position and to expand our profitability into 2012 and beyond. ","Thank you very much. And at this time, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that may be there.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just wanted to ask a little bit about the long-term guidance for fiscal '12. If I look at the revenue guidance, it's a couple of points, maybe 3% or 4% growth. But if we strip out the FEP acquisition, it actually looks flat. So I just wanted to get a sense, you talked about a number of big opportunities in some of your different segments. Why would your expectations be for relatively flat revenue growth? Is that based on forecast from customers? Or just a little detail there.","R. Adam Norwitt","I mean, if you look at the guidance, in fact, at the high end of guidance, we would be growing organically, I think, somewhere around 3%. And in the current environment, we actually think that is a very strong and prudent guidance at the same time. I mean, we continue to see opportunities across all of our markets, but there continues, as well, to be just tremendous uncertainty in the world economy. As we sit here on January 18, 2012, and give guidance forward for the next 12 months, we think it's important to be prudent in that and recognizing that there have been, over the last 12 months, many political, economic and other uncertainties, and I wouldn't say that we're at the end of the rope on all of those things. But given that environment, given as well the -- where we are coming from in the fourth quarter, this is really extremely strong guidance.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So a little bit of conservatism baked in there, it sounds like. And then just looking at the SG&A. The SG&A number came down in the fourth quarter a little bit. Diana, what type of SG&A should we expect as we move through fiscal '12 and, specifically for the first quarter, after you've done all this headcount reduction? Should it be down from where we are in the fourth quarter? Or is it going to be relatively flat?","Diana G. Reardon","Yes. Sure. I mean, I wouldn't expect it to come down. I think that we certainly have a very disciplined approach to SG&A spending and are able to flex it some with demand. But, I think, looking into 2012, an assumption that says that SG&A would probably grow about half the rate of sales would probably be the right assumption.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Jim Suva with Citi.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I have 2 questions. First of all, the company you acquired, can you help us kind of gauge -- does it need a lot of restructuring? Are the operating margins on par with Amphenol? A lot of movement you have to do around that, or is it kind of you acquiring it and just integrating it and it's already fully rolled out? Then the second question is regarding your M&A strategy. It looks like the last few M&As have been on the auto side. Does that now fill your portfolio gap on auto, or given the content growth, is that an area that you're still a lot more optimistic for, where we could expect to see some more integration there?","R. Adam Norwitt","First, relative to FEP. I mean, this is not a company that requires any restructuring. So we are not at all doing that. We have acquired a management team that has just tremendous, tremendous experience and capability and vision for the future, and we're very, very proud to welcome that management team to Amphenol. And we are not -- we have not deposited any Amphenol employees in the building. They are running that company so successfully, the day after closing like they were the day before. Relative to the profitability of the company, I think, Diana mentioned, I mean, this is a very, very strong, profitable company, well above their peers in the industry that they participate in and would compare very favorably across any of the markets that we participate in. So we're very, very pleased with that. It is a real confirmation that there is money to be made in every market when you have technology to offer to your customers. And that has been something that we have always talked about, that, if you can create value for your customers, by embedding that value in the interconnect products that you sell, which allow your customer to, in the end, have greater value to sell to their customers, there's money to be made and you can achieve superior margins and profitability in such an environment. We're very happy that FEP has that same mindset, as we have always had. And that's why the marriage with them will be, I believe, very, very successful. Now, you are correct. We have made some acquisitions over the course of the last year, year and half in the automotive market. And I think that is just an indication that, that is a market where there has been a real acceleration in terms of the proliferation of new electronics application, that now, we believe, have value and where Amphenol should participate. If I can just remind you, from where we have come in terms of our automotive business, going all the way back to when we were making, really, safety devices and on-board telematics, RF-type products that go into the car, we have really broadened that offering today, as the electronics have broadened across the car. So I would not tell you that we would not do anymore acquisitions in automotive, but we will certainly do acquisitions in all of the markets as they become available and as we work them through our pipeline. But we're very excited. I mentioned that automotive will be about 12% of sales in the first quarter. It's been a very strong growing market for us this year, and we expect good things from that market going forward.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Craig Hettenbach with Goldman Sachs.","Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Adam, just a follow-up on the comments on the mobile device market. The comment of moderation in growth for 2012, do you view that as specific to the market or are you being more selective in that end market?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes. I mean, first, let's just recognize that, that is a market where we grew this year more than 30% year-over-year. And we have had just fabulous growth in that market. So we would not certainly expect to grow anywhere near those levels this year. I mean, that is just outstanding growth. We are participating in that market on a broad basis. But I should also say that the smart devices, the tablet computers, these kinds of devices, this is where the content and the opportunity for value is. And we continue to drive our engineering resources towards attacking those areas of the smart mobile device market and the overall mobile device market, where we can create value for our customers. What will the overall market grow in this year? You would know as well as I what the forecast would be. But we clearly would not expect to have that kind of big uptick that we had, part of which was due to the sort of new advent of tablet computers, where we had never participated before, laptops, and the things that those tablets have been replacing. But we look forward to that market, and we look forward to being a very strong participant in that market going forward.","Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And if I could follow up with Diana. Any other comments on the commodity costs in terms of potential impact and in the quarter just completed and as you go through the year, what the impact could be?","Diana G. Reardon","Yes. I mean, I think as you know, we don't call out specific impact of individual commodities. But I think, as I said in the prepared remarks, we're talking about margin, what our expectations are in 2012. I think, we have seen some indication that there seems to be a stabilization in some commodities and better trends in others. And I think that, being combined with what we call a more normal demand environment as we look into Q1 and then into 2012, I think will provide a more normal balance between pricing opportunity in the market, volume growth and also the input cost side, that we feel will allow us to return to our historical norm of being able to achieve these 25% conversion margins. And I think, as I mentioned, from a sequential standpoint in 2012, our guidance does reflect that. So I would say that, if the environment stays as it is today, we'd certainly feel more optimistic about sequential margin expansion.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research.","Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC","Two questions, Adam. First of all, your comment about design activity accelerating in the IT and datacom space. Was that -- can you just expand on that? Was that mainly a market comment? Or is there more Amphenol-specific stuff going on that you could elaborate on? And then secondly, with regard to the FEP acquisition. Looking at the molding technologies that you're acquiring, is this more complementary to what you're doing? Like, how does it integrate or get you more print position in automobile?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes. These are fine questions. Relative to my comment on IT datacom, I don't know whether that is a market or an Amphenol, but what I can tell you is that our engineers are extraordinarily busy over the whole year, but that seems to even accelerate going into the end of the year, whereby, we see our equipment maker customers focusing on creating core equipment that can manage the data traffic that people are really struggling with today. And I think this has been kind of a slow-motion tidal wave here, this data. I mean, people know it is coming. They see it coming, but it takes some time to spool up that equipment to these next-generation levels. And we see that, really, on a worldwide basis, when we're working with IT customers, in all geographies, new entrants to the market, the existing leaders to the market. There is a real race to get to these high speeds. And as you go down that path towards high speed, the challenges, the implications for the interconnect products are so much more significant and challenging to deal with. And so our engineers have just a much, much more intensive interaction with these customers, to help them solve all of the sort of inherent issues that are around those new high-speed systems. And I think, as we look forward, that's obviously going to result in new platforms, where we will participate, and which can create new bases of growth for the future. There's no doubt about it, the IT infrastructure at companies, at universities, in the financial services, wherever that is, there is going to have to be a constant upgrade to deal with that flood of data that is there. Now, relative to FEP, it's very astute to see that this is a company that, in particular, has an outstanding strength in molding technology. No doubt about it. This is a very complementary acquisition to Amphenol. We have already a growing product line of value-add and component level products that go into the automotive market, and we look forward to the team at FEP, both from a customer innovator standpoint, but also from a technology innovation standpoint, to be just tremendous participants, as we seek to continue that high growth that we've achieved so far in the automotive market.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","First question, just regarding the distribution channel. I know you've seen an inventory correction like other suppliers, and I know that's not a big percentage of your revenue, and I also know that distribution plays a big role in your Military business. So can you talk about order trends there? And have you seen any inventory replenishment from distribution as a result of the Sidney plant and the fact that distribution basically chipped in to help fill those orders?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes. No. I mean, as you correctly pointed out, distribution is not as significant for us. It represents something around 14% of our total sales. For Military, it is more significant. We have not seen any meaningful kind of replenishment as you would put it. And the channel was very, very supportive during the flood, and that was one of the reasons why we were able to satisfy, essentially, every customer during that time period, which is not something that is easy to do, let me tell you. Because the customers, they still got to build their end systems, and there was, certainly, some damage to parts and to machines. And so the strength of the channel has helped. We have not seen the replenishment in any significant fashion. Would we expect to see that going forward? I think it really depends on the macro environment. Because I believe that the distribution channel, more than most, is very responsive to that macro environment. If they don't feel good about it, then they're not going to replenish it. If they start to feel incrementally better, maybe they will start to put some more parts on the shelf. We have not seen so far, though, any significant or meaningful distribution comeback.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then on the telecom infrastructure, where you talked about incremental weakness in the quarter. It sounds like it may be a little bit better. But was that broad-based or specific to any region? And are you getting a sense or do you have a sense that it could ramp through the end of the year based on pent-up demand?","R. Adam Norwitt","No. I think we see it from 2 sides. We see it first from the operator side, where we work directly with many significant operators around the world with our installation products, our antennas. And there is one where, I would tell you that, that has been a very difficult finish of the year, the spending was very much clamped down upon for whatever reason. I mean, there is all these other mergers and whatnot that have happened in various regions. But I think we have started to see a little bit of a pickup, at least a bottoming, I would say, in terms of the operator activity. Relative to the equipment makers, it's a little bit more difficult to read because they all had their customers reducing demand. They had a certain expectation going into the fourth quarter in terms of where they -- what inventory levels and how they had ramped up their supply chains, whether they have indeed worked through all of that inventory that they had built up in anticipation of the fourth quarter. That, I have a hard time to say. We don't have peer visibility into the contract manufacturers and the OEMs and their respective warehouses. That being said, as I mentioned, we do expect in the first quarter for Amphenol in that market to sequentially perform stronger than we had off of these low levels. And I certainly would hope and would expect to some extent that over the course of the year, that there would be more of a return to normalcy. No doubt that the capacity, the coverage that exists in the wireless market gets worse and worse every single day. And so the customers, the end customers, you and me, and all the rest on the phone here, we are at one point going to get up and revolt here if they don't have better coverage. And I think the operators understand that. They have to really ramp up their build-outs, and that's true around the world, in all the geographies. And we look forward to participating, and we're well positioned to participate as the build-outs happen.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Mike Wood with Macquarie.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","My question is another way to look at your outlook. If you look at your growth in various submarkets compared to your order trends, do you think that you're currently seeing the content growth that you've talked about in aerospace, military, auto, smart mobile devices? And is that included in your outlook? Or do you think there might be a pause in that content growth?","R. Adam Norwitt","No. I would say that we certainly continue to see that content growth. I mean, if you look in the fourth quarter, take 2 of the markets that you mentioned here, mil aero, as well as commercial air, we were sequentially, essentially, on or slightly above the third quarter in that kind of macro environment, that is clearly not sequentially flat. So I believe that is representative very much of content growth. We see that, in particular, in commercial aero, but we also see that in the defense markets. Relative to the mobile phone market, we grew year-over-year in sort of mid-single digits. We had a year-to-date -- full year performance in that market, growing more than 30%. I don't think that whole market grew 30%. So the content growth that we have seen there has clearly been strong. Do we accelerate that content growth? Do we continue to enjoy the platforms that we've designed in going forward? Clearly, we will continue to enjoy that. We have achieved a lot so far this year, and we'll continue to bear the fruits from that. I think, as we look forward into the first quarter, and we talked about in our guidance that the mil aero market, we expect to go up sequentially. Again, I think that is indicative of expansion of our content across a market that is not necessarily growing at that pace.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Steve O'Brien with JPMorgan.","Steven J O'Brien - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Adam, can you touch on some of the regional differences in demand, perhaps, and any concerns you're baking in regarding Europe in terms of the full year guidance? I mean, is there assumption that sort of with low-single digit organic growth that some regions will be stronger and others weaker?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes. I mean, just relative to the results that we have just reported, I can tell you, not surprisingly, in the fourth quarter, with our automotive business being as strong as it was and with our mobile business being as strong as it was, Europe was a strong performer, and Asia was a strong performer on a year-over-year basis. I mean, European sales grew very strongly with the automotive progress that we've made. Sequentially, the whole company was down, and I'd say all the markets were down. Maybe Europe was down less than the others, again, because of that automotive strength. As we look forward, I mentioned that the industrial market in particular was one where we had seen some weakening in the European industrial market, and we would not expect that necessarily to get much worse, but I wouldn't say that we have necessarily very high expectations for growth in that part of the market. Overall, we are not factoring in some macroeconomic cataclysm. I mean, neither Diana nor I are macroeconomists here. We listen to what our customers say. We do a bottoms-up forecasting based on what we interact with our customers and what we hear, and that's really how -- what results in the guidance. We're not, sort of, reading the tea leaves relative to whether some country or other will default on their debt. If that happens, we'll deal with it. I mean, clearly, the fourth quarter was a quarter that was impacted by macro events around the world. As we mentioned at our last call, if you had asked me at the beginning of the third quarter, what would the fourth quarter be, I certainly would not have told you, it will be down 8% sequentially. And there were a lot of sort of governmental macro, political, economic issues that came about. I don't know that those have necessarily fully resolved themselves. But clearly, it seems that we're in a somewhat more stable environment today.","Steven J O'Brien - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you. And then, if I could, on the mobile devices side. I mean, looking at the guidance for the first quarter, year-over-year basis, if I have my numbers right, it certainly won't be growing. I would think that even the most pessimist assumptions for smartphones, tablets, ultrabooks, et cetera, still look pretty strong for 2012. I mean, do you expect a potential for accelerating growth, noting that Q2 and Q3 were very strong last year, but maybe as we exit 2012, Amphenol will kind of normalize to the pace of growth in those markets?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes. Look, I mean, whether we normalize to the pace of growth in the markets, I think, our goal in all of our markets has always been to outperform the markets that we participate in, and I think we've done a pretty good job of achieving that in this market in particular, as well as in the other markets. Relative to what will happen in the first quarter, we work with lots of customers across that market. And there are programs that go up. There are programs that go down. And that is part of the reason why we have been successful in many ways. We have expanded our position, for example, on tablet computers, in particular, in 2011. Going into the first quarter, I wouldn't tell you that there's any individual thing that is happening different. We're just folding up the forecast that we have from our customers, which are reflective of what would normally be a seasonality into that quarter. Relative to the year-over-year performance, again, there are platforms that come and go. We are putting tremendous focus on putting our products where there is value for Amphenol. And there may be, occasionally, some products where we say, we don't want to even participate in that. We want to be in the products where we can generate the returns for the company that we have become accustomed to and that we really demand when we participate in a market, and we feel that, that will be the most successful thing for us to run that business.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Adam, my first question for you was just around bookings. You had a very strong book-to-bill in the quarter, 1.04. I apologize if you covered this. I was just curious if you can give us some insight in terms of where you think the relative strength came from. And also just linearity in terms of orders, was there any sort of an acceleration in order trends towards the back end of the quarter?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes. Just relative to the linearity, actually, it was pretty linear throughout the quarter in terms of orders. So I wouldn't tell you that there was any kind of spike that came at the end or at the beginning. I mean, normally, you would have, in the fourth quarter, a pretty strong October. I would tell you that in this quarter it was actually pretty linear in terms of both sales and orders across the quarter. We feel very good about those bookings that we had, and not all bookings can be shipped within 30, 60, 90 days. But it is a clear reflection across all the markets that we serve in that we believe our customers are growing in confidence enough to give us the bookings that can then support the strong guidance that we've given for the full year. So we feel very good about the bookings and look forward, hopefully, to booking more here in the first quarter.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Was the booking strength, I guess, what I was trying to ask, was it sort of broad-based across all your end markets, was it specific end markets that...","R. Adam Norwitt","No. It was broad-based. I think I alluded to that. I mean, there are some of our markets that have a very quick turn, where the bookings are more in line with the revenues, things like mobile devices, where you're not booking on long lead times. But of the other markets, which have more normal booking schedules, this was quite broad-based.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then just as a follow-up, philosophically, with respect to M&A, is your preference to gravitate towards deals like FEP, companies that are very technologically robust and easily integrated in your large organization, or would you also be open to doing larger deals that might require some heavy restructuring and heavy lifting, as long as you can get them at attractive prices?","R. Adam Norwitt","Well, look, we have a very clear philosophy about acquisitions. Number one, we look for a company that has good people; number 2, a company that has great technology; and number 3, that has a complementary market position. In general, that has led us towards companies that have some of those 3 characteristics, and FEP has really all of them in spades. Does that mean that we confine ourselves in our acquisition strategy towards only very focused companies of a certain size? Absolutely not. To the extent that we find companies that satisfy those criteria and maybe even operate at a level of profitability below where we are today, we would certainly pursue those. And that is, really, regardless of size. What we're not going to do though is just buy something because it's cheap and it's big. So, I mean, we're going to continue to have an acquisition strategy that focuses on paying fair value for companies that have tremendous potential value to Amphenol in the future.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Will Stein with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","William Stein - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A few quick ones. I don't think, historically, you've disclosed bookings. So maybe you can frame for us a little bit how the 1.04 book-to-bill compares on a seasonal basis to a typical Q4. Is this a particularly strong bookings quarter from your perspective?","Diana G. Reardon","For a Q4, this would be a stronger-than-normal quarter. I think, on average, if we would go back in time, I would think that a Q4 would more -- normally, would be kind of a 1:1 book-to-bill ratio.","William Stein - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Very helpful. Second, ultrabooks. I assume that you're active in design wins in that product. It looks like it's going to be kind of one of the more popular products this year in terms of development and eventual sales. First, can you confirm that, that's a category that you're interested in? And then also maybe talk or remind us, which end market you would tend to disclose this in.","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes. In fact, ultrabooks, what those end up being and what our participation will be, will really depend on the nature of the product. I mean, we have not participated so broadly in laptops in the past, only because the interconnect solutions that are embedded in those products have been relatively off the shelf, non-real high-value products. And so we have really steered away from those over the years. Whether ultrabooks, to some extent, have more kind of value embedded in them relative to the interconnect, I think that remains to be seen. I mean, we participate with some of them to some extent, but I wouldn't say necessarily, unless there is a real shift in the total architecture of those ultrabooks that, that would necessarily be a huge thing. Take a tablet, is a very different thing. You're compressing in a tablet a tremendous amount of functionality, tremendous amount of data, wireless connectivity, very, very compact interconnect solutions. That suite of opportunities for Amphenol has created great opportunities for us to make a product for our customer that allows enough value to be made where it's interesting for us to participate. I think the jury is still out on whether that will be so much in ultrabooks. Where we are disclosing that in a market segment, I don't even know that, that's such a significant segment for us, to that extent. If it is more like a tablet, we disclose that in mobile devices. If it looked more like a computer, that would probably be in IT.","William Stein - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And one other quick one if I can. On FEP, historically, you've had earn-out provisions in your transactions. Is it fair to think of this as similar to your prior methodology for structuring deals?","Diana G. Reardon","In this particular deal, we don't -- there's no earn-out structure.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. One, maybe just on the industrial side. I think you guys talked about flat trends in December, some growth in the first half. It's better than the concern I think people had. I\u2019m just curious, is your sense of the inventory correction in that space is behind us? Or is the positive commentary more a reflection of some new wins you've had? Any help there would be useful.","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes. I mean, relative to industrial, I think, we have had a very, very strong year in industrial, Amit. I mean, we grew, essentially, for the full year by 17% in the industrial market. I think we have made just tremendous, tremendous progress in broadening our portfolio of technologies across that market. Going into all these new subsegments of the market and so, from that perspective, I would probably say that our performance is a little bit more that we have broadened our position rather than just the tide going up and down in industrial. I mean, we are really hitched to some of the very high growth opportunities in the industrial market, things like oil and gas, things like solar, high-speed rail, markets in China and India, places like that, where there is a lot of industrial activity ongoing. I did mention before that we have seen in Europe, in particular, some moderation of the growth there and, hopefully, even some bottoming out of that performance in Europe. Looking forward, relative to inventories, I wouldn't really credit our performance in the quarter to a rebuilding of inventories. And how those inventories will proceed going forward, that is actually less of a concern to us than are we getting the positions with these new customers and these new applications with the new products that we're developing.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And then 2 quick follow-ups maybe. One on the full year guide of 3% to 5% growth, if I just look at the FX at this point, it looks like it will be 150 basis headwind for you guys in 2012. Is that roughly what you're encapsulating in your guidance as well?","Diana G. Reardon","Yes. I think the organic is about -- is 3% at the high end, Amit. So there's about a 2% net between the acquisition impact and the foreign exchange impact.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then just finally, the $257 million, I think, that cash paid for acquisitions, is that also the FEP transaction? Or were there some past payouts in that number as well?","Diana G. Reardon","No. This was for the FEP acquisition.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","First question has to deal with the Broadband Cable business, 13.1% EBIT margin this quarter. Would you expect that to be the peak as we move into 2012? Or do you think you can see some upside in profitability as volumes ramp, given the commentary regarding the pricing environment?","Diana G. Reardon","Yes. We would hope, I mean, that we could see some further upside as volumes ramp, depending on what commodities do from here. But I think, in general, we've seen a positive impact on cost in the fourth quarter. We would expect to see some further positive impact in Q1. And if we get some volume along with that, I think we should be able to see some movement in margins up above that 13.1% we achieved in the fourth quarter.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then my follow-up has to deal with the military defense market, growing nicely in aerospace. But looking at the 2012 guidance, what type of, I guess, sales decline would you expect out of the military market, given the trends you experienced in the back half of the year?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes. I mean, actually, I wouldn't tell you that we would necessarily anticipate a sales decline for the full year of 2012. I think we expect that market to be moderate in the context. But certainly, we would not anticipate a sales decline. I mean, clearly, we had this year some lost sales from the flood. We hope to make up a good portion of that throughout the course of the year. And those efforts that we have had ongoing to offset the budgetary issues with the expansion of electronic content and, really, a repositioning of resources towards the areas where money is still being spent in the military. And there are clearly still areas being spent in the military. I mean, even with the recent -- the President going to the Pentagon and talking about all the things that are going on, without much specificity, I should say, there are still tremendous opportunities that our teams see. And our teams are not working at the kind of Washington level. They are working in the labs. They are working with the program managers, where there are continually programs that are being developed, new programs, existing programs, foreign military sales, which is becoming an increasing priority with many of our customers today. And so we see still the opportunity for growth in that market. And relative to commercial air, that is the market where we see, obviously, stronger growth potential going into this year, as those new platforms, really, \"take off,\" so to speak. And I think that there's going to be great opportunities, really, in that market and long term for both of those markets.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Tony Kure with KeyBanc.","Anthony C. Kure - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. Just had a quick question regarding the acquisition. Would it be fair to read into the fact that the acquisition, this most recent one, the German company, is maybe a result of the uncertain macro environment there, where potential acquisition targets maybe in the region are more open to discussions with you, given the uncertainty of their own environment?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes. I wouldn't necessarily read that into it. I mean, every acquisition has a certain ownership, which has a certain time frame to sell. I think, in this case, the ownership of the company had made a decision long before Greece and all of these things, that they had a certain schedule, and that was the schedule they were going to live to. So I would not at all read anything into that. They're selling when the sky is falling.","Anthony C. Kure - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a little clarification on the $18 million or so of lost sales. First, was that all military? And then second, do you expect to get that more weighted in the first half or the second half of 2012?","Diana G. Reardon","It's primarily in the defense market, a small amount in the commercial air market. And we would expect to recover that during the year, whether it's in one specific quarter or the first half or second half of the year, I couldn't really say. But I think by the end of the year, we expect to have those sales fully recovered.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Adam, on the FEP acquisition, can you share geographically where the revenue exposure is for FEP? It sounds like it's largely Europe. And given the high tech content, is it overexposed to any particular segments of the auto market? And I have a follow-up for Diana.","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure. No, it's a nice question. Obviously, they are based in Europe, and they have a predominance of their business in Europe. But they have also a growing business in Asia, in part, with European OEMs. Relative to the technology and the platforms that they participate on, they are a very broad supplier into a broad range of platforms, ranging from low-end, high-volume cars, all the way to the highest luxury vehicles.","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And, Diana, I know you don't roll off raw material costs, but it sounded from your prepared commentary that there's an implicit assumption that raw material costs don't necessarily move, maybe they move in tandem with demand to get to that 25% incremental margins, which has been your historical performance. Is that the right way to think about it? Or are the headcount reductions been such that you can absorb more volatility around raw materials at this point and still get to those conversion margins?","Diana G. Reardon","No. I think your first statement is exactly the right way to think about it. I mean, we've seen some improvement in most of the commodities, but we've also seen -- we see as we go into 2012, I think, also some improvement in the demand environment. And it's really that balance -- well, it was out of balance in 2011 that caused most of the difficulty from a margin perspective. And so we do feel that based on those 2 facts, we see more of a balanced environment in 2012, and we do believe that we should be able to, therefore, expand margins.","Operator","At this time, I have no additional questions in the queue.","R. Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you all very much. And, again, we appreciate your time and your interest in the company, and once again, wish you a happy New Year and a successful beginning to 2012. Goodbye.","Operator","Thank you for attending today's conference, and have a nice day."],"2236":["Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) Q4 2015 Earnings Conference Call January 20, 2016  1:00 PM ET","Executives","Adam Norwitt - Chief Executive Officer","Craig Lampo - Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Matt Sheerin - Stifel","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Mike Wood - Macquarie","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research","Will Stein - SunTrust","Jim Suva - Citi","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs","Operator","Hello and welcome to the Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation.

For the full year 2015, sales grew 4% in U.S. dollars, 8% in local currencies and 3% organically compared to 2014.","Breaking down sales into our two segments, our Cable business, which comprised 6% of our sales, was down 4% from last year primarily due to the effect of currency translations. The interconnect business, which comprised 94% of our sales, was up 1% from last year, reflecting the benefits of both organic growth and the company\u2019s acquisition program partially offset by currency translation. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.","Operating income increased to $289 million in the fourth quarter. Operating margin, excluding one-time items, was a strong 20.2% equal to both the fourth quarter of 2014 as well as the third quarter of 2015. On an as-reported basis, operating margins were 19.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014.","From a segment standpoint, in the Cable segment, margins were 12.5% compared to 12.1% last year. The increase in margins related primarily to strong operating execution and some favorable impact from commodities. In the interconnect segment, margins were 22.4%, which is consistent with last year on similar sales levels. We are very pleased with the company\u2019s operating margin achievement. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company\u2019s entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster high-performance, action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment. Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance.","Interest expense for the quarter was $17 million compared to $20 million last year, reflecting the benefit of a lower average effective interest rate in the current quarter more than offsetting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the company\u2019s acquisition and stock buyback programs. The lower average rate is primarily a result of the implementation of a new commercial paper program.","Other income was $4 million in the fourth quarter of \u201815 compared to $5 million last year and consists primarily of interest income on cash and short-term cash investments. The company\u2019s effective tax rate was 26.5% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 26.4% in the fourth quarter of \u201814, excluding one-time items. On an as-reported basis, the company\u2019s effective tax rate was 26.2% in the fourth quarter of \u201814.","Net income was a very strong 14% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2015 and EPS was $0.63 equal to the fourth quarter of 2014, excluding one-time items. For the full year 2015, EPS, excluding one-time items, was $2.43, up 8% over 2014, an excellent performance considering the current market environment. Orders for the quarter were $1.463 billion, a 2% increase over the fourth quarter of 2014, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02 to 1.","The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was a record $322 million in the fourth quarter or approximately 159% of net income. For the full year, operating cash flow was $1.030 billion or 133% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $852 million at the end of December, down 4% from September.","Inventory days were 79 days, down 1 day compared to September. Accounts receivable was approximately $1.1 billion at the end of December, down approximately 5% from September. Days sales outstanding was 71 days consistent with September levels. Accounts payable was $588 million at the end of December, down approximately 11% from September levels. Payable days were 54 days, down 6 days compared to September levels and still within our normal range.","The cash flow from operations of $322 million, along with stock option proceeds of $25 million, were used primarily to reduce debt by approximately $27 million, to purchase approximately 53 million of the company\u2019s stock, to fund net capital expenditures of $39 million, to fund dividend payments of $43 million, which resulted in an increase of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $162 million net of translation.","During the quarter, the company repurchased 1 million shares under its January 2015 10 million share stock repurchase program. 5.5 million shares remain available under the program through January 2017. At December 31, cash and short-term investments were $1.8 billion, the majority of which is held outside the U.S. The company used just under $1.2 billion of its cash and short-term investments net of cash acquired to fund the previously announced FCI acquisition on January 8. We are very pleased to have been able to fund the entire acquisition with cash on hand.","Total debt at December 31 was $2.8 billion and net debt was approximately $1 billion. After funding the acquisition of FCI, net debt is approximately $2.2 billion. At quarter end, the company had issued $824 million under its $1.5 billion commercial paper program and Q4 2015 EBITDA was approximately $343 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance.","Before I turn the call over to Adam, I wanted to just make a couple of comments relative to our guidance. As previously noted, we completed the acquisition of FCI on January 8, and consequently, the results of FCI will be included in the consolidated company results effective as of that date and therefore are incorporated in our guidance. For the full year 2016, we expect that the FCI acquisition will generate approximately $0.12 of accretion on sales of approximately $570 million. I would also note that while the acquisition is accretive to EPS, the inclusion of FCI in the company\u2019s consolidated results will reduce our operating income margin by approximately 90 to 100 basis points as FCI currently operates at a low double-digit operating income level.","As we have previously stated, the management team is fully committed to improving FCI margins up to the average of the company over time. From a sales perspective, our guidance reflects an organic growth rate, excluding all acquisitions and currency impacts, of down 6% to down 3% in the first quarter of \u201816 and down 1% to up 2% for the full year of 2016. In addition, our guidance excludes any one-time charges associated with the FCI acquisition related to external acquisition transaction costs or other one-time acquisition related costs such as amortization of backlog or any one-time costs associated with improvements in cost structure.","Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends.","Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much, Craig and it\u2019s my pleasure to also welcome all of you to our call here and I hope it\u2019s certainly not too late to wish each of you a Happy New Year. As Craig mentioned, I am going to highlight a little bit our fourth quarter and as well as reflect back on our full year achievements in 2015. I will then spend some time to discuss the trends and our progress in our served markets. And then finally, I will make a few comments on our outlook for the first quarter and the full year and of course we will have time at the end for questions.","With respect to the fourth quarter, certainly our results in this quarter were stronger than expected as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and earnings, despite what is clearly a heightened level of market uncertainty. Although we had expected some decline from prior year, our revenues ultimately were flat in U.S. dollars and increased by 3% in local currencies, reaching that level of $1.431 billion. I think Craig mentioned as well that the company booked a record $1.463 billion in orders, which represented a book to bill of 1.02 to 1. We are especially proud that in the quarter, we equaled our highest levels of profitability in the company\u2019s history as we sustained our industry leading operating margins at the same 20.2% that we achieved in the third quarter. In fact, over the last five quarters, three of those quarters we have achieved that 20.2%.","Operating cash flow was another real highlight in the quarter as we reached a new record of $322 million of operating cash flow and actually free cash flow of $281 million. These are really just great confirmations of the company\u2019s discipline and financial strength. I am extremely proud of this Amphenol organization. Our results this quarter confirm once again the true value of our entrepreneurial culture as we once again exercised both the agility and the discipline necessary to perform well despite what are clearly significant and mounting uncertainties across the worldwide economy.","Craig mentioned that we closed the FCI acquisition in \u2013 just here recently in January. And we are extremely excited to have completed that acquisition on January 8, after we finally received the last antitrust approval, which was from China at the end of December. FCI is the largest acquisition in the history of the company. It represents a significant expansion of our interconnect product offerings for customers in the IT datacom, industrial, mobile infrastructure, automotive and mobile devices markets. But most importantly, we have added a truly outstanding group of talented individuals to our organization. In fact just last week, we hosted a large group of the FCI management team here at our headquarters in Wallingford and what I can only confirm for you is that they are all truly excited to be part of the Amphenol organization.","Looking into 2016, as Craig discussed we expect approximately $0.12 per share of accretion from the FCI transaction on revenues of approximately $570 million. Long-term, we look forward to capitalizing on the wide range of opportunities that will now be available to Amphenol, given our broader range of technologies and deeper penetration of customers in these many exciting markets that FCI brings us. And as we welcome this excellent new team to Amphenol, all I can say is that we remain very confident that our successful acquisition program will continue to create value for Amphenol into the future.","Now with respect to the 2015, there is no question that 2015 was a very strong year for the company, in particular given the many economic and geopolitical disruptions that emerged throughout the year. First, we expanded our position in the overall market, growing our sales by 4% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currencies, ultimately reaching that new sales record of $5.569 billion. In addition, we expanded our operating margins to the new record of 19.9% for the full year while generating EPS of $2.43, both excluding one-time items. This represented a growth of 8% in EPS from prior year. We also had as you all know a very busy year in our acquisition program as in addition to FCI, we acquired Invotec, DoCharm and ProCom earlier in the year. These acquisitions are going to create great value for the company, in fact already are creating that value as we expand our position across really most of our served markets. And in particular, we have now been joined by a great range of new talented managers thereby strengthening our already impressive management team.","In 2015, it\u2019s once again a reflection that our consistent focus on growing with the broadening array of customers across all of our diversified end markets has ultimately resulted in Amphenol strengthening our position across the many segments of the electronics industry. And in addition, our entrepreneurial organization has accelerated the development of innovative interconnect technologies in support of our simple but long-term mission to be the enabler of electronics revolution. These developments have allowed Amphenol to capitalize on exciting new markets and thereby have broadened the opportunity for our future expansion. While 2015 was not always an easy year, as we entered 2016 I can just say that our management team is highly confident that we have now built a new platform of strength from which we can drive even better long-term performance for many years to come.","Now turning towards our progress across our various served markets, I just want to comment that our team remains extremely focused on maintaining a balance and diversified market position. And this is really an asset that becomes even more valuable during times of economic uncertainty. And I think we all know that we are in those times. In 2015, not one of our end markets represented more than 19% of our sales and I will just say with the acquisition of FCI, we continue to expect that no market will make up even 20% of our sales as we now see it.","Turning to the markets, first the military market represented 10% of our sales in the fourth quarter and also 10% of our sales for the full year of 2015. Sales in the military market were down slightly in U.S. dollars and were flat in local currencies from prior year as growth in military airframe was offset by reductions in communications and rotorcraft. We were in fact pleased in the fourth quarter to see stronger than expected 4% sequential increase from the third quarter, with strength across most types of military equipment. For the full year 2015, our sales were down slightly in U.S. dollars and were up 2% in local currencies in the military market. While the overall market has remained basically stable in 2015, we are pleased to be seeing the early signs of some renewed growth. Our team has done an excellent job of strengthening our overall market position during these most recent more moderate years as we have continued to expand our high technology product offering across many complex new equipment platforms. Looking into 2016, while we expect sales in the first quarter to remain roughly at the levels of the fourth quarter, we now expect to achieve growth in the low single-digits for the full year as we realize the benefits of our expanded content on new military equipment and as certain new programs launch.","The Commercial Aerospace market represented 6% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 6% also for the full year. Sales were down by 4% in U.S. dollars and were flat in local currencies compared to prior year as stronger sales on to new airplane platforms were offset by reductions in commercial helicopter and business jet related sales. We were actually very encouraged during the quarter to achieve a strong 12% sequential increase from our third quarter sales levels, which was driven in particular by ramp ups of new large jet programs. For the full year 2015, our sales declined by 7% in U.S. dollars and just slightly in local currency driven by reductions in commercial helicopter and business jets sales. And we believe that that was related in part to the significant declines in the purchases of such equipment by oil and gas companies. Regardless of this more challenging market environment in 2015, we are very pleased with our continued progress across the commercial end market as we have taken excellent advantage of the proliferation of new electronics on next generation jetliners, which we are enabling with our broadened range of high-technology interconnect products. Looking ahead to 2016, we expect sales to remain at or slight above these levels in the first quarter and we expect to return to solid growth for the full year as production volumes of certain new planes ramp up, creating an exciting long-term opportunity for the company.","The industrial market represented 17% of our sales both in the quarter and for the full year. Sales in this market grew by actually a strong 7% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currency and that was driven in particular by growth in the hybrid bus and truck, heavy equipment and alternative energy segments as well as by some contribution from the Goldstar acquisition we made last year. And this was offset in part by significant and continued declines in our sales to customers in the oil and gas segment. Sequentially, our sales grew by a higher than expected 6%, resulting also from strength in those same segments.","For the full year of 2015, sales in the industrial market grew by 5% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency as the contributions from our acquisition program, together with that same strength in hybrid bus and truck, heavy equipment and alternative energy was in part offset by the significant declines in oil and gas. I can just say that we remain very proud of our diversified industrial businesses and we have continued to make progress selling an ever broader range of interconnect sensor and antenna products into the many growth segments of this market. Now with the addition of FCI, we have significantly strengthened our position across a wide array of embedded computing applications in the industrial market and we believe that this highly complementary offering is going to create an excellent long-term growth platform for the company.","For the first quarter, we anticipate sales to increase from the current levels due to the benefit from the FCI acquisition and looking towards the full year of 2016, we now expect sales growth in the high-teens in the industrial market for the full year as we benefit from contributions of FCI together with moderate organic growth from the many segments of the industrial market.","The automotive market represented 18% of our sales in the fourth quarter as well as in the full year of 2015. Sales in that market increased a very strong 5% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency. And this was driven by stronger sales of our products used in a wide array of new vehicle electronics. Sequentially, our sales were a bit stronger than expected and slightly exceeded our Q3 levels.","For the full year 2015, we are very pleased to have achieved another year of excellent growth as our sales grew by 23% in U.S. dollars, 33% in local currency and 12% organically. This is an outstanding year by any industry comparison for our automotive products. Our successful strategy has included driving an expanded range of interconnect and sensor products across a more diversified range of vehicles and onboard electronics around the world, while at the same time identifying complementary high-technology acquisitions. We look forward to continuing to realize the benefits from this approach for many years to come.","For the first quarter, we expect sales to increase moderately from current levels. And for the full year 2016, we expect to achieve mid to high single-digit growth as we continue to benefit from our recent acquisitions as well as our expanded range of automotive electronics into which our interconnect and sensor products are designed.","The mobile devices market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter and 19% of our sales for the full year 2015. Our performance in this market was actually somewhat stronger than we had expected as sales were essentially flat to prior year and down by 14% sequentially from our very strong third quarter. Once again, our team demonstrated their incredible dynamic agility as they were able to flex their resources quickly in the face of this sequential reduction, all while staying poised to capitalize on any upside opportunities for incremental sales that became available in the market. For the full year of 2015, our sales in the mobile devices market increased a very strong 13% from prior year, driven by growth in next-generation laptops, mobile accessories as well as production-related products for customers in the mobile market.","We remain very confident that our highly reactive and agile organization will continue to secure a strong position in the ever dynamic mobile devices market and are encouraged by our excellent technology positions that run across a wide range of new mobile computing platforms. In particular, mobile functionality continues to be integrated into an ever broader array of devices, expanding the growth opportunity for our interconnect and antenna products.","Looking into the first quarter, we now expect a sequential reduction in sales of approximately 30% due to normal seasonality as well as the impact from strong ramp-ups that occurred during the second half of 2015. This decline is roughly similar to the seasonal decline that we experienced in the first quarter of 2015. At this point, we expect sales for the full year 2016 to be slightly down from our 2015 levels. Regardless of this more muted outlook for 2016, we remain extremely confident that our dynamic and agile team has positioned us to benefit from any increases in demand that may arise in this always exciting market.","The mobile networks market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter as well as for the full year. And our sales in this market were a bit better than expected, but still declined from prior year by 7% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currencies. Sequentially, our sales were essentially flat to the third quarter as growth in sales to wireless equipment manufacturers was offset by a normal seasonal decline in sales to service providers. No question that 2015 was a very challenging year in the mobile infrastructure market as our sales declined 18% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency, primarily due to a pause in spending by many wireless operators around the world. Nevertheless, we have continued to expand our position with customers around the world in the mobile infrastructure market. And in particular, we have made great strides in developing new interconnect and antenna products that are integrated into next-generation wireless systems.","Looking into the first quarter as well as the full year 2016, we do expect a significant increase in our sales to the mobile infrastructure market due to the contributions from the FCI acquisition. While we do not at this time though expect overall spending environment to improve, our broadened product offering positions us better than ever before to capitalize on the opportunities that will arise when spending inevitably resumes in the future.","Now, turning to the information technology and datacom market, sales in this market represented 15% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 16% of our sales for the full year 2015. As we had expected, our sales were down slightly from prior year as well as prior quarter as sales moderated in products that are integrated into servers, storage and networking equipment. For the full year of 2015, our sales grew by 2% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currency as declines that we saw in storage and networking products were offset by increased sales into server applications, together with the strong progress that we have made selling into the new generation of web and datacenter customers. Regardless of this current moderation in growth, I could just say that we continue to make excellent progress in our development of advanced high-technology products as well as in our penetration of the many newly arising Web 2.0 and datacenter customers.","Now, with the acquisition of FCI, we have truly the leading product offering for customers across all areas of the IT datacom market and this positions us very strongly as customers adapt to deal with the significant expansion of data traffic in all aspects around the world. Both our traditional as well as the new generation of customers are driving their datacenter equipment to new levels of performance in order to handle the rapid expansion of data that\u2019s driven in particular by the proliferation of new mobile devices as well as by the continuing spread of video on the Internet and cloud computing. Looking ahead to the first quarter and the full year 2016, we expect a significant increase in our sales due to the FCI acquisition. And we continue to look forward to creating great long-term value with our many investments in this space.","Finally, the broadband communication market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter as well as for the full year. And sales decreased slightly in U.S. dollars and were flat in local currencies from prior year as domestic MSO build-out activity slowed due to the traditional seasonality in that space. Sales were down slightly from the third quarter because of that seasonality. For the full year, our sales were down by 5% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currency. And essentially, we were impacted by both the reduction in capital spending due to the many corporate consolidations that have occurred or are occurring in the broadband market together with the slowdown in spending by operators in certain regions, in particular Latin America, which as a result more due to the significant currency devaluations in that region.","For the first quarter, while we expect demand to increase moderately from our current levels, we do believe that it\u2019s still too early to expect growth for the full year of 2016. Nevertheless, as the industry eventually digests the many consolidations that are ongoing, we will be very well-positioned to capitalize with our expanded range of interconnect and cable products on the growth opportunities that will, no doubt, emerge.","So, let me just say with respect to 2015, I am just extremely proud of our performance. While the global economy did weaken throughout the course of the year and the market environment remains even today very uncertain, the Amphenol organization continued and continues to execute extraordinarily well, both organically as well as through our acquisition program to expand our market position while strengthening our financial performance. The company\u2019s superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, increasing position with customers in diverse markets, worldwide presence, our lean and very flexible cost structure combined all with our agile and entrepreneurial management team.","Now, turning to the outlook. As I have already mentioned several times, there continues to be a great deal of market uncertainty around the world and accordingly and based on a continuation of the current economic environment as well as on constant exchange rates, we now expect for the first quarter and the full year 2016 the following results. For the first quarter, we anticipate sales in the range of $1.380 billion to $1.420 billion and EPS excluding one-time items, in the range of $0.55 to $0.57 respectively. This represents a sales increase versus prior year of 4% to 7% in U.S. dollars and 6% to 9% in local currency and an EPS change of down 4% to flat the prior year. For the full year 2016, we expect sales in the range of $6.04 billion to $6.2 billion and EPS excluding one-time items, in the range of $2.54 to $2.62, respectively. For the full year, this represents sales and EPS growth of 8% to 11% and 5% to 8% over 2015 levels. In constant currencies, this guidance represents a year-over-year growth of 9% to 12%.","We are very, very encouraged by our current and strong outlook in sales and earnings, especially given the many dynamics across the global economy. And I am extremely confident that in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon our newly established record levels of revenues and EPS and to continue to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability in 2016.","And with that, Operator we would be very happy to take whatever questions there may be.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The question-and-answer period will now begin. Our first question came from the line of Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Matt Sheerin","Yes. Thanks and good afternoon and happy New Year Adam and Craig.","Adam Norwitt","Thank you.","Matt Sheerin","First, I have just a couple of questions actually on FCI. I know when you announced the deal last summer, I think you said it was at $600 million run rate for FY \u201815 and now you are guiding around $570 million this year, I know they have a lot of distribution exposure, what was the run rate coming out of 2015 and did they see the same weakness that other semiconductor and component suppliers saw in the distribution channel, was that why the number is lower now?","Adam Norwitt","Thank you very much for the question. I wouldn\u2019t actually say that it\u2019s related necessarily to distribution channel. At the time we gave the guidance, I think there is two aspects of why the $600 million becomes $570 million. Number one is FCI certainly was impacted by currency as other companies were. They have similar, if not even slightly more exposure to certain currencies. And so there is a significant impact of currency translation. In addition, we closed on the deal in January 8, so we lose a solid week of sales in the year. And I would just tell you that if you think about the markets where FCI is, we have what I consider a relatively prudent and conservative outlook in those markets looking forward. And I would say that FCI is no different than that. But I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that there is any significant change in terms of distribution that is any different from what maybe we have seen nothing. That\u2019s not the big thing happening.","Matt Sheerin","Got it. And I know you talked about, Craig mentioned the plan to improve margins and get the FCI operating margins to the Amphenol level, could you give us a little bit more color on how you plan to get there in potential timeframe?","Craig Lampo","Sure, be happy to do that. As we previously mentioned, we don\u2019t integrate companies in a traditional sense. We certainly will look at the overall cost, cost structure and to maximize certainly the value of their great technology that they do have. I think what we will do is, over time look at certainly all these aspects of their cost structure, look at their organizational structure and whatnot and certainly we will be able to \u2013 we are confident we will be able to increase the margins over that time. This is certainly not going to be an overnight action. We are certainly in the process of working with management to go through kind of the details of the organization. But we are very confident and that we would be able to bring the profitability levels up over some time period.","Adam Norwitt","Yes. And the only thing that I would maybe add to that is the management team from FCI, they have also that same aspiration. We have seen this in many times with acquisitions that we have made where the performance of that company has may be at somewhat less of a level than ours. They always from the outside, say how is it that they can do it and as soon as they come into Amphenol, they start to see how there is that sort of cultural ability to achieve those high margins and there is nothing better than a little bit of a peer interaction to help that same management team find ways to spend less or sell the product at a higher value wherever that may be. Ultimately, with FCI just like it is with every one of our businesses, it comes down to the margin is the price less the cost and I think that there will be many actions that can be taken on both sides of that equation. But the most important action is already there, which is that the team is committed to it. When does it happen, ultimately what\u2019s the timing of that, this is a very hard thing to predict at this stage. And I think we have taken an approach to guide towards the margins as they are today. Over time, though we remain very confident that we will bring that to close to if not above the levels of the company.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amit Daryanani","Perfect. Thanks. I have a question and a follow-up as well. So I guess maybe to start up on FCI question, Adam when you guys announced the deal, you also talked about low to mid-teens operating margins of FCI, I think the guidance implies 9% or so operating margins, so just maybe explain what\u2019s the delta there if there is mark to market accounting or something else that\u2019s driving it lower?","Adam Norwitt","Yes. I think what Craig mentioned is that it\u2019s low double-digit operating margins in the company. As you know when you make an acquisition, there are various things you have to do with amortization and other aspects that are related to acquisitions. But we think that that\u2019s a low double-digit operating income company today.","Amit Daryanani","Got it. And then just broadly, given the market volatility you are seeing, I would love to get your perspective on your desire to execute further deals post FCI. And really as you look at deals moving forward, your leverage is around 1.7 times I think right now, is there an appetite to do $1 billion plus kind of transactions as they come up or would like to do more to tuck-in deals as you go forward?","Adam Norwitt","Yes. I think we have always said and we remain very committed to the fact that we want to stay as an investment grade company. In particular, when markets are turbulent like they are today, I think the investment grade rating is a very important thing. That being said, we still have a lot of capacity. And I think Craig talked about that that we have still significant capacity remaining even where we were to get to investment grade. The reality is our position as an acquirer of preference for companies around the world, that has not changed and that continues to grow and we have an excellent pipeline of acquisitions. Are we going to make another FCI tomorrow, I guess probably not. But do we have a great pipeline of acquisitions, a variety of sizes and are we committed to continuing to drive our acquisition program, which has created so much value for the company, no doubt about it we are still very committed to that program.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mike Wood of Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Mike Wood","Hi, excellent job navigating this very tough market. First question, just wanted to get some help on the guidance bridge, it looks like the currency that you had guided to roughly offsets the FCI accretion, so I am just curious with flat organic growth if you could just maybe point to one or two things that\u2019s driving the majority that roughly $0.15 earnings bridge to your midpoint. And I am wondering embedded in that if there is some prior acquisition margin ramps like from advanced sensors or something?","Adam Norwitt","Yes. I think Mike, it\u2019s not quite clear what you are asking, but it appears that what you are asking is did we have here a slightly higher conversion margin on our organic sales. And if that\u2019s what you are asking, there is maybe a slightly higher conversion margin on that. We have an environment right now that we think there can be some slight positive impact from some of the commodity benefits that we had. And we started to see, Craig mentioned that we saw a little bit of benefit in the quarter in our cable business. And you can bet that our team is being very aggressive on that. But overall, we think that is still a guidance that is well in line with the profitability trends of the company.","Mike Wood","Okay, great. That\u2019s exactly what I wanted to understand. And then just Adam from your perspective managing the business, is there any \u2013 in terms of how you manage day-to-day given this market volatility, what do you do proactively, do you react to market movements to try to cut costs in front of potential contagion risk or are you just sort of looking at how trends are coming in and running it as a normal course of business?","Adam Norwitt","So I am going to be a little flip in a second, which is to say that we spent two decades building a culture of a company that has then the inherent agility at the Street management level to react to changes. That\u2019s number one thing we do. That\u2019s not something you can do overnight. It\u2019s something we have spent the better part of two decades kind of incubating and developing in the culture of the company. And I think I have mentioned many times in the past for those especially who followed us through many cycles that in a time of turbulence, this is really when the Amphenol management team excels the most, because we have around the world 90 plus general managers. Those general managers are facing customers every day as they are going back from the customers with the information that they have gathered and they are going into the factory to allocate and arrange their resources. And you can bet in certain times that they are hearing from customers not positive news and when they are hearing not positive news, they don\u2019t report to someone who reports to someone who reports to someone at headquarters and then we make sort of a big decision about what to do, they go back to their factory that say, hey, I don\u2019t see the orders, I better adjust my resources and that can mean cutting cost with people, that can mean cutting spending, that can mean redeploying towards growth opportunities, whatever it is. That\u2019s the essence of the agility that is embodied and really across this entire organization. So, in a time like this where everybody wants to sort of buckle their seatbelts, because it doesn\u2019t feel like a very smooth flight, this is when the Amphenol team buys new pairs of shoes, gets out there, makes sure that they are getting real-time information from customers, goes back, make some real-time cost adjustments, real-time resource reallocations to make sure that we preserve strong operating performance and we expand our market position. That\u2019s the playbook that we have had through many cycles. God forbid, if we go into a cycle like that, we are going to have that same playbook.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Sherri Scribner","Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask a quick question, Craig, on the assumptions for SG&A as we move into fiscal \u201816. How should we model SG&A with the FCI acquisition trying to understand what hits SG&A and what hits the gross margin line for FCI?","Craig Lampo","Sure. No problem. Yes, in regards to SG&A, as you know, the company Amphenol continues to tightly manage SG&A to maximize return on certainly this very important customer-facing resource of the company, we have always deployed a very strong return on investment policy with both our sales and engineering efforts. With the inclusion of FCI which currently carries a higher level of SG&A, we expect to see an increase in our SG&A for 2016 with our overall SG&A percent probably increasing about 80 to 90 basis points, I would think probably you can include. And then if you want to think about on the gross margin side, I would just add that although FCI does have slightly lower margins, I wouldn\u2019t think that that\u2019s going to have such an impact on the company overall.","Sherri Scribner","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then Adam, I wanted to ask you a big picture question. You mentioned a number of times that there is a lot of uncertainty in the market. It seems like the industrial segment has gotten a little bit weaker. There is a lot of concern about China. Could you maybe talk about what you are seeing maybe specifically in China and then also what you are seeing on the industrial side? I know you provided some detail, but it was a little bit masked by the growth related to FCI. Thanks.","Adam Norwitt","Sure. I mean, I think what we saw in the fourth quarter relative to industrial was actually a pretty positive result compared to what we had thought coming into the quarter. You remember, Sherri, very well as we came into the quarter, we saw some signs of a pullback from customers in the industrial market. And it seemed to be really very much related to this turbulence in the many emerging markets. I think I gave a lot of credit to our organization and by the way some of that organization in China that we have worked to identify where there are segments of growth in industrial. So, I mentioned maybe a new piece of business that we haven\u2019t talked about before as part of industrial and that\u2019s this whole universe of hybrid transportation equipment. As an example, our team just did a phenomenal job over the last year or two to ferret out this whole new area that is there that is really harsh environment, hybrid performance going into things like buses and trucks. And as you probably know, China is an area where that is happening more than any place in the world. And so the reality is actually our business in China in the fourth quarter did pretty well, because we had really ferreted out some of these new things. I mean, you think we grew in industrial year-over-year 10% in local currencies in the quarter and that\u2019s with oil and gas being down by a very, very significant amount. As we look at the guidance going into the year, I think we continue to have a favorable outlook for the industrial market. Organically, we expect it to be kind of mid single-digit growth for the year. And I think that that\u2019s a very robust outlook actually given all what one reads in the paper everyday, which seems to be not a great time to be reading paper these last few days. So, I think that \u2013 and that\u2019s coming again from our organization really poking their necks everywhere they can and ferreting out growth opportunities and then executing really fast to capitalize on those and to redeploy the resources towards those growth opportunities.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. You may now ask your question.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes, thanks. Adam, you highlighted just the strength of the combined company with FCI and IT. Any other end markets you trust in terms of where you will have more of a critical mass or strategic place? And then also from a geographic perspective kind of what FCI does for you?","Adam Norwitt","Sure. Thank you very much, Craig. I definitely hired an IT. I think I also mentioned in mobile infrastructure where we have just a tremendous span of presence. And then industrial, I talked about the fact that what we get with FCI is something that we have really never had and we have in all honesty struggled to build organically, which is a real pervasive presence across embedded computing on a broad sense. And the embedded computing revolution that\u2019s happening in the industrial market whether that be in places like factory automation, in energy management, in heavy equipment, wherever I mean you can go up and down the list of industrial applications where they are putting more sensors and there is more processing power and thus there is more embedded computing. And it is that sort of excellent job that the FCI team has done to repurpose essentially very robust computer interconnect products, some of which are not so new, but repurposing them into those embedded computing applications where the reliability of the product becomes such a premium. So, I think those we see all really, really real strengthening of our position.","Relative to geographic, I think that FCI, as we have talked about in the past, they have a significant position in Asia, but they also have a very strong position in the North American and European distribution channels. And I view that the strength in the distribution channel is really one and the same with the geographical strength that it brings, because it allows us access with those types of products that we haven\u2019t had in the past. So, I think that there is really strength both from market and a regional perspective.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. And then just as my follow-up, in mobile devices, you guys have done a good job growing that business, as we see smartphones start to slow and you guys have also kind of navigated and your end market mix has shifted overtime with new opportunities. So just curious, as that market slows, do you think you can still drive new opportunities or content or will you see better growth opportunities in other end markets as you go forward?","Adam Norwitt","Well, look I think I have just said relative to our guidance that we do expect that market to be down moderately coming into 2016. It\u2019s a very volatile space. It\u2019s one where we came in to 2015 with relatively muted expectations. Ultimately, our team was able really to outperform in that space growing for the full year essentially by 13%, which was certainly not what we had expected coming into the year. But it is a very hard market to kind of put a line in the sand on and say that\u2019s \u2013 we do anticipate to grow. So, we are taking what I believe is the prudent, but a necessarily prudent approach to our outlook for the market. That being said, I tell you that we continue to grow our position. And we grow our position with a range of customers. Obviously, it\u2019s not like there is millions of customers out there. So, there is some concentration in the customer base, but we continue to diversify. We continue to attract new applications. If you look at where the growth came this year, it wasn\u2019t necessarily, for example, from something like tablets, which several years ago had driven a lot of our growth. We saw more growth coming out of new-generation interconnected laptops, which years ago, we didn\u2019t work in laptops. And now, we seem to have built a very significant business there as laptops become essentially mobile devices. So, what will it ultimately be? What will the kind of new architecture of mobile be? This is very hard for us to predict. Will we continue to have a very strong position and will we capitalize on every opportunity that we see? No doubt about it. And I think nobody executes like the Amphenol team in the mobile devices market.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. Adam, can you comment on the auto end market, it\u2019s been very strong growth for your organically, how are you viewing production versus content growth and any regional color that you might share would also be helpful here in 2016 and I have a follow-up?","Adam Norwitt","Great. Thank you very much, Wamsi. I think I have already shied away from talking too much about content versus unit volume. To be honest, we don\u2019t pay for all these reports. I couldn\u2019t even tell you exactly what content growth is and what unit volume growth is. I think I read the same papers, but I know there is lots of other detailed studies that we don\u2019t pay for. What I can tell you is our growth is clearly above the market. When we look at our performance here in the year of 2015, whether that was in the fourth quarter or whether that was the full year, growing 12% organically for the year, growing 33% in local currencies, there is no question, this is a very strong report. And as we look into 2016, I think we continue to have a strong guidance with real mid to high single-digit organic growth and a very positive outlook there. So where does that come from, it\u2019s clearly not just coming from units. I think that\u2019s very clear. So it\u2019s coming from our penetration to new applications, what I would say is a broadening range of new applications and also a broadened base of customers. I mentioned during my prepared remarks that we have made a lot of excellent acquisitions. And one of the great things that we have got through our acquisition program in automotive beyond just the product capability is access to OEMs and vehicle manufacturers where traditionally we may not have had that open door. And I think that, that has been a real great asset, in particular as we now have a product offering ranging from interconnect to sensors and even to antennas in the automotive market. From a regional perspective, I would just tell you that in the quarter, we actually saw on a year-over-year basis not bad performance in a place like Asia. Actually sequentially even we grew in Asia by double digits and I think the difference between our original expectations in the automotive market and ultimately, the results that we were able to get was in part due to a great job that our team did in Asia to drive sales.","Wamsi Mohan","Thanks Adam. Thanks for the color. For my follow-up, on mobile devices did you see incremental deterioration on demand as you went through the course of the quarter and your guidance was slightly down year-on-year for the full year, is that a function of just market declines or is there any share changes options within that and do you have any production related accessories sales that you expect in 2016? Thanks.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes. So the answer \u2013 let me answer it in reverse order. We do continue to have some production related accessories sales in 2016. I think that over the course of the fourth quarter, you naturally see a declining rate of sales during the quarter because the beginning of the quarter tends to be stronger sales than towards the end of the quarter. So I think that we would have expected that and we did see that. I mentioned that our sales in the quarter were a little stronger than we had come into but still over the course from October through to December, certainly you saw lower sales in December than you saw in October. And with respect to our guidance for the full year, we do not anticipate any share loss across. But on the other hand, we don\u2019t win everything. So there is always new programs, there is always new positions that you have on new products, but there is no share loss that we would note or that we have noted across any of our business in mobile. It is just a volatile space where each new thing comes out, you fight for as much content as you can get. And then you see how many the customers are going to sell of it. And then you react accordingly and you get your resources in the right position to support that demand.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Steven Fox of Cross Research. You may now ask your question.","Steven Fox","Thanks very much. Good afternoon. I was just curious Adam, if we could \u2013 if you could talk a little bit higher level about the markets. You are calling for about flat organic growth for the full year, my understanding of the company is historically you do better than the markets which seems implied more of your markets going down and up, I was curious which markets you are most concerned about under that premise and which ones do you think have some organic growth prospects besides your own ability to grow above the market that you can take advantage, which ones are more positive? And then I had a follow-up.","Adam Norwitt","Thank you very much, Steve. I think I would \u2013 I think I went over most of that in the prepared remarks, but I would just say that we have probably a more positive view of military, of commercial air, industrial and automotive and we have a less positive view of mobile devices, broadband, wireless infrastructure and IT datacom. I think that in a nutshell, how we see the markets. I think those latter four markets we would expect to be essentially flattish organically at a market level. Obviously, we have a big impact on wireless infrastructure and IT datacom with FCI. So we will report certainly strong sales growth in those markets. But our organic expectations are more muted in that space. On the contrary, we feel very good about automotive, about industrial, aerospace. And as I mentioned very early on, we start to see some renewed signs, green shoots, if you will of growth in the military market.","Steven Fox","Great. And then if I could just follow-up real quickly on the FCI deal, my understanding is that a lot of the value, obviously not all of the value was with the technology that you mentioned in the data center and datacom area, can you just sort of talk about how that may be either accelerate your growth or how you take advantage of those products as part of Amphenol a little bit more, you have alluded to it a few times, but if there is any examples you can give, that would be great?","Adam Norwitt","Sure. No, look I think number one, I would just modify it slightly, which is we see a lot of benefit of the product and the technologies from FCI in the IT datacom, but we also see that in mobile infrastructure and we see that absolutely in the industrial space where we also have very complementary and additive high-technology products. But with respect to IT datacom, we have talked for several quarters about the real transformation that\u2019s happening in that space, where you have a kind of generational shift whereby the balance of power is moving towards these service providers, be they are web service providers, data center service providers or whatever you want to call them. And many of those are really kind of calling the technology shots today whereas before, they were just unpacking boxes of stuff and configuring it. And I think in such an environment, the ability to present to those customers are kind of an A to Z product offering that helps them reach their price performance requirements is more critical than ever before. It used to be that you could have a couple of pillar products, you could work with the couple of box builders and you could know that, that product was what the box builder needed. Today, the range of customers that you have to work with and interface with is so much broader that if you don\u2019t have a product offering that fills essentially every hole, whether that be in high-speed connectors, whether that be in power connectors, in I\/Os, in cable assemblies, you run the real risk of missing out on the one that ultimately will grow. And I think with FCI, we eliminate that risk wholeheartedly. We get a total A to Z offering. We can walk into customers of any nature and say you tell us what you need and we have it, somewhere on that ultimate price performance curve that the products all fall on. And I think that that is something that will over the long-term, pay great dividends for the company. Obviously, here I am talking about an IT datacom market in 2016, where we had a more modest expectation. But I think that is something that is commensurate with the market environment that we are in. It is a very uncertain environment. IT spending also it\u2019s a capital item and I think that at the end of the day, capital spending tends to be a bit more constrained when the markets are crazy like they are today. Ultimately though, data is flowing at speeds unlike we have ever imagined, applications are growing logarithmically and people need to equip their data centers and their networks with the equipment ultimately that can handle those speeds. And we are going to have the best solution for it.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","Shawn Harrison","Good afternoon Adam.","Adam Norwitt","Hello Shawn.","Shawn Harrison","Wanted to just get into I guess the mobile networks business, it sounds like you have a dour outlook again for the market and I am wondering if there is any signs of life out there because it\u2019s been probably about 18 months since we have seen I think any positive growth and all regions were down in 2015 and so if can you just maybe comment on what you are seeing globally in that market and if there is the potential for it to rebound at any point in time in the year?","Adam Norwitt","Sure. I mean look, dour and dour, I think we have an outlook essentially for the market organically to be at about the level that is it this year. So, that\u2019s certainly less dour than it was in 2015 when we were down 13% in local currencies. I think 2014 we were up by a significant amount. If I recall, 23%, 24% increase. So, I don\u2019t know about six quarters, even if maybe the first half of 2014 was a little stronger than the second half. I think in the fourth quarter, essentially our sales were flat to the third quarter and that is in a quarter where normally you would be down sequentially. So, if you talk about signs of life, I think one could interpret that flat performance in the fourth quarter where normally you see that to be down is maybe not the worst sign that one ever sees. I think that ultimately, they will \u2013 there is developing like there was last time a pent-up demand for capacity and coverage that needs to be, one day, solved. And to solve that pent-up demand, it will take equipment, it will take antennas, it will take the interconnect products that we have and it will be upon us who has really the broadest range of products at least in our industry to support both the OEMs and the operators. In fact, last quarter, I think I mentioned we actually saw growth from the OEMs on a year-over-year basis and that was the first quarter in I would say three or four that we saw OEM growth in wireless infrastructure. It is normal in the fourth quarter to see the operators down a little bit.","From a regional basis, I would tell you that we have seen actually pretty good performance in North America in the wireless infrastructure market at least in the recent quarter. And we have started to see actually in Asia some pretty solid signs here, in particular in place like India. India is going through quite a significant infrastructure build. We seem to be at the early stages of that. And our team has done an excellent job to position ourselves. I am never going to bet on India in terms of a market, but I will tell you that we are very strongly positioned in India and to the extent that they do ultimately build that the levels that they have that can be also another sign of life for mobile networks.","Shawn Harrison","Okay. And then as a follow-up, just I think the free cash flow dynamics of Amphenol are well understood, but what is the free cash flow profile of FCI like is it very similar to Amphenol? So we expect similar free cash flow return of the FCI business for fiscal \u201816 as Amphenol generates?","Adam Norwitt","Yes. I would say that it\u2019s actually very similar to Amphenol. So, that\u2019s I think a good way to think about it.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Will Stein of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Will Stein","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Adam, I am wondering if you can give us an update on your sensor product category traction with clients and remind us, is the end market exposure there tilted somewhat towards automotive or industrial? And any update on that category would be helpful.","Adam Norwitt","Yes, I think we feel very pleased. We just finished two years as a sensor company. In fact, we acquired the GE advanced sensor business. I think it was December 5, 2013. So, it really just finished our two years. And I can tell you that we feel really good about the progress and we added obviously Casco a year later and that is \u2013 I can just say that that\u2019s a very positive impression, both with our customers as well as internally. There has been a lot of collaborative initiatives between engineers across the company. We have seen some nice wins with customers where maybe they would not have had access and we have also seen great reception from some customers where we didn\u2019t have a strong access before with our interconnect products. So I tell you from my perspective I give it a real strong grade, a solid A, let me say, in terms of our experience.","In terms of the end market exposure, advanced sensors when we bought it was about two-thirds industrial, one-third automotive and then Casco was essentially all automotive. So, I would say that our business is roughly balanced between automotive and industrial. And within industrial, again there is a diversification ranging from heavy equipment to medical to automated building products and things like that. So, there is a great diversification in that. And within the automotive, there is a very strong geographical diversification and OEM diversification as well as the types of sensors, pressure and temperature and otherwise the types of sensors that we are selling into those applications. So, we feel great about the deals. We feel great about the progress so far. And we continue to actively look for new ways to expand both organically and through acquisition.","Will Stein","If I can just follow-up with one more, we have talked a bit \u2013 you have talked a bit today about what sounds like a bit more of a uniqueness or strategic benefit of FCI and that\u2019s in the embedded end market. Is that \u2013 am I summarizing that correctly? Are there other end markets where there is a more unique advantage that FCI builds out for Amphenol? It was my impression that the company\u2019s exposure to distribution might be part of that.","Adam Norwitt","Yes. I mean, distribution, we have talked about from day one with FCI that it is a great asset for us. 40% of their sales are through distribution. And I think I have mentioned before, but I will reiterate that the strength that we see is not that we are not exposed to those distributors, we certainly are and we are bigger than they are, those distributors, but they are exposed to the part of those distributors that markets into areas that we have not been successful. So, we have been very strong with our harsh environment, military, aerospace and industrial products and they have been much stronger in identifying and working with distributors on new IT datacom, embedded computing and all of those areas where we just have not had the traction, because we didn\u2019t have the shelf space of the products. And so I think that is a big advantage.","Industrial is one which I have already spoken extensively about today. I think that in the IT datacom market, FCI did an outstanding job. And I would say in part because they have just a phenomenal reach into places like Taiwan and China. They did a fabulous job attacking the new generation of ODM and new generation of IT datacom, new customers, the nontraditional, let me say. And while our team has done also an excellent job there, FCI was even a few steps ahead of us in that respect. And so I think that\u2019s another real additive thing that we get with FCI. The other thing that we get with FCI irrespective of the market position is capabilities that are truly second to none in certain respects, plating technology, manufacturing in certain areas, low cost areas of products that we don\u2019t make in those areas. So, there is a whole range also of capabilities that we are very excited about. And I can tell you, our respective teams are spending a lot of time together right now to identify kind of the low hanging fruit around where the collaboration can create value for the company.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is now open.","Jim Suva","Thank you and congratulations to you and your team there at Amphenol. I have a question and a follow-up and I will ask them at the same time. The question is I think I heard you, Adam, talk about mobility of being down 30%, which if my numbers are right, it look like that\u2019s pretty normal. So, if you can just confirm that? But the real question is then I think I heard you say you expect it to be down slightly for this year. And I kind of scratch my head, because the smartphone market is expected to grow. So, are you kind of deemphasizing some things or is your exposure causing you to do that just because it\u2019s really not like the industry is expecting the handset industry to be down. I mean, there is some other part of the business I am missing. And then the follow-up question is on the industrial side, it seems like we saw some strength and if I heard right, correctly, the hybrid bus and truck did well. Is that sustainable or is that more driven by some credits or some type of programs that came up and went away or just kind of wondering because it\u2019s kind of surprising and encouraging to hear about strength in industrial? Thank you.","Adam Norwitt","Sure. Thank you, Jim. These are three very good questions. With respect to mobility, I think you did the right calculation, 30% down. And as I said, that\u2019s similar to what we saw in prior year and I think even for the last three years almost. And I think I already addressed our outlook for the year. I will just summarize maybe, which is that yes, we do see that our sales will be down slightly for the year. We take a very prudent approach to this market. It\u2019s a market that\u2019s extremely hard to predict and one that\u2019s volatile. We came into 2015 also with a very muted expectation. And ultimately, we did a lot better. But that was not something that you can see coming into the year. What are the expectations for smartphone growth? What are the expectations for tablets, for laptops, for all the accessories that are there? I don\u2019t know. If you add them all up together, does that reflect the market that is growing or not growing? I think you can read five reports and get five different answers right now. So, what we do is we guide based on what we are seeing. But as I said earlier, we are not expecting and nor do we anticipate any losses per se. And I think I addressed that already. With respect to industrial, I mentioned this kind of new and exciting area of hybrid heavy trucks and buses and is that related to credit, I don\u2019t know necessarily that that\u2019s related to credits. I think it\u2019s related to really dirty air. And so I think that there is a lot of places in the world who are coming to terms with the fact that their air is not breathable and they are doing things about it. And I don\u2019t know that, that is necessarily a short-term trend. I think that is a trend that is probably at the beginning stages of such a trend. Will that always be a driver of growth over time, we will see. But I think our team has done a great job to position themselves and position ourselves in a new and exciting area and what is otherwise an industrial market that certainly sees its ups and downs.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question came from the line of Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Mark Delaney","Yes. Good afternoon and thanks very much for taking the questions. First question was on FCI, of the $570 million forecast for this year, can you help us understand the split between your different end markets, so is it a quarter industrial and 50% IT datacom, etcetera?","Adam Norwitt","Yes. We are not going to dive too deeply into the real specific splits of FCI, but let\u2019s just say in order I would say it\u2019s IT datacom, industrial, mobile infrastructure and then automotive and a little bit of mobile devices, kind of in that order.","Mark Delaney","Okay. And then for a follow-up question also on FCI, I mean I know traditionally, Amphenol runs the companies that it acquires independently unless its franchises, I mean just given the size of FCI and you talked about a plan to improve the margins, are you expecting to do anything there differently in terms of integrating some of the manufacturing where some of the Amphenol products are built in former FCI factories, etcetera?","Adam Norwitt","Yes. No, we are not integrating it per se. We are not restructuring, closing, consolidating facilities. The one thing we are doing is that we have running FCI as of the time it\u2019s joined Amphenol an individual who has been with Amphenol for a long time. He was actually the individual who shepherded us \u2013 shepherded the TCS company into Amphenol 10 years before. He has been with the company \u2013 with TCS for more than 27 years, been with Amphenol for more than a decade and he knows exactly what it takes to bring a large enterprise into Amphenol and to really go through the cultural transformation that is something that takes time, but takes also great focus. The prior executive running FCI, who is also a fabulous individual as part of a private equity sale, that was natural that he would be moving on and we were very happy that the whole current management team who now reports to the gentleman who is running that as part of Amphenol. They are very strong robust and excited to be part of the team. And they are doing that under the leadership of someone who has gone through this exact same transformation in a very, very successful fashion in years past. So otherwise, we are not mushing things together. We are not going through radical transformations. But we are doing the things that are necessary from an operating standpoint as Craig alluded to, to get the margins up. And long-term, in Amphenol, it\u2019s not like we have sacred cows and we say nothing can go, we are going to be very thoughtful about that. But at the end of the day, we feel that that is an enterprise that is going to be a high performance enterprise going forward.","Adam Norwitt","Very good. I think that is our final question. So on behalf of Craig and I we again wish you all happy New Year.

[Operator Instructions] At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Ms. Diana Reardon. Ma'am, you may begin.","Diana G. Reardon","Thank you. My name is Diana Reardon, and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. And we'd like to welcome you, all, to our third quarter earnings call.","Q3 results were released this morning. I'll provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question-and-answer session.","The company closed the third quarter with sales of $1.153 billion and EPS of $0.98 before onetime items, meeting the high end of the company's guidance and achieving new sales and EPS records. Sales were up 5% in U.S. dollars and 4% in local currencies compared to Q3 of 2012. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and foreign exchange impacts, sales in Q3 2013 were equal to last year. Sequentially, sales were up 1% in U.S. dollars and 1% organically from Q2 of 2013.","Breaking down sales into our 2 major components. Our Cable business, which comprised 8% of our sales in the quarter, was up 28% from last year, primarily as a result of a 2012 acquisition. The Interconnect business, which comprised 92% of our sales, was up about 3% from last year, as a result of both increased demand and prior year acquisitions. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.","Operating income, excluding onetime items, was $227 million in the quarter. Operating margin, excluding onetime items, was 19.7%, up 20 basis points from 19.5% in Q3 2012, a good conversion margin on incremental sales of approximately 23% from last year. From a segment perspective, in the cable market, margins were 13.8%, up from 12.4% last year, primarily due to the positive impact of last year's acquisition. In the Interconnect segment, margins were 22%, up from 21.7% last year. The year-over-year Interconnect operating margin improvement primarily reflects the positive impacts of higher volume and cost reduction actions.","We're very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement, and we continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and culture of cost control allows us to act in a fast and flexible manner, thereby, constantly adjusting the business to maximize profitability in what clearly continues to be a very dynamic environment. Through the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance.","The company has recorded acquisition costs in the quarter of approximately $2.5 million, $2.1 million on an after-tax basis or $0.01 per share. The costs include professional fees and other external expenses relating primarily to the acquisition in October of Ionix, disclosed in the press release. Interest expense for the quarter was $16 million compared to $15.2 million last year, reflecting higher average debt levels from the company's stock buyback program. Other income was $3.6 million in the quarter, up from $2.6 million last year, primarily as a result of higher interest income and higher levels of cash and short-term cash investments.","The company's effective tax rate, excluding the impact of onetime items, was approximately 25.5% in Q3 2013 compared to 26.8% in Q3 2012. As is contemplated in our guidance, the Q3 tax rate, excluding the impact of onetime items, reflects the year-to-date adjustment to bring the company's full year effective tax rate to approximately 26.3%. On an as-reported basis, the Q3 2013 effective tax rate was 23.9% and included the impact of a net benefit of $4 million or $0.02 per share relating primarily to the completion of prior year audits. For the full year 2013, excluding the effect of onetime items, we currently expect a tax rate of approximately 26.3%, and this compares to a full year effective tax rate in 2012 of 26.6%.","Net income, excluding onetime items, was approximately 13.8% of sales, and EPS, excluding onetime items, increased 9% to $0.98 in the quarter, up from $0.90 last year, a strong performance. On an as-reported basis, EPS was $0.99 in the third quarter and included a cost of $0.01 per share relating to the $2.5 million of acquisition-related transaction costs and the tax benefit of $0.02 per share I just described. Orders for the quarter were $1.145 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 0.99:1.","The company had excellent cash flow in the quarter. Cash flow from operations was a strong $197 million or approximately 122% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. The company had good working capital performance in the quarter. Inventory was $733 million at the end of September. Inventory days were 84 days, up 1 day from our prior year-end levels. Accounts receivable was $926 million at the end of September. Days sales outstanding was 72 days and comparable to prior year-end levels. Account payables stood at $481 million at the end of September, and from a days perspective, payable days were 55 days, down 1 day from last year-end.","The strong operating cash flow, along with proceeds from option exercises of $18 million and borrowings under the company's revolving credit facilities of $87 million, were used to fund capital expenditures of $39 million in the quarter, the purchase of 1.5 million shares of the company's stock for $116 million, the payment of approximately $3 million in fees relating to the previously reported July amendment of the company's revolving credit facility, dividend payments of $17 million, and an increase in cash and cash investments of $141 million in the quarter. At the end of September, the company had 6 million shares remaining under its stock repurchase program, which expires in January of 2015. At September 30, cash and short-term investments were $1.284 billion, the majority of which is held outside the U.S.","Debt at the end of the quarter was $1.87 billion, bringing net debt to approximately $586 million at the end of the quarter. Borrowings and availability under the company's $1.5 billion revolving credit facility were $683 million and $187 million, respectively. The company's leverage and interest coverage ratios remain very strong at 1.8 and 17x, respectively, and EBITDA in the quarter was approximately $278 million.","From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter. Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends.","R. Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much, Diana, and I'd like to extend my welcome to everybody on the phone today. As Diana mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the third quarter, and in particular, I'll discuss the trends and progress across our various served markets. Then, finally, I'll make a few comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter, as well as the full year 2013.","As Diana reviewed, we achieved new records in sales and earnings per share in the third quarter, growing from prior year by 5% and 9%, respectively. We are very pleased with these results, most especially given the increasingly heightened levels of uncertainty across the global economy. Our operating margins in the quarter remained very strong, as we secured a continuation of our industry-leading operating margins at 19.7%. These results just make me very proud of our agile and entrepreneurial Amphenol organization, every management team member of which is capitalizing on the opportunities created by the electronics revolution and are really demonstrating the discipline and drive necessary to create strong operating performance for the company.","Acquisitions continue to be an integral component of our growth strategy. In that regard, we're very pleased to have added Ionix Aerospace Systems to the Amphenol family here in the first week of October. Ionix is a U.K.- and Estonia-based manufacturer of harsh-environment interconnect assemblies for the commercial aerospace market, with annual sales of approximately $35 million. This excellent acquisition is a strong complement to our leading offering of high-technology interconnect products for the European aerospace market, and in particular, enhances our position on aircraft engine interconnect. It's also very consistent with our longstanding strategy to acquire complementary companies with strong management, leading technology and excellent market presence. So as we welcome this outstanding new team to Amphenol, we remain very confident that our strong pipeline of acquisitions will continue to create significant value for the company in the future.","The Amphenol management team continues to devote tremendous efforts towards our ongoing market, customer and product diversification, thereby ensuring that our market diversity remains a significant asset for the company. This is particularly critical during these very uncertain economic times.","So now turning to those served markets. The military market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter, and sales were down 3% from prior year and 6% from prior quarter, as growth in airframe, rotary wing aircraft and ordnance applications was offset by overall reduced demand in other segments of the military market. The conservatism that we've seen in the purchasing behavior of defense equipment makers has clearly not abated, and indeed, recent uncertainties surrounding the overall United States budget situation may create even more wariness on the part of customers.","Nevertheless, there continues to be a high level of design activity targeted at creating new electronic functionalities in military equipment, combined with further growth opportunities that we're seeing in developing geographies. We expect demand in the military market to increase from these lower levels in the fourth quarter, as we benefit from traditional seasonality, as well as from the impact of some of these new military programs with higher electronic content. However, given the ongoing budget discussions in the U.S., there clearly remains potential for renewed caution from customers in the near term.","The commercial aerospace market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased a very strong 27% from prior year and 2% sequentially, as we continue to capitalize on a strong increase in production volumes of existing and next-generation commercial aircraft. Our efforts at gaining a broad technology position on the next generation of airliners have paid strong dividends. We've been able to expand our content on a wide array of new platforms, several of which are beginning to enter mass production this year.","Accordingly, we have a stronger position across this range of applications than ever before, as our new interconnect technologies are resolving a wide variety of challenges faced by customers designing and building next-generation aircraft. Looking towards the fourth quarter, we expect a significant uptick in demand in the Commercial Air market, as we benefit from the contributions from the Ionix acquisition, together with increasing demand for our products incorporated into these new jetliners.","The industrial market represented 14% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased 9% from prior year, primarily as a result of contributions from the DC Electronics acquisition. Growth in factory automation, medical, heavy equipment and rail mass transit was offset by reduced demand from customers in the energy-related segments. Sequentially, our sales increased a strong 9% in the quarter.","As general economic uncertainty is impacting demand in the overall industrial market, we do expect sales, basically, to remain at current levels for the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, we maintain a very positive outlook for this important market, as our diversified range of leading-edge technology interconnect solutions continues to position us extremely well in a broad array of industrial segments.","The automotive market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter, and we're very pleased that sales increased very strongly, 25% from prior year and 2% sequentially, driven in particular by our participation in a range of new electronics in vehicles. We continue to realize the benefits of our dual strategic focus on both acquiring complementary companies in the automotive interconnect market while, at the same time, accelerating our internal new product developments.","In particular, we're making excellent progress at expanding organically into new higher-reliability and higher-technology applications in the car. This includes engine control, braking, electronics transmission and other new applications. In the fourth quarter, we expect sales to grow moderately from these already high levels. As automakers continue to integrate electronics into new areas of performance management, fuel efficiency and passenger infotainment, we believe that we'll continue to have excellent long-term growth opportunities in the automotive market.","The mobile devices market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. Sales decreased, as we expected, by 14% from prior year, driven primarily by a reduction in sales of products used in tablets. As we discussed last quarter, this lower tablet-related demand was a result really of 3 factors: first, a shift towards lower-content white box tablets; second, a faster-than-expected shift towards WiFi-only devices; and finally, lower unit sales than prior year on a range of higher-content new programs. Sales in the quarter did actually increase by 8% from the second quarter, which was a bit more than we had expected, as we realized growth, especially in products incorporated into new high-performance ultrabooks.","Looking forward, we expect sales in the mobile device market to grow slightly in the fourth quarter, as we benefit from increased demand for certain new programs being launched for the holiday season. Despite the challenging performance this year, we continue to have a positive long-term outlook for the ever-volatile mobile devices market, as our leading portfolio of products continue to create significant value for a wide range of device makers.","The mobile networks market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were slightly down from prior year and down 7% sequentially, as strength in our sales of products into cell site installations was offset by a moderation in sales to equipment manufacturers. While we believe the third quarter represented an expected seasonal pause in wireless equipment output, we are encouraged by the widely reported intentions of many operators around the world to increase their spending on LTE and other next-generation networks.","When those network build-outs will be implemented, however, is always difficult to predict. Nevertheless, we are well positioned when such construction ultimately takes place. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to remain at or slightly above these levels, as the moderation of build-outs in certain Western regions is offset by increasing activity that we're seeing in China. Our team continues to be very successful at expanding and upgrading our range of high-technology products for the mobile networks market, with the result that we are better positioned than ever before with a diverse set of wireless OEMs and operators around the globe.","The Information Technology and Data Communications market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter, and sales increased 7% from prior year and were up slightly from prior quarter. While the sales increase from prior year was driven especially by strength in products related to storage and server applications, we did also see growth in the important networking market. We're very encouraged to have continued to outperform the overall IT market again in this quarter, as our new design-ins of high-speed, and power products in particular, into next-generation Datacom systems have allowed us to grow despite what is an overall very muted IT spending environment.","As our customers continue to strive for new levels of equipment performance in order to handle a dramatic expansion of data traffic, our pipeline of new design opportunities with next-generation products continues to strengthen. We're working very intensively with many customers around the world to help them design new systems that can both manage the big data revolution, as well as the tremendous expansion of video traffic that their end customers are experiencing, all while reducing power consumption. Although we expect a slight moderation in demand in the fourth quarter tied to recently curtailed demand expectations from certain IT customers, we continue to have a very positive long-term outlook as we realize the benefits of our range of new products designed into next-generation equipment.","The broadband market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased a very strong 24% from prior year as we were able to gain further leverage from last year's Holland acquisition. Sequentially, our sales in the broadband market decreased slightly on decreased North American MSO spending, in particular on bulk cable. While we expect a moderation of sales in the fourth quarter on traditional seasonality, we are very encouraged to see the emerging benefits of our product and customer diversification. These diversification efforts have enabled us to strengthen our future position by growing our range of broadband customers beyond traditional MSOs while, at the same time, offering a more complete interconnect product offering.","So to summarize the third quarter, I can just say that I'm extremely proud of the Amphenol organization, as we continue to execute well in what is no doubt a very challenging and extremely dynamic market environment. Our superior performance is a clear reflection of the company's distinct competitive advantages: leading technology, our increasing position with customers across a diverse range of end markets; a worldwide presence that continues to expand; a lean and very flexible cost structure; and most importantly, an agile entrepreneurial management team, who continually react quickly to all the changes that we see in the marketplace.","Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. There continues to be a significant volatility in the global economy, which is certainly not being helped by the widely reported political and fiscal issues in the U.S. and other geographies. With this in mind and based on constant exchange rates and normal seasonal patterns, we now expect in the fourth quarter and full year 2013 the following results. We expect sales in the range of $1,146,000,000 to $1,171,000,000 and $4,515,000,000 to $4,540,000,000, respectively. And we expect earnings per share in the range of $0.96 to $0.99 and $3.76 to $3.79, respectively. For the full year, these results represent sales and EPS growth of 5% to 6% and 8% to 9%, respectively.","Let me just finish by saying that we continue to see tremendous opportunities for our company as a result of the ongoing revolution in electronics, and I remain very confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to continue to capitalize on these opportunities, both to grow our market position and expand our profitability and, ultimately, to thereby drive the continued superior performance for Amphenol.","Thank you very much, and operator, at this time, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there might be.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just maybe starting off on the defense side, Adam. I realize the uncertainties that you'd outlined. But I'm curious, given the debt ceiling and the budget resolution yesterday or today morning, does that make you think that December quarter could end up being a bit better, given your customers potentially have better visibility, at least for the next 90 days?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes. Amit, thank you so much for the question. I wish the 90 days counted as visibility. Let me just say -- I mean, yes, there was a resolution yesterday, and certainly, we're cognizant of that. But this was really just a kicking of the can. And I think that our customers, in the defense market in particular, there really is no clear direction about what's going to happen with sequestration. There's no clear direction what's going to happen come January 15 or February 15 or whichever next deadline is going to appear, and I wouldn't really say that there is a healthy optimism that anything will happen, except more brinksmanship in the government. But that's beyond the scope, certainly, of this discussion. I think we have a very strong outlook, given all of this. We expect the sales in the military market to increase sequentially into the fourth quarter, and as I've said, that's largely because of, in addition to normal seasonality, the programs that we've been working on, the new programs with customers. And I think our mission is really not to guess where the government is going to go, but to continue to drive the new technologies that our customers continue to have a tremendous, tremendous requirement for.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Fair enough. And if I could just follow up on your capital allocation going forward. I think Diana, you talked about having close to $1.3 billion of cash and investments on hand today. I'm just -- how much cash do you think you need to run on a steady-state basis? And I'm sure you guys want to keep doing acquisitions, but should we start to think about 1 million to 1.5 million shares being bought back quarterly as more steady-state as you go forward? I guess I want to think about, should we start thinking of share count reduction of 4 million, 5 million a year as part of Amphenol's long-term capital allocation strategy?","Diana G. Reardon","Sure. As you point out, we certainly have significant capacity, both from a cash perspective, from an availability perspective, I think over $2 billion at the end of the quarter. We also have tremendous ability to generate operating cash flow. And I think, historically, we've used about half of that operating cash flow for the acquisition program and the other half has gone back to shareholders. From a prioritization standpoint, we continue to believe that the acquisition program is the best use of that capacity, and I know, sometimes, that requires some patience relative to the use of cash on hand and that kind of thing, just to make sure that one has the ability to execute when opportunities come to pass. That being said, I think, over the last few years, we've certainly had a pretty consistent flow and balance to the use of the cash, and I think that we have fairly consistently been buying stock back for the last few years. I think that we do believe balance is important, and I think you'll continue to see us have a balanced approach in the future. I think the only caveat to that would be the case where we did have an opportunity from an acquisition standpoint to deploy more of our resources towards that. And I think for the right opportunity, we would think that, that would be the right thing to do for the company.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Adam, wanted to just ask a question regarding the mobility business. Obviously, you got some headwinds there, both in terms of unit slowdown as -- and in addition to the connector content, with the proliferation of WiFi-only devices. As you look at that opportunity going into next year, do you see that trend continuing? And how are you looking at that in terms of your market share within that business and trying to grow it now against some of those headwinds?","R. Adam Norwitt","Matt, thank you very much for the question. Obviously, we spoke extensively last quarter about the mobile devices market and the various changes that we saw, and I think we're very happy to see that, in this quarter, that market actually performed a little bit better than we had expected. I think that our position and our share remains extremely strong in that market. We have a tremendous position. But as we discussed last quarter, we did see the shift towards WiFi-only devices as one of the components of a change in our guidance. And I think, going forward, that is really kind of a onetime shift, because there is now a very high proportion of those devices which are essentially WiFi-only, a very small proportion, conversely, which are being sold with 3G or LTE access. And because of that, we wouldn't expect that to be a continual drag. All that being said, it's a very dynamic market, and we've never hid the fact that, that is a market where constantly there is change. And so we're not prepared today to give guidance in that market, certainly for next year, but we continue to have a very strong position. We continue to see a lot of opportunities with customers who are designing and developing innovative new devices, where our products can create value for them. And once again, I'll just remind everybody of our strategy there, which is, very clearly, we participate in that market where we can create value for our customers and thereby, earn the return for Amphenol. We've been very successful doing that through many, many cycles, with many different leaders and many different types of products that have come out, and we're confident for the future that, that will still be the case.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Adam, I was curious about your commentary with respect to the volatility in the environment. I was just curious, was much of this exasperated as the quarter went on. And as we saw some of the shenanigans out of D.C., would you say it was tepid across the environment,, independent of what happened in D.C.? I'm just trying to get a sense of just sort of the macro environment in other geographies and whether it was relatively volatile throughout the quarter, whether you saw some things that have accelerated towards the tail end.","R. Adam Norwitt","I would definitely tell you that if we look at orders for the quarter, and we did have a slightly negative book to bill, which we -- would not be the case in most Q3s, that, clearly, as the quarter went on, the hesitancy in certain -- in customers in certain markets, and in particular, I would say, industrial and military, which tend to be more broadly impacted by things like government spending and budget, certainly, we saw increasing levels of conservatism and hesitancy on the part of those customers as the quarter went on. How that will trend going into this month, what will be the impact of the various news items that we read about today, it's hard to say. But clearly, as that got closer, there was certainly an increased level of wariness by customers.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And any additional insight just in terms of geographic trends, Asia Pac, Europe and North America?","R. Adam Norwitt","No. I mean, look, this -- clearly, in the month of September and October, the big story in the world has been the U.S. budget discussions. There -- it doesn't mean that the rest of the world is kind of smooth sailing. So I think -- but we haven't seen anything beyond that, that's so different, except for the kind of knock-on effects around the world in terms of people not being so confident if the world's largest economy can't pass the budget.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Wood with Macquarie.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","A lot of positive content trends benefiting Amphenol. But in terms of the mobile device segment, with both smartphones and tablets, if we do have this longer-term shift that typically occurs in these electronics towards lower-priced products, how does Amphenol change its positioning? Or do you need to kind of accommodate that price erosion that occurs?","R. Adam Norwitt","Thanks very much for the question, Mike. Look, I think we have seen many times over the course of our long-term participation in this market, that there has been a cycle of maturation, commoditization and innovation across the mobile devices market, and I would not expect that to change. The fact is, if you go back 2, 3 years ago -- say, 3 years ago, we never would have anticipated that there was even a thing called a tablet computer that would drive growth for us. What will be the next device? What will be the next innovation that comes out of our customers? Very hard to predict. Will we be positioned with those customers? That, we have a lot of confidence in. Will there be more innovations? That, as well, history has shown there are always innovations on the horizon that will come, and no doubt about it, we are working with customers on new devices around the world. It's clear that our performance this quarter was certainly impacted by change in tablets. When we look at the sequential growth that we had between the third quarter and the second quarter, in fact, a lot of that was driven by new higher-performance, higher-functionality ultrabooks. And so what will be the next thing? It's hard to predict. But again, we feel very comfortable and confident in our position to be there to enable that next-generation device to come, when it does indeed come.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","And in terms of the uncertainty on timing of the network build-out that you've mentioned with the WiFi, what trends are you seeing from customers? How long of a lead time will you get from design work or early-stage order insight?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes. I mean, in terms of the network, I guess you're referring here to the mobile networks market and the kind of uncertainty around when that spending will come. And we work both with operators and OEMs, and they have different kinds of lead times. Sometimes, the OEMs will start to build in advance, and we saw even a little bit of that for China 3G, as OEMs start to build in anticipation, really, of awards that are coming. But the reality is, is the operators, there's a lot of factors that drives, ultimately, when they put towers up and when they install equipment. Even in North America -- I mean one thing that we have heard is one of the real bottlenecks in North America to install mobile networks is, believe it or not, availability of work crews, qualified, certified work crews to put up sufficient towers, and that has actually constrained the build-out for certain operators here in North America. I think early in the first half of the year, there was a fair amount of strength coming out of North America with the LTE build from several of the large operators. I think there will be a little bit more strength in Asia in the second half, and maybe a little bit less from North America. And I think that will balance out. But by and large, we feel that we have a great position in that market, and just to reiterate, that is a position that is both on the equipment, as well as direct with the operators on the interconnect and antenna accessories that go onto the towers. So to the extent that those build-outs happen in the traditionally unpredictable fashion that they do, we'll be very well positioned to participate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just wanted to ask a little bit about the growth expectations. Looking at your guidance, it looks like, at the midpoint, you're expecting revenue to be up about 1% sequentially. Usually, you're up about 3% to 4%. And just looking through the commentary, I'm trying to understand, is that slower growth? I know you commented on the different sort of volatility in the end markets, but is that primarily related to mobile devices, the way that you see it?","Diana G. Reardon","I think the sequential increase in mobile devices this year, both in Q3 and Q4 certainly, is a lot less than what one would normally expect, and less than what we've seen historically. So I think that probably would be one of the biggest factors in that comparison.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just also thinking about your growth, I think you said at the beginning of the call, organic growth this year on a year-over-year basis was about flat. I'm just curious what you think the market's growing at. And do you think you're able to get back to sort of your more historical growth rates going forward?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes. I think -- what the market ends up growing, we're one of the earliest to release our results here, and we will certainly see. But if we look back over the course of this year, we have clearly outperformed the market going forward in this year, and we have every expectation that our company continues to perform really at the leading edge of the interconnect market. I think the overall economy and the overall market and if you look at -- as it's reflected with a lot of the customers that we work with, there really has not been a tremendous amount of growth, and there doesn't appear to be a tremendous amount of growth going here into the third quarter. All that being said, we do have one of our segments, mobile devices, which is down sort of an abnormal amount this quarter. So we'll see, ultimately, where that works out. But we still feel very comfortable and confident that we continue to have, really, a strong industry-leading growth position. Where does it go long term? Sherri, I mean we're not going to give guidance right now for next year, but we continue to see tremendous growth opportunities for the company and for the industry. The expansion and, really, proliferation of electronics across all the markets that we see continues to have tremendous, tremendous potential. It really depends, obviously, what is the overall macro environment. We have been here for a couple of years in a real kind of a halting recovery, if you will, one which doesn't seem to gain real traction. And I think if that can really turn around a little bit, I believe that the opportunity for growth in the electronics, in the interconnect industry, and our opportunity within that industry has really a lot of potential going forward and for the long term. And we're very committed to continuing to have that industry leadership that we have had for so many years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Firstly, I don't mean to nitpick on this thing, but you guys usually don't call out acquisition-related charges, so maybe you could just tell me why this was a little bit abnormal. Or is this something we should expect going forward? And then, second, I don't think this was covered, and I apologize if it was, but within the IT, Datacom space, I think, Adam, you cited just a weakness with customers. And I wanted to know if that was more tied to, whether it's market weakness, product weakness, company-specific or client-specific weakness. Just kind of what's driving maybe what's a little bit of an abnormal weakness in that sector for the fourth quarter?","Diana G. Reardon","Sure. We actually have called out acquisition-related charges for the last few years. So we had $2 million in the fourth quarter last year and I think $2 million in -- I forget which quarter, it might have been the fourth quarter of the year before. So I think, as you probably recall, the accounting rules changed, and I'm going to get my years wrong here, but I think maybe 3, 4 years ago, such that transaction-related expenses no longer went into goodwill or the basis of the company, and they just are P&L expense now. So we did, at that point, start to break them out because they're not normal operating costs. And from an operating management perspective, these are not costs that relate to the current activity. So we've been pretty consistent breaking them out for the last few years.","R. Adam Norwitt","Shawn, and relative to the IT, Datacom commentary, you're right. I did talk about that we've seen some moderation, especially later in the third quarter, in terms of demand outlook. And I tend to think that, that has a lot to do with the overall macro economy. I mean, I think Diana mentioned that the industrial, military and then also the IT market are markets that do tend to have some more tied industry[ph] relationship to overall economic uncertainty. And what we've seen there is really not specific necessarily to one or another customer, but more just an overall sense of a moderation, and I think that there have been a couple of earnings releases over the last 24 hours which seem to certainly confirm that, that is not a frothy environment. And I think when we look at our performance, looking backwards compared to last year, it's extremely strong performance compared -- really, on any comparable basis, and we feel that we continue to make real incremental progress in this market. And if I look back over the course of this year, we have had just strong growth performance in the IT market, I mean, on a year-to-date basis, really growing stronger than virtually anybody who has released their results in terms of OEMs. And that really comes from what I said. It is the drive of new products that are essentially enabling our customers to do battle in a very difficult environment, where they got to sell on functionality and deal with data rates which are expanding dramatically, but IT budgets which are essentially flat. And if you can enable a customer to really offer the proverbial better mousetrap at the same price, whether that is ability to process more data or ability to use less power, that can be a very, very compelling selling proposition to our customers, and that's really why we believe our position continues to strengthen there. Looking into the fourth quarter, again, I think there is just some degree of conservatism by customers in light of the more broad economic uncertainty that's there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My question probably is good for both, Adam, on the strategy side, and maybe, Diana, to help us understand the financials a little bit. I find the acquisition today very interesting, that you announced, Ionix Systems. It looks like, from looking at their profile on the web, that they do a lot of cables and harnesses, and I didn't see much mention about connectors. So maybe I just misread it or whatever. But can you let us know, is it truly more of a cable harness company and strategically, that's something that Amphenol is looking at? I mean there's a lot of harness companies out there, aerospace, industrial, automotive. Are we looking at a bit of a shift to include that now in your profile? And then, Diana, on the financials side, I'm not familiar with harness making in cables. Is that similar to Amphenol's profitability, margins and outflows and cost of goods sold or returns of capital and capital deployment? If you could just kind of walk us through the strategy and financials of that.","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes. Jim, thank you very much for the question. We're very pleased with this acquisition. And let me just say that we actually make a lot of cable assemblies in Amphenol, and we always have. And we have made cable assembly acquisitions. Even the one that we made earlier this year, DC Electronics, was a cable assembly -- high-performance, harsh-environment cable assemblies for the industrial market. Ionix is high-performance, harsh-environment cable assemblies for the aerospace market, and in particular, they have a very strong position in aircraft engines, but just tremendous performance capabilities in their assemblies. And we have expectations of all the companies in Amphenol, whether they make components or cable assemblies or whatever, that they have the opportunity to make the margins that we make in the company, and there's not something de facto which says that, that can be a lower margin. You referred to harnesses, and there is a whole world that is called harnessing and -- the automotive harnessing world, for example, or the big aircraft harnessing. These are the long kind of trunk harnesses, and that is not what we are getting into here. I mean, traditionally -- the implication of your question is correct, that harnessing tends to be a lower value-add and thus, ultimately, a high-material, low-margin business. That's not what we're getting into here. We're getting into cable assemblies that are high performance, harsh environment, ruggedized. They have a tremendous amount of content capability -- content opportunity for Amphenol products as well, and it is really right up our alley in Amphenol, of the strategy that we have been pursuing for a very long time, to expand the breadth of product offering that we can support customers in that important commercial aerospace market.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And Diana, financial views?","Diana G. Reardon","I don't know that I would have a lot to add to what Adam just said. I think, as he said, we have a large portion of our existing business which are various types of value-added product. I mean, from our perspective, the profitability potential of a business has a lot more to do with the technology that one brings and the strength of the management team. And I think this business has excellent technology. It has a very committed and effective management team, and we're very excited to have it as part of the company. And we believe it has great potential and should perform the same as you see the rest of our company performing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Brian John White - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Just on the mobile device segment heading into the December quarter, what area do you expect to outperform? It doesn't sound like ultrabooks are doing that great. So do we think smartphones or tablets are going to outperform?","R. Adam Norwitt","Look, I mean, actually, what we saw in the third quarter was actually that our sales of products on the ultrabooks were really a strong driver of what was a higher-than-expected sequential growth into the third quarter. What that will be going into the fourth quarter remains to be seen. Again, it is not the easiest market to predict, but we still see continued strength in ultrabooks. And I think the broad range of products that we have really, we see, on a sequential basis, helping to drive what we don't expect to be an enormous uplift into the fourth quarter, but we do expect to see some moderate degree of growth.","Brian John White - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. Wearable devices, are you seeing any programs around wearable devices that Amphenol will participate?","R. Adam Norwitt","Gosh, I remember we made our first connector on a smart watch about 11 years ago. I remember wearing the first prototype of that. I don't know. I mean, look, we don't talk about specific devices with specific customers. Obviously, when something is super small, the opportunity for content in such a thing would be less than something that is a bit bigger and has more functionality to it. But certainty, to the extent that there's interconnect and antennas involved and that does create value inside a wearable device, I'm sure that, that could be something that would be an opportunity for Amphenol. But will that be a huge driver? I think too early to say what, ultimately, a wearable device looks like and what the architecture underlying that thing will be.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was hoping you could talk a little bit on the margins, the strong performance at 19.7% EBIT margin in the last couple of quarters, which is the highest level since the first quarter of 2011. And as you guys look forward, do you expect drop-through to operating income to mirror historical rates? Or are there other things that might be impacting that, potentially on the positive side, such as commodity prices?","Diana G. Reardon","Sure. I think, as a company, we have a goal, and we talk about conversion margins or how much incremental income does one get on incremental sales. And the goal that the company has is to target 25% conversion margins, which would imply that, as a management team, we continue to work to increase the overall profitability of the company. As -- ROS at this point, as you've pointed out, stands at 19.7%. I think that there are a lot of things that go into that. Certainly, participation in the high-technology end of the markets that we're involved in and very strong operations management and execution of the whole team are, I would say, 2 of the most important factors. I think that certainly having a normal commodity environment or a balance between input costs and pricing dynamics is something that also is important in being able to achieve these high profitability levels. I think that the higher the profitability of the business becomes, obviously, the harder it is to get those incremental ROS levels. But this team has a great track record. We've had a very strong performance this year. I think we have good guidance going into the remainder of the year, and we're still very confident in that 25% conversion margin goal.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","For my follow-up, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more on the cable business. I know, traditionally, pricing has been very difficult there. But now that you've expanded your portfolio with some of the acquisitions, are you able to do things, just selling an entire solution to maybe offset some of the traditional pricing pressure?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes. No, this is a very nice question, Mark. I -- one would hope. But let me tell you that, ultimately, customers, when they buy cable, they certainly push for a price for that cable, and it really depends on the behavior of competition. And I think we've talked about that this year, we haven't seen the most disciplined behavior this year on the Cable Products. I think the better benefit really comes as we broaden the range of these different products, the variety of interconnect and value-add products that we have really been able to build out, together with the acquisition that we made of Holland. That gives us really higher value to those customers because we're creating higher-technology solutions for them. We're helping them to solve a lot of real challenges that come in the cable, the satellite and the telco area of TV and high-speed data delivery. Because as LTE has come out, that has created new problems, interferences and other things. As you get these new systems, you create just a lot of complexity over the type -- the standards of the different data that is really flowing into the house. And if you can help the customer solve those problems, then they're very happy to come to you. And ultimately, there is -- I believe, can be a benefit of that kitting. But it's got to be really over time, as the customers realize that the value is coming from those new high-technology interconnect products that we're presenting them with. So I think, long term, there can be a benefit. I can't say that, short term, we have seen real pricing benefit on the bulk cable, but we have certainly seen an enhancement to our margins from the generation of these higher-value, higher-margin interconnect components.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Kisner with Jefferies LLC.","James M. Kisner - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I guess I just wanted to talk about your acquisition strategy. Just in general, could you update us on how the pipeline of acquisition targets looks right now, I guess, even relative to 6 months to a year ago? And then, separately, just given the acquisition of Molex by Koch Industries, is it possible that you could see incremental competition in your bids for new targets, just given that there's deeper pockets there and that company has sort of the history of being acquisitive once they bought a company?","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure. James, thanks very much for the question. I think relative to our pipeline, we have a very strong pipeline. It is a real part of the Amphenol operating culture and the regimen that we follow to really drive acquisitions and to drive that pipeline, just as we drive the organic growth of the company. And I think that results in us being able to uncover and incubate a lot of interesting companies that may not otherwise rise to the surface to our competition. So we feel very good about the pipeline, and whether it's incrementally good over the last 6 months, I mean, that's always hard to judge. But it is a very strong pipeline. Relative to the acquisition of Molex by Koch, certainly, we congratulate the family and the management team of Molex. This is obviously a very nice resolution for all of them. Does that make a new competitor in the market for acquisitions? Molex has been an acquisitive company before. The management team was always very focused on this, and I don't think that, that necessarily creates big changes in our market. If it did change their appetite, we have been very successful over years when there were others who are out there making acquisitions without regard to price, and we still made tremendous numbers of very, very strong acquisitions. And the beauty of the interconnect market is it is a constant wellspring of innovation, just like technology is. And with that wellspring of innovation, it creates as well a wellspring of new companies that come about, new companies that you never knew of before or existing companies who have now grown and reached new levels of performance that make them, thereby, attractive as an acquisition. And I think that, that just sort of spring of acquisitions that is there, so to speak, I think that has not shown any signs, in my mind, of abating. And to the extent that there is, with Molex, a different appetite for acquisitions, I think there's going to be plenty of nice companies for all of us to buy. All that being said, I would also just bring your attention to the fact that, at Amphenol, we have such a tremendous track record. We have acquired more than 50 companies over the last decade, and we have a very unique organizational structure, a culture and a structure which is really having as its nucleus entrepreneurial general managers who run businesses. Well, if you're an entrepreneur seeking to sell your company and you want to choose, ultimately, who do you sell that to, obviously, you can just use the highest price. But I can tell you that, that's not always the only determinant. And you want to also choose a company where you can join and where what you have built as an entrepreneur can really be perpetuated, can be enhanced, can be built upon. And it's our organizational structure that creates that tremendous, tremendous welcoming environment to these entrepreneurs. And so I think that we -- even if it is a more competitive environment, yes or no, that may be, we still will have a very, very strong position as -- what I believe, as the industry's acquirer of choice.","Operator","Next question is from William Stein with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I hope not to beat the M&A horse, but I do have another question about it. The way I see the acquisition that you announced today, it sounds highly consistent with prior deals, both from a technology perspective and the sizing, certainly not unusual. But 2 questions about the M&A pipeline. Understanding the timing of deals is highly unpredictable, I wonder if you can characterize whether there are any significant deals, any outsized deals in the pipeline. And also, anything that would kind of take you away from your traditional technology envelope? And then I do have a follow-up, if I can.","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure. I think that -- nice to hear your voice again, Will, first of all. I'll tell you that timing is impossible to predict, and we never do try to predict it. We never forecast acquisitions and -- nor do we really comment about near-term acquisitions. I'll just tell you that we have a good pipeline of a wide variety of companies, and I'll kind of leave it at that. Relative to traditional products and our expansion as a company into other segments, I'll just tell you that for a long time, we have always been sensitive to where technology is moving in our industry and have made acquisitions that, at the time, may be somewhat ancillary to our core products, but really, were one of -- one and the same as a total solution. I remember, a dozen years ago or more, when we made our first acquisition into antennas. And antennas, at the time, certainly had a different word for it than connector, but we viewed an antenna as really an extension of the interconnect system. And I think there are other things that are out there that we would view, in addition, positively, as something where there is technology that is embedded in it, where it's consistent with our approach to our customers, and we would certainly not shy away from considering some of those things, so long as they fit with our financial criteria and we really view them as part of that system, that interconnect system and the relationship that we have with our customers from that technology standpoint. But again, we are always open-minded about this, and we are very, very good at executing upon that with our lean team here in the headquarters.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Appreciate that helpful answer. A follow-up, if I can. I wonder if you can characterize the results and the outlook in terms of geographic and channel strengths and weaknesses.","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes. I mean, I think, geographically, not surprisingly, when you have strong performance in automotive and Commercial Air, Europe was not so bad for us. I think Europe was a strong growing market for us. Because Commercial Air tends to be either Europe or North America and automotive, for us at least, tends to be more of a European business. I think that on a sequential basis, we had strong -- we had some growth in mobile devices, that tends to be more Asian-related. So I think it's not surprising, and I don't know that there's anything that's more of a regional macroeconomic trend as much as it is that the strength in the various end markets that we have tends to have some impact on those regions. In terms of the guidance, I wouldn't say anything really different from that. I think it would be largely consistent with our market guidance that I've given.","Operator","Our final question today comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research.","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","So Adam, I guess the first question should be whether you have that smart watch still, but I'll skip that one. So just 2 real quick questions. Just, first of all, on the guidance, Diana, it seems like you're assuming less-than-typical conversion margins. I don't know if there's any cost pressures that need to be called out for Q4 we should think about. And then, secondly, just looking at where your net-debt-to-cap is right now. I mean, 27% is relatively low for the company. I think, prerecession, you were in the 30s, which is pretty significant sort of lower capital structure. Is there anything -- I know you don't like to provide targets around that, but is there anything that will prevent you from sort of heading back up towards the mid-30s if you saw the right opportunity for shareholders?","Diana G. Reardon","Let me just answer the last question first. I mean, no, I think that the capacity of the company from a leverage perspective certainly is very much a function of the company's ability to generate very strong operating cash flow. And so, certainly for the right opportunity, one could adjust the structure, and this would be not any sort of an issue whatsoever from an operational perspective. I think the one caveat we would put around that, I think that the investment-grade rating is something that the company feels is important, but even that being said, there's a lot of capacity within that rating. So I think for the right opportunity, as you said, certainly, that is something we would consider. From a profitability perspective, I guess, as far as we look at the fourth quarter, the conversion margins that we would see in the fourth quarter are about consistent with what they've been so far this year, kind of in that 23% kind of range. So I think that we would look, on an annual basis, to close at about 23% year-over-year conversion margins, which we feel is good performance against our 25% goal. If you're looking maybe at a -- from a net earnings perspective, the tax rate in Q4 is slightly higher than in Q3, so I don't know if that maybe somehow impacted the math. But I think from an ROS perspective, the guidance is very consistent with how we have historically performed.","R. Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much, Steve. And I noticed, on my analog windup watch here, that we have really reached the top of the hour. And I'd like to extend my appreciation to all of you for joining our call this quarter, and wish you all a successful completion to 2013. And we certainly look forward to speaking to you all next year, when we talk about the fourth quarter. Thank you very much.","Diana G.

Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Craig Lampo and I am Amphenol\u2019s CFO. I am here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO.","We would like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter conference call. Q4 and full year 2016 results were released this morning and I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter and full year and Adam will give an overview of the business, current trends and then we\u2019ll have Q&A. We may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. Please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information.","The company closed the fourth quarter with sales of $1.651 billion and diluted EPS of $0.75 meeting the high end of the company's guidance and achieving new records of performance in both sales and EPS. Sales were up 15% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. From an organic standpoint and excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the fourth quarter increased 4%. Sequentially sales were up 1% in U.S. dollars and organically and 2% in local currency.","Breaking down sales into our two segments, our cable business, which comprised 6% of our sales was up 18% from the fourth quarter last year with organic growth as well as the impact of acquisitions. The interconnect business which comprise 94% of our sales was up 15% from last year with organic growth as well as the impact of FCI as well as other acquisitions. For the full year 2016 sales were record $6.286 billion, up 13% in U.S. dollars, 14% in local currency and 2% organically compared to 2016. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.","Operating income was $339 million for the fourth quarter, operating margin was a record 20.5% in the fourth quarter of \u201816 compared to 20.2% in the fourth quarter of last year and up 20 basis points from the third quarter of \u201816 adjusted operating margin of 20.3%.","From a segment standpoint in the cable segment margins remain flat at 14.9% compared to last quarter and improved from 12.5% last year. The increase in margins from last year related primarily to strong operating execution on the additional volume, as well as the benefit from favorable impact of commodities.","In the interconnect segment, margins were unchanged compared to last year at 22.4% and represented a slight increase over the last quarter of 22.2%, reflecting excellent operating execution throughout the business and a very successful first year of improving performance for FCI, the largest acquisition in the history of the company.","We continue to be very pleased with the company\u2019s operating margin achievement both with the full year achievement of 19.8% on an adjusted basis, which reflects the impact of the lower then average profitability level of FCI in the first half and in particular with the consistent quarterly improvement in profitability throughout 2016, culminating in the achievement of 20.5% operating margin in the fourth quarter.","This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company\u2019s entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high performance, action oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment.","Through the careful fostering for such a culture and the deployment of these strategies to both existing and acquired companies our management team has achieved industry leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhance performance in the future. Interest expense for the quarter was $18 million compared to $17 million last year, reflecting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the company\u2019s stock buyback programs.","The company\u2019s effective tax rate was 26.5% for the fourth quarter of \u201816 and \u201815. For the full year the adjusted effective tax rate was 26.5% in both 2016 and 2015. On a GAAP basis the company\u2019s full year effective tax rate was 27.0% and 26.6% for 2016 and \u201815 respectively, reflecting the tax impact of the acquisition related cost incurred during the respective years.","Net income was a strong 14% of sales in the fourth quarter of \u201816. Diluted EPS grew 19% to $0.75 in the fourth quarter of \u201916 from $0.63 in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year 2016 adjusted diluted EPS was $2.72, up 12% over 2015 at $2.43, a very strong performance. On a GAAP basis diluted EPS was $2.61 and $2.41 for the full year of 2016 and 2015 respectively.","Orders for the quarter were at $1.669 billion, a 14% increase over the fourth quarter of last year, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.01:1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was a record $349 million in the fourth quarter or approximately 146% of net income. And for the full year operating cash flow was also a record $1.78 billion or approximately 129% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income.","From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $929 million at the end of the year. Inventory days were 76, down three days compared to December of last year. Accounts receivable was approximately $1.3 billion at the end of December and day sales outstanding was 73 days, up approximately two days from December of 2015. Accounts payable was $678 million at the end of the year and payable days was 55, up approximately one day compared to December of last year.","The cash flow from operations of $349 million in the quarter, along with commercial paper borrowings of $37 million and stock option proceeds of $38 million were used primarily to purchase approximately $96 million of the company\u2019s stock, to fund net capital expenditures of $51 million, to fund dividend payments of $43 million, and to fund acquisitions of approximately $32 million, which resulted in an increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $181 million net of translation.","During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.5 million shares, completing our January 2015 stock repurchased plan of 10 million shares. The company\u2019s Board of Directors has authorized it\u2019s a new two year stock repurchase program, to repurchase up to $1 billion of the company\u2019s common stock commencing in January of 2017.","At December 31st, cash and short-term investments were $1.2 billion and the majority of which is held outside the U.S. At year-end the company had issued $1 billion under its commercial paper program and the company\u2019s cash and availability under our credit facilities totaled approximately $2.2 billion at December 31st.","Total debt at December 31st was approximately $3 billion and net debt was approximately $1.8 billion. And the fourth quarter 2016 EBITDA was approximately $403 million, bringing full year EBITDA to $1.465 billion. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter and a strong finish to a great year.","Before I turn the call over to Adam, I wanted to make a couple of comments relative to our sales guidance for the first quarter and full year \u201817. Our guidance reflects an organic growth rate excluding all acquisitions and currency impacts of 1% to 4% in the first quarter of \u201817 and 1% to 3% for the full year of 2017. In addition the guidance reflects the benefit of our recently announced acquisitions, as well as offsetting native effects of current FX rates versus 2016, particularly the weakening of euro, renminbi and the pound. This results in a U.S. dollar growth rate of 3% to 6% for the first quarter of \u201817 and 1% to 3% for the full year of 2017.","Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends.","Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much, Craig. And I would like to add my welcome to all of you on the phone and particularly like to wish you all a Happy New Year. As Craig mentioned, I am going to highlight some of our achievements in the fourth quarter, as well as for the full year 2016 and most importantly I\u2019ll walk you through the progress across our various served markets. Then finally I will take a few moments to comment on our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2017 and as Craig mentioned we will have time for questions at the end.","Our results in the fourth quarter were stronger than we had expected, as Craig mentioned we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and earnings and we reached new records in sales, EPS and operating margins.","Our sales in the quarter grew 15% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currencies and that reached a new record in the quarter of $1.651 billion. Craig alluded to the orders which were very robust nearly $1.669 billion and that was a book-to-bill of 1.01 to 1. In particularly we\u2019re very pleased with the profitability in the quarter and that new high of 20.5% certainly represents a great achievement for the company.","Cash flow is very strong in the quarter, $349 million and I think all of these results really confirm the company\u2019s financial strength. I can just say as we end the fourth quarter how proud I am of our team. Our results in the quarter once again reflect the true value of both the discipline and the agility of this entrepreneurial Amphenol organization. Who has continued to perform very well despite the many dynamics in the worldwide economy and all while driving outstanding operating performance for the company.","We are very pleased in the quarter that we closed on another outstanding acquisition, just recently in last couple of weeks during January. Phitek Systems Limited, it\u2019s a New Zealand base provider of high technology interconnects solutions that are used in in-flight entertainment and passenger connectivity for the commercial air market. Phitek has annual sales of approximately $20 million.","One thing, we are really excited about with Phitek is that they develop their products together with in-flight equipment manufacturers and aeroplane builders, but also directly with airlines around the world and that represents an outstanding complement to Amphenol\u2019s already broad array of products for commercial air applications.","We are really excited to welcome this outstanding new team to Amphenol and with that acquisition we remain very confident that our overall acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. It is really our ability to identify and execute upon acquisition opportunities while successfully bringing them into Amphenol that remains a core competitive advantage for the company.","Now, 2016 as a full year I think was just really outstanding year for the company, we expanded our position in the overall market growing sales by 13% in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currencies, reaching new sales record of $6.286 billion. Our full year adjusted operating margins reached 19.8%, which was an excellent achievement given the initially lower margins of FCI, which as you know we acquired back in the early part of January 2016. And that strong profitability enabled us to generate EPS in the year on an adjusted basis of $2.72, which grew 12% from prior year.","Our acquisition program in 2016 contributed significantly to our performance. First and foremost we closed on the largest acquisition in our history FCI. We're extremely pleased with the results of FCI in their first year as part of the Amphenol family. In fact, what I\u2019m most pleased about is how the FCI team has truly embraced Amphenol's performance culture and thereby has been able to drive outstanding improvements in their operating performance, And that has resulted in a contribution of $0.19 per share to EPS in 2016, well in excess of our original expectations, which you may recall back in January we expected about $0.12 of accretion for the company.","In addition to this great operating performance FCI has also solidified its position with customers across its many served markets and geographies. And in particular has made significant progress working collaboratively across Amphenol to expand our total company's collective technology and market strength.","In addition to the acquisition of FCI in 2016, you\u2019ll recall that we also acquired Auxel, Custom Cable, SGF Sensor Tech and All Systems Broadband as well as Phitek just here in January of 2017. These excellent acquisitions are already creating significant value for the company and really most importantly we've now been joined by a great range of talented individuals around the world with these companies. And that is really deepened our talent bench across an already impressive management team.","As we company think about the company long-term, our long-term mission remains to be the enabler of the electronics revolution. It's very simple mission and through the organic development efforts of Amphenol's entrepreneurial organization, together with the benefits of our acquisition program we've been able to expand our partnerships with the broadening array of customers across all of our diversified end markets. And this has ultimately resulted in Amphenol strengthening our position across the many segments of the electronics industry.","While the overall market environment in 2016 remained uncertain and there were no doubt many dynamics in the world. As we enter 2017 our management team is highly confident that we've build a platform of strength from which we can drive superior long-term performance.","Now turning to our trends across our served markets, I would just note at the beginning here that as we closed 2016 we're really proud of the company's balanced and broad market diversification. In fact even with the significant activity end of last year in our acquisition program, we're very pleased that no market this year exceeded 21% of our sales for the full year. And this diversification has really two great values; first it insulates us from individual market volatility.","But at the same time it also exposes us to the leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. And we think this really creates great long-term value for the company. We're also pleased that in 2016 many of our markets realized strong above industry organic growth rates.","So turning to the specific markets, the military market represented 10% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 9% of our sales for the full year. Sales were up strongly in the fourth quarter rising by a bit better than expected 14% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically. As we recovered from the earlier DLA stopped shipment while also capitalizing on stronger sales of products that go into communications, ordinance and military vehicle applications. Sequentially our sales increased by a very robust 12%.","For the full year of 2016, we're very pleased that despite the impact of DLA stopped shipment that was received in the first quarter, our military sales this year grew by 4% both in U.S. dollars and organically. And that just reflected strong organic performance in many segments of the market. I'm very proud of our military team as they have driven the strong performance in 2016, while also managing through what was no doubt a challenging regulatory issue.","In fact at the end of the day we have strengthened our overall market position through a long-term and consistent strategy of offering our customers the broadest range of leading technologies for their next generation equipment requirement. Looking ahead while we expect sales in the first quarter to moderate from these fourth quarter levels, we do anticipate achieving low to mid-single digit sales growth in the military market for the full year 2017.","The commercial aerospace market represented 4% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year. Sales in the fourth quarter were down from prior year by 5% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currencies as procurement and support of certain new airplane platforms did moderate from prior year. Sequentially our sales in the quarter were flat to the third quarter.","For the full year 2016 our sales were slightly down in U.S. dollars and flat in local currencies, as the impact from the DLA issue together with the continued moderation in demand for helicopters and business jets offset growth that was associated with new passenger airplane platforms.","We are really excited that the acquisition of Phitek broadened both our product offering as well as our customer relationships. We now have an excellent range of high technology interconnect solutions for the important area of passenger entertainment and comfort, together with these new direct relationships with airlines around the world.","Looking into 2017, we expect sales in the commercial air market to increase from these levels in the first quarter and for the full year we expect sales to increase in the mid to high single-digit as we benefit from the addition of Phitek while also realizing further organic growth from our strong position on new jet liner.","The industrial market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter and also 18% for the full year of 2016. Sales in this market grew by 22% in the fourth quarter in U.S. dollar and 3% organically as we benefited from the contributions from our acquisition, which included especially FCI, together with organic growth in the heavy equipment, factory automation, industrial instrumentation and medical markets. Sequentially our sales in the industrial market grew by a stronger than expected to 6% in the fourth quarter.","For the full year 2016, our sales grew by 20% in U.S. dollar and 2% organically, and this was driven by a benefit from our acquisition program, as well as strength in hybrid bus and truck, factory automation and heavy equipment, which were offset by still meaningful sales declines in oil and gas, as well as some moderation in the alternative energy applications.","We are very pleased with our progress in the diversified global industrial market. We now have a wider range of interconnect and sensor product across a broader array of exciting segment. In addition, we\u2019ve made further progress expanding into new areas of the industrial market both organically and through acquisition, including in particular with FCI\u2019s strong position in embedded computing. We look forward to realizing the benefits from these expansion efforts for many years in the future.","We anticipate sales in the first quarter to moderate slightly from these levels and for the full year 2017 we expect low to mid-single digit growth from the industrial market as we continue to benefit from our acquisitions, as well as our organic growth efforts.","The automotive market represented 18% of our sales in the fourth quarter as well as for the full year and sales increased very strong 14% in U.S. dollar, 16% in local currencies and 12% organically in the quarter. As we continue to make just great progress penetrating a wide array of applications and new electronic systems with car markers around the world. Sequentially our automotive sales increased by 3% in U.S. dollar and 5% in local currencies.","For the full year 2016, we grew by 12% in U.S. dollars and 8% organically, a clear reflection of the company\u2019s ongoing progress in expanding our position across the global automotive market. We\u2019re pleased in particular that we were able to grow organically in all regions around the world in 2016.","Our automotive business continues to benefit from the consistent strategy, which is very simply expanding our range of interconnect sensor and antenna products, both organically as well as through our acquisition program to enable a wide array of onboard electronics across a diversified range of vehicles made by auto manufactures around the world.","Looking into 2017, for the first quarter we expect sales to remain roughly at current levels, but for the full year we expect to achieve sales growth in the mid to high single-digit. We look forward to continuing to realize the benefits from our successful automotive business long into the future.","The mobile devices market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter and 14% for the full year. Our performance in the fourth quarter was a bit weaker than anticipated as sales were down by 27% from prior year and 19% sequentially. This significant moderation in demand resulted from slower sales in particular of products incorporated into tablets, smartphones as well production related accessories. Offset impart by increased sales of products used in new wearable technologies.","Once again I got to give a lot of credit to our team who demonstrated really impressive agility in the quarter as they were able to flex their resources quickly in the phase of this substantial sequential reduction in sales. For the full year 2016 our sales to the mobile device market declined by 15% from prior year with the largest reductions in tablet related products.","Despite this very challenging year in the very dynamic mobile devices market our team did a fantastic job in securing strong operating performance in the year, while at the same time positioning the company for the future through their development of exciting new interconnect and antenna products for a wide array of next generation mobile computing platforms.","As we look into this year and into the first quarter, we expect a sequential reduction in the first quarter of sales of approximately 20% due to the typical seasonality that we see in the market. And at this point for the full year 2017 we expect our sales to be flat from 2016. Without a doubt, though I can tell you that our team will remain poise to capitalize on any opportunities that may arise in the market to drive ultimately stronger performance in our mobile devices business.","The mobile networks market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter and as well 9% for the full year 2016. Sales grew from prior year by a stronger than expected 29% in U.S. dollars and 10% organically. This was due to contributions from the FCI acquisition, as well as our excellent organic progress in our sales to both OEMs and mobile network service providers. Sequentially our sales increased by 6% in what is almost always a seasonally softer fourth quarter that really reflects the great progress that we made in the market.","For the full year 2016 we achieved strong growth of 24% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically and that is despite a market that is no doubt remained very uncertain. We\u2019re very pleased that our long-term efforts to expand our high technology position with both mobile equipment manufacturers, as well as service providers around the world has paid real dividends here in 2016. And we look forward to continuing to capitalize on that strength in the future.","Looking ahead there remain significant uncertainty in the spending plans of wireless operators around the world and accordingly we expect our sales to moderate in the first quarter and for the full year 2017 we expect sales to remain roughly at 2016 levels. But even though we don\u2019t at this time expect the overall spending environment to improve our broaden product offering positions us better than ever before to capitalize on opportunities that will no doubt continue to arise in the long-term future.","The information technology and data communications market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter and 21% of our sales for the full year 2016. Sales are stronger than expected in the fourth quarter in IT datacom rising by a very significant 66% in U.S. dollars and 27% organically really an excellent performance by our team. Organically we grew really in all segments of the IT datacom market. So we\u2019re especially pleased with our accelerating progress of our sales into new web service providers, the sort of next generation customers.","Sequentially our sales increased by 3% from the third quarter. For the full year 2016 we\u2019re very excited to have achieved 45% growth in U.S. dollars and a very strong 11% growth organically in IT datacom. This organic growth is a real credit to our team\u2019s efforts to develop leading technologies, while rapidly pivoting towards opportunities for growth that are being created by the many new customers in the IT market.","Looking into 2017 while we do anticipate a normal seasonal moderation of sales in the first quarter, we expect to achieve mid-single digit sales growth for the full year 2017. I can tell you that both our traditional as well as our new customers in the IT datacom market continue to upgrade their data center equipment to reach new levels of performance and that performance is really necessary as they all seek to do with the rapid expansion of data traffic that\u2019s driven in particular by the continuing spread of IP video, as well as by the accelerating adoption of cloud based computing around the world.","Amidst this real dramatic technology shift we\u2019re really excited by our great progress in the IT market. With the acquisition of FCI together with the acquisition of FCI together with the other acquisitions we made this year such as Auxel and Custom Cable. We've significantly expanded our range of high speed, power, value add and other interconnect products for a broad array of applications in IT datacom. And we're now positioned stronger than ever in this very important market.","The broadband communications market represented 6% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 6% for the full year of 2016. Sales in this market were up 15% in U.S. dollars and up slightly organically in what is typically a seasonally softer fourth quarter. Sequentially our sales increased by 2% really with the contributions from All Systems Broadband that we completed in the third quarter.","So looking across the full year of 2016, we're very pleased with our performance. We grew 10% in U.S. dollars and 7% organically in broadband. And that reflected our further progress in diversifying our broadband product offering into new high technology value add interconnect solutions, while continuing to expand our positions with customers around the world.","For the first quarter we expect the slight increase of sales from the fourth quarter. And for the full year 2017 we look forward to achieving low double-digit growth as we benefit from our recent acquisition and also capitalize on our continued efforts to develop new products for broadband operators around the world.","So just to sum up our performance here in the fourth quarter in 2016, I can just simply say how proud I am of our performance and of our team. While there remain many dynamics in the global economy, the Amphenol organization has continued to execute extraordinarily well. In particular our dual pronged approach of growing both organically and through our acquisition program has resulted in Amphenol expanding our market position, while strengthening the company's financial performance.","The company's superior performance is really a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages. Our leading technology, our increasing position with a broad array of customers across diverse markets, our worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure, a highly effective acquisition program and most importantly our agile entrepreneurial management team.","Now turning to the outlook, based on the continuation of the current uncertain economic environment, as well as on constant exchange rates. We now expect for the first quarter and the full year 2017 the following results. For the first quarter we expect sales in the range of $1.495 billion to $1.535 billion and diluted EPS in the range of $0.65 to $0.67 respectively. This represents a sales increase versus prior year of 3% to 6% in U.S. dollars and 4% to 7% in local currency and an increase in adjusted diluted EPS of 10% to 14%.","For the full year 2017 we expect sales in the range of $6.340 billion to $6.5 billion and EPS in the range of $2.84 to $2.92 respectively. For the full year this represents sales and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 1% to 3% and 4% to 7% over 2016 levels. I can just say that we're all very encouraged by the continued strong performance of Amphenol in 2016 and we look forward to driving further strength going forward into the future even given the many dynamics around the world.","I'm confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon our new levels of revenues and earnings and to continue to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position, while also expanding our profitability.","At this point operator we'd be very happy to take any questions if there maybe.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. The question-and-answer period will now begin. As per the company's request please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Our first question would come from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amit Daryanani","Hey thanks. I have a question and a follow up, I guess first off congrats on a really good year again to you guys. Adam, when I look at the full year guide you\u2019re looking at about 2% organic growth, could you just help me understand because all the end markets you went through I think the worst you talked about was a flat assumption for the most were up low to high single-digits. Just help me what's the context for the 2% organic growth when it would appear that a lot of your peers a lot of the semiconductor guys as a somewhat more positive end demand trends. One of the subtractions that you see that we should be cognizant about.","Adam Norwitt","Well thank you very much Amit. Look, I think I went through the various markets and you mentioned it right away that we do expect mobile to be flat. And I think we have a few other markets where I mentioned single-digit or low single-digit growth. And at the end of the day the guidance that we have given represents our outlooks sitting here today in the third or fourth week of January looking out over what we expect for the year.","I think it is still a market that remains uncertain, so we remain very poise to capitalize on any opportunities that may come our way. And so, again as we sit here and look out over the next 12 months, for us we think this is a very prudent guidance and appropriate guidance given the markets that we see. But we\u2019ll remain very capable and eager to capitalize on any other opportunities.","Amit Daryanani","Fair enough. And if I could just follow-up, on the EPS guidance I appreciate the FX discussion you guys had on revenues. Could you just help me think about how much is FX and commodity headwind for you guys in the March and 2017 guidance that\u2019s embedded in the numbers you outlined today?","Craig Lampo","Sure, from an FX perspective we see certainly we talked about that in my prepared remarks in regards to the \u201817 guidance that there is certainly was some strengthening of the dollar that had some impact of offsetting the positive impact of acquisitions and more specifically they impact of the dollar strengthening in \u201817 versus the average \u201816 rate was roughly 2% I would say, which reflect -- which is reflected in the kind of our current guidance. So that really is the FX impact on the full year and it\u2019s not so much different for the first quarter.","In regards to commodities, we certainly as we have kind of talked about this before there certainly has been recent increases of some sizes in certain commodities in particular copper, it\u2019s difficult to say what the impact will be in the future. But as we have said before the ultimate impact really depends on the balance of the input cost and the pricing environment and that balance tends to kind of somewhat depend on demand levels.","So I think there is certainly some risk by the additional inflationary pressures could provide some pressure from a commodity perspective, but I think our strong entrepreneurial management team will keep a close eye on all these input cost and do their best to balancing capitalize on any opportunities and minimize any cost increases and whatever to maximize the profitability of the company.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question would come from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is now open.","Matt Sheerin","Yes thanks, good afternoon guys. Just a question regarding FCI as you pointed out Adam more creative than you thoughts did a great job of integrating that. So it sounds like in terms of incremental cost savings that\u2019s kind of played out, but as you look at cross selling opportunities particularly in your the datacom market, industrial and then also through distribution, where are we there in terms of opportunities for incremental growth?","Adam Norwitt","Yes well thank you very much, Matt. You\u2019re absolutely correct, we are very happy with the performance improvements of FCI and whether those are cost savings or pricing discipline whatever it is, as you know to us profit is price minus cost and I think the team has really embraced that very comprehensive approach to profit improvement without just saying well we\u2019re going to improve one light item here or there.","They really did embrace the Amphenol approach to it which is look everything is up for grab here and let\u2019s just make the bottom-line perform better and a lot of credit to the FCI management team.","The people who were there before and who are there still today, in terms of the cross selling, I\u2019ll tell you when I look at the markets where FCI has a significant presence and I look at our overall performance, this year even from an organic perspective take a market like a IT datacom, where we obviously had very, very strong performance here in the fourth quarter, 27% organic growth, with 11% organic growth on a full year basis.","I can tell you that I would take some portion of that some impact of that has come from the fact that together with FCI we have today really the broadest offering into that market, the leading technology, the best footprint to support customers wherever they maybe in the world and without being able to pinpoint what a number would be I can tell you that they have had already a positive impact really in that important market, which was for them really a very significant market.","And the same when I look at our performance in a wireless infrastructure up 10% organically in the quarter, up 9% for the full year, certainly a higher level of performance than we had anticipated coming into 2016 and there again without being able to pinpoint an exact arithmetic impact that they had I think we have had clearly benefits inside of Amphenol on having had them.","As it relates to distribution, there is no doubt about it that our relationship with distributors today is a broader more strategic relationship across multiple markets than it was in the past. I mean you know well Matt our legacy in distribution, which comes from our harsh environment Millero [ph] and industrial products we were never traditionally viewed as a core partner in the IT datacom market and in those types of connectors, which in addition are being repackaged into embedded computing in the industrial market.","And I can tell you today whole heartedly that that has changed. And what will be the benefits for that? Sometimes those benefits take a while to leach in to the relationship in terms of actually selling through and accelerating the sell through. But no question that already our seat at the table with these distributors is more significant than it has been in the past. And I would expect and be very confident that long-term that will deliver a good results for the company.","Matt Sheerin","Okay great. And just as a follow-up just quickly regarding the guidance on mobility to be flat for the year, but down 20% sequentially implies that you're going to be down year-over-year to start the year. So are you expecting it to be more backend loaded where you've got some visibility perhaps into new program ramps in the back half?","Adam Norwitt","Yes I think your math is correct. I think we do expect in the first quarter to be down a bit year-over-year and that would imply that later in the year we would be up. And as always we forecast on the basis of what we see today, this is a market that is one of the least visible markets and in fact as the single least visible markets that we have to give guidance on.","You will remember that I'm not very good at giving guidance in this market two years ago I guided it flat and we were up 13% and last year I guided flat and we were down 15%. I am hopeful that I will be closer to the former than the latter this year, but right now what we see is that it will be flat.","The 20% or so down that we see here in the first quarter is actually a little bit less than it was down last year. You'll remember that in Q1 of last year we were down something around 32%, 33% from the fourth quarter of 2015. Now obviously we're down from a lower level because we were down quite significantly on a year-over-year basis so that doesn't -- shouldn't surprise anybody. But it is very normal in that market that you have year-end where there is a little bit stronger second half that is little bit stronger and that's what happened this year.","If we look at our second half performance in 2016 we were still up in kind of the mid-teens compared to the first half. But that compares to a prior year where we were up by a more significant amount. And I think our guidance right now would imply that our second half would be up a bit more compared to our first half than we saw here in 2016.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Shawn Harrison from Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","Shawn Harrison","Hi, afternoon.","Adam Norwitt","Good afternoon, Shawn.","Shawn Harrison","Just the mobile networks business, kind of I think it beat almost every quarter your expectations as 2016 progressed. Maybe if you could just talk about regionally where the upside came from exiting the year and maybe why you can't see growth again in 2017?","Craig Lampo","No, I think you're correct. Forget us in the first quarter we would beat, but I think we basically beat throughout the course of the year. And no doubt about it as we look at the full year and our performance we did not anticipate to perform at the levels that we did here for the full year. If we just look at the quarter and for the year from a regional perspective, we did grow in the quarter organically in every region, but I would tell you that our strongest performance in the fourth quarter was in Europe.","We had really excellent performance and that was both with OEMs as well as with operators. So interconnect products as antennas that we sell in the mobile networks market. And we feel really good about that, it's not necessarily the most robust spending environment in Europe. And I think our team did a great job. On a full year basis again Europe was the leader in our overall performance growing quite robustly on an organic basis.","So I think that was really excellent really opportunity that we were able to capitalize upon to grow, which we didn't necessarily coming into the year. I think as we sit here today we can only look at the spending outlook of our customers. And all what we have heard from either from reading that publically or from otherwise interacting with the customers is that it looks to be a relatively muted spending environment this year. There is not big new systems being built 5G is probably still a little bit on the horizon. And so that\u2019s where we stand today.","All that things said, just like I said with mobile device this is a market where sometimes that figure can get turned on when you least expect it. And it\u2019s important for us as an organization to be poised and ready and part of being poised and ready here is having done the work with our product development to make sure that we have the right products for the next generation systems that our customers are ultimately going to invest in.","And that extends from connectors of all types to value add, interconnect assemblies all the way to the antennas. And so our teams have done a really outstanding job over the last couple of years making sure that we are really in a leadership position from a technology perspective.","And we believe that to the extent that there is spending that\u2019s maybe unexpected in 2017 wherever it maybe that we\u2019ll be there is really the first phone call for those customers in order to help them manage through the build outs that they need to have.","The thing that I have talked about in this market for so long is the fact that you have a kind of unstoppable march upward of the demand from consumers on the networks, the traffic in the networks. And whether that\u2019s me watching videos on my phone or my kids doing that or the coverage that remains in many geographies still very, very spotty there\u2019s no question that there is an accelerating demand really at the user level.","How that ultimately translates to the capital spending patterns of the customers, it\u2019s not always really unlocks step units in as you know well they tend to have other reasons for deciding when they spend and when they don\u2019t spend. And thus it\u2019s just really important for us to be ready to be able to pivot quickly towards where the spending comes and to be able to capitalize upon that faster than our peers. And I think we did that this year and we\u2019ll remain poised to do that in the coming year.","Shawn Harrison","And if I may one real quick follow-up to Adam, $1 billion buyback I think is largest you\u2019ve ever announced and typically you run through the entire authorization is that the expectation with this buyback over the next few years?","Adam Norwitt","Sure, so actually just to correct you the largest buyback or at least roughly equals the buyback we did in 2011 where we bought roughly a billion over 2011 and 2012. And this certainly represents actually much smaller as a percentage of free cash flow than it did at that point. This does represent roughly 50% of our free cash flow return to shareholders including our dividend programs so this would be consistent with our capital deployment strategy where the other half of our free cash flow will be allocated towards M&A over the longer term.","We certainly continue to have a thoughtful and balanced approach to that where we certainly look towards spending our free cash flow towards acquisition since we think that provides ultimately the best return of capital. But certainly our dividend program and stock buyback program are two important levers to our capital deployment strategy and we think that this share repurchase program really is going to be a great program to continue to have that balanced approach going forward and support that.","Craig Lampo","I would just maybe add one thing Shawn I mean you asked does it get satisfied in two years, it\u2019s a two year plan, you know that we always keep flexibility and last year we made the biggest acquisition in our history and that was $1.2 billion that we spent on that acquisition. We have not announced another biggest acquisition in our history here.","We will always prioritize acquisitions as the best use of capital for the company at the same time the company generates a lot of cash. So sitting here today it\u2019s a two year plan and we typically when we announced the length of a plan we would anticipate to use that plan, but it all depends ultimately on whether there is other attractive acquisition opportunities, which we would clearly prioritize.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes, thank you. I'm just following up on the comments on industrial was it a bit better than expected in Q4? We\u2019ve seen a few signs out there in terms of maybe a little bit of inflection understanding there is a number of sub-segments there any light you\u2019d shed on that in terms of kind of how you\u2019re feeling about that some of the broad based industrial businesses?","Adam Norwitt","Yeah I think look industrial has -- fortunately for us industrial is a very diversified market and you mentioned it there\u2019s a lot of different segments of industrial and I think industrial have been in the last year real tail of two cities for us at least. Where you have certain areas and oil and gas has been one that everybody has talked about we have talked about it, it hasn\u2019t been great this year.","Luckily it\u2019s less impactable than it was in prior year, but does that reach an refection because of the price of oil or does it reach an inflection simply because it\u2019s fallen quite a bit maybe some combination of the two.","I think you\u2019ve got other areas that over the course of the year have been maybe a little more challenged in places like alternative energy various [indiscernible] regions around the world and conversely we\u2019ve had some areas that have done really well we\u2019ve mentioned before like the battery and HEV market the real hybrid bus and truck areas. We talked about our strength in medical and we actually had very good performances here in heavy equipment, factory automation and thankfully we are very, very diversified across that industrial market.","Now as it relates to an inflection or a potential inflection in industrial there has been a lot talk about infrastructure, and will there be kind of an infrastructure at least investments that will be made in our country and we are certainly big proponents of that if it would come. We have not guided in our guidance here towards any political changes, let\u2019s say that because I think it still early days and whether or not the fiscal policies of this country and the others are going to change. They may impact change, but how they are going to change I think is still up for the question.","But to the extent that there was a significant infrastructure expansion and you can bet our strong position that we have with customers who themselves may benefit from any infrastructure we would clearly benefit from that as well or we would certainly fight to benefit from it.","As we look into 2017 in addition I\u2019d tell you that on a global basis we feel very good about that position whether that's in Europe or North America or Asia. In Asia our team has just done a fabulous job of really expanding our local presence there both from a manufacturing, design and ultimately sales support for the customers. And as Asia is really moving in certain directions and North America is moving in other directions we have these local teams who are going to capitalize upon that.","Our industrial business today is a broader set of technologies than it has ever been and that's in particular because of the arrival of FCI. What FCI brought to us is a range of products that are really used in embedded computing and if you see just the revolution that is happening in embedded computing, we feel very confident that long-term we\u2019ll be able to realize more benefits from that than we would have been to do had we not acquired FCI.","And so I think that's another piece of the industrial market that we\u2019re very hopeful about long-term. Now look sitting today without any presumption of an infrastructure expansion, I would tell you that the industrial market is still a very mixed market across those many segments and -- but again we remain poised to capitalize if there is something that is more uplifting.","Craig Hettenbach","Okay. And then just as a follow-up on the sensor market understanding it\u2019s a relatively newer market for you, but just kind of as you look at the M&A potential landscape and then just look from an organic development perspective how things are going out with sensors?","Adam Norwitt","We are really excited about sensors, we just finished our third year owning a sensor company it was just three years ago last December that we acquired the GE Advanced Sensors business. I\u2019ll tell you that the team is doing really well on two fronts not just the GE team that joined us but also the cast CASCO and then most recently SGX.","Number one, the operating performance of those companies has really done fabulously and I would tell you that they have met the challenge let\u2019s say of the peer pressure that exist within Amphenol to not perform below the company average and that\u2019s been a really great success for that team.","But in addition I think they have done a great job of driving stronger performance in their own business while also capitalizing on the collaborative technology efforts that exist within Amphenol. Our sensor business had a good year last year, it performed I think very well, we grew in the market organically and otherwise and I think that we will continue to pursue opportunity to grow both organically as well as through acquisition.","I think the fact that we\u2019ve made three acquisitions in three years is not too bad, but we are certainly thirsty for more growth opportunities both inorganic and organic in the future.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Sherri Scribner","Hi, thanks gentlemen. If you look at the stock market and Amphenol's performance since November both have done very well. And there seems to be an expectation based on infrastructure spending a lower corporate tax rate sort of a general positive environment for businesses that things are going to get better. I wanted to see if you could give us some sense of what you're hearing from your customers.","We have sort of guidance that you've given us, but are your customers feeling better about spending. And then along with that, can you maybe give us some sense of the implications of the border tax adjustment that the new government has been talking about? Thanks.","Adam Norwitt","Sure well happy new year and thank you very much Sherri. Look I've talked to a lot of customers since November 8th or 9th whenever it all came out. And I can tell you that customers are very curious. They are thinking a lot about this, but nobody really knows ultimately what new fiscal or other policies are going to come about whether those are tax or trade or infrastructure spending or regulatory reductions. I mean look, I think you -- there will be change, and I think some of that change will be positive for business and some of that change maybe negative for business. And the question is only how do you as a company react and manage through that change.","And there I believe we are really well positioned, because regardless of what new policies may come. The agility that is really just second nature and integral to Amphenol is something that in times of change creates great value. So if you have border adjusted taxes or if you have tariffs or whatever I mean we have a footprint that is extremely flexible that is aligned to where our customers want to be. And something that we will manage through whether it's good or bad.","I think a lot of customers I will tell you have asked me personally, hey what if we had to make this and that in a different geography? And the answer that I'm always able to give them in a very clear way is look we have a footprint regardless that is very strong in all geographies. And we continue to be a significant manufacturer in the United States for example and we have outstanding people and outstanding organizations here. And so if somebody in the end wants to make consumer products in the U.S. for whatever reason, then we'll be right there next to them to support them.","And in many ways in some of our markets our competitors aren't necessarily the traditional U.S. companies that you all follow in such an instance I would think we would have an advantage over some of those companies. And that's in particular true in things like consumer devices whatever they maybe. But look, we're not going to try to sit here and guess what policies are. We'll stay well with rest of them and we'll be able to react in pivot if necessarily on a very, very rapid basis to either capitalize upon or deal with whatever policies may come our way.","Sherri Scribner","Thank you.","Adam Norwitt","Thanks, Sherri.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Wamsi Mohan ","Yes thank you. Adam in your press release in your guidance section you note the dynamics, uncertainty around the dynamics related to potential government policy changes as part of the reason for maybe somewhat cautionary conservative guidance. But could you elaborate maybe what would be some of the policy changes that you see as most material for Amphenol or maybe help us think through how you're handicapping this risk? And I have a follow-up.","Adam Norwitt","Yes I mean I think I just talked a little bit about this Wamsi. And I wouldn't sort of rank or handicap specific policies that have been talked about. I think nobody knows what policies are ultimately going to be reflected. And I would just reiterate that regardless of what policies come our way we're going to be well poised to deal with them. And there is lots of categories of these policies whether that's tax or trade or infrastructure or other fiscal measures. And whatever it is we'll very adeptly deal with them and we'll applaud those that are really favorable for us and for our customers. I mean look ultimately we're a global company.","We may be headquartered here in Cloudy Walling for today. But I can tell you that we are a global company. We support customers on a global basis, we manufacture on a global basis and our people work on a global basis. At the same time we're very local company. And so in many ways when we support a local market we do that in a very local fashion. And so I think that whatever happens in any geography, everybody is talking about this geography where we're sitting today. But who knows whether there won\u2019t be changes in other geographies that ultimately impact us and other global companies.","And so it\u2019s hard to just pin down the ones that maybe in the paper today without reflecting on what maybe other countries may do, what other policies may come in tandem with us to make that handicapping. I think that is a tough handicapping to do, the best we will do and the best we can do is to just stay very, very well addressed of it and to remain as agile as we have even been before to deal with whatever comes our way.","Wamsi Mohan ","And Adam just a follow-up on that, I mean you think that the agility that you have like tremendously displayed here over a very long period of time, if there was incremental production that most of the U.S. do feel that Amphenol can maintain that agility particularly some of that agility pertains to labor flexibility in some of the other geographies?","Adam Norwitt ","So look, let me give you a near-term example of this Wamsi. I mean you know and we have talked about the DLA issue that we had. As part of that DLA issue that required a very rapid resourcing of certain components in this country and we did that extraordinarily, our team did that with a number of products that you can\u2019t imagine I mean the number of different individual part numbers and the number of different qualifications that were required and all of that the flexibility in the manufacturing locations, our team went through that with such flying colors and I think you see that reflected in the fact that even with that significant issue, we are able to grow our military business 4% organically this year.","And I think that\u2019s just a snapshot of how we deal when there are changes that come. And so we have an outstanding footprint of extraordinarily capable people in the United States period and to the extent that there are policies that either incent us or force us to move production to wherever in the world, I can just tell you that this team is going to do a great job to handle that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question would come from Jim Suva from Citi. Your line is now open.","James Suva","Thank you very much. You talked a lot about the upward onward march connectors nearly being connected in electronification and everything. But the guidance generally flattish sales doesn\u2019t really connects with that, no plan intended and if you look back historically you haven\u2019t had such a modest growth basically for years and years and last year you have some acquisitions that kind of came in mid-year which should help. So is it conservatism or that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting from customers or I am just trying to bridge the comments with the actual guidance? Thank you.","Adam Norwitt","Sure, well thanks very much Jim. I mean look our guidance this year from an organic perspective is actually a little bit higher than our organic guidance was last year. So I think from that perspective I would just point that out, it\u2019s true we had the benefits of the FCI acquisition in particular we made a few other acquisitions during the course of the year that weren\u2019t envisioned in our original guidance last year. But I think it is too early to say that the economy on a broad basis is in a full recovery, and I think I went through each of that markets, I highlighted in particular our mobile devices market where we think it\u2019s a little too early to see growth, the same with mobile networks where at this point we think it\u2019s an uncertain spending environment.","But I would just say that thank goodness for the diversification of the company and the fact that we have that diverse balance in the company can also have once in a while an impact. We have some markets that are growing very fabulously, if those markets were 100% of our sales, obviously you would have higher organic growth, but than you would have a volatility on the year-end that we don\u2019t think would be appropriate for the company or for our investors.","The way we create our forecast is the same way that we always have, which is we take a real bottoms up approach to looking at what our operations tell us and the operations are telling us numbers that they get from their customers and then we of course will apply some judgment here at headquarters. And I don\u2019t think this process has changed at all, except that I would take from last year to this year we have slightly higher outlook for organic growth and we don\u2019t the impact of the large FCI acquisition.","But I would not say that this is a market shift in our outlook long-term for the business in fact we see it today still a very, very favorable long-term opportunity for Amphenol. As you say the kind of ongoing upward march and the proliferation of electronics across really all aspects of the industry, we see that as continuing over the long-term. And we think our company remains very poised to capitalize on that long-term trend.","James Suva","Thank you very much.","Adam Norwitt","Thanks Tim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Steven Fox from Cross Research. Your line is now open.","Steven Fox","Thanks, I was going to stay away from the economic policy questions and I just couple of product questions if I could. So first of all you mentioned in your prepared remarks Adam antenna is going into your auto market. I was just curious if you could just provide a little bit of color around that and what trends you're benefiting from and how you're differentiating yourself? And then just as a follow-up if you could give us a little bit more sense in Europe as to whether you're doing better on the connector side or -- rather the antenna side or the connector side in terms of your revenues most recently? Thanks.","Adam Norwitt","And sorry on the Europe, do you mean in automotive or do you mean?","Steven Fox","Sorry in mobile network, you mentioned\u2026","Adam Norwitt","Mobile network. That's I assumed you meant mobile network. Well look, just with respect to automotive I did mentioned I mean today still interconnect products are biggest portion of our sales in the automotive market and that's a broad array of interconnect products not just discrete connectors, but real value add interconnect systems. And that\u2019s something that we've been focused on for a very long time. In addition we've build now a very robust business in automotive sensors.","And we've been focused on expanding our antenna capabilities from where originally came which is the device as well as the mobile infrastructure and expanding that core technology into automotive where we see a real expansion and a proliferation of connectivity in the cars.","And some of that connectivity is with connectors and some of that connectivity is through the air with antennas. And I think our team has just done a really outstanding job here in positioning ourselves. We have a number of new design wins, some of which are already going into production and others of which will come, will roll on over the coming quarters and years. We have really established ourselves or let me say beginning to establish ourselves as a player in an area where we really weren't in the past, which is automotive antennas.","And I think when you couple our deep-deep expertise in radio frequency what we call RF technology together with a broader antenna -- a broader automotive presence than we've ever had before, that's a really good recipe to find a new lever for growth over the long-term.","Now we also know that automotive cycles aren't just every few months or every few quarters it's really every few years. And so it does take time to get the wins and then to have those wins ultimately roll on into a mass production. But I'm hopeful that we'll start to see some of the benefit of that in the near-term. And I think we have even a little bit of benefit of that in our outlook for 2017.","As it relates to our mobile network sales in particular in Europe as you mentioned. I'd say it was actually kind of balanced in the quarter between our progress with OEMs, which is more interconnect products and our progress with service providers, which is tends to be a bit more antenna. And I'd say a bit more because we are selling in addition interconnect products and other accessories directly to operators. But there is a more significance of antenna sales to operators. So I wouldn\u2019t say it was really out of balance probably relatively balanced, which drove that good performance in Europe.","Steven Fox","Great, that's very helpful. Good luck going forward.","Adam Norwitt","Thanks very much Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Mark Delaney","Yes, good afternoon and thanks very much for taking the question. First question is a follow-up on mobile devices. You mentioned some of the reasons it was down in the fourth quarter, but can you talk if at all end market related to unit sales or was there anything driven in terms of your market share or pricing that caused the decline? And then as you think about mobile devices in 2017 you alluded some opportunities in the second half of the year, could you just elaborate on the types of products be it antennas or connectors and what sort of end devices you think drive that pickup in the second half of '17?","Adam Norwitt","Yes sure, well thanks very much Mark. I think with respect to 2016 I highlighted that we saw in the year probably the most significant reductions in demand came on tablet computers. And I will tell you that that came sort of over the course of the year. We actually had a pretty good first quarter in tablets.","But over the course of the year those sales dropped off a fair bit. And I don't think that's highly inconsistent with overall tablet units. I mean maybe some of the tablet units even had a little bit lower content, we talked about that a number of years ago where sometimes there\u2019s a little bit of mix shift the types of functionalities in the tablets whether those are full sort of mobile network tablets or whether they are Wi-Fi based.","So I\u2019d say that the vast majority of the impact in particular on tablets, which was the bigger impact for us was really related to units and I think there is next year because Q1 this year had a little bit more strength in tablets, there\u2019s a little bit of a carryover impact into 2017 on the tablets. So we would expect tablets to still be a little bit drag on performance going into 2017.","I think conversely I mentioned we\u2019ve had good performance and we continue to have good performance in wearables where there\u2019s just a lot of new devices there and some of those devices are just really innovative and challenging and as you know we\u2019ve always talked about the fact that when the hardware gets challenging that\u2019s where we get to add more value into our customers and where we\u2019re able to bring our innovation capabilities to our customers to enable them to fit more into that more challenging package that wearable represents. So I think that\u2019s been a strong point in 2016 and would continue to be such in 2017.","As it relates to phones I think that we\u2019ve always said that on every phone we don\u2019t always have content on every phone, we don\u2019t always have the same content on every platform and that remains the case. And so it really depends on individual platforms and we try to win everything, but I can\u2019t tell you that we\u2019re 100% successful in winning absolutely everything. And so there are some platforms where we have good content and others where we don\u2019t and that can sometimes have an impact in the course of a year.","In the more sort of laptops and next generation mobile computing I think we\u2019ve done a really excellent job there. It was sort of performing a little bit better in 2016 than the average, but not necessarily contributing to the overall and I think as we look forward into 2017 certainly we would expect the laptops, ultra books, whatever you call them to perform at a better rate than tablets. I think you\u2019ve seen that the functionality being embedded in computers is a little bit chewing on the market of tablets as they get smaller and more functional and more connected. You don\u2019t necessarily always need to also have a tablet.","My anecdote is always when we meet investors to sort of take account and see who has what devices and I think the arc of tablets I have seen where everyone of you just uses a tablet and I can tell you just over the recent months and quarters I have seen a few more laptops popping up in the room and I think our performance is probably consistent with that.","Mark Delaney","That\u2019s very helpful I appreciate all the color. A follow-up question on margins, I think the incremental margin guidance implied in the 2017 outlook is towards the low end of the historical 20% to 30% drop through rate on EBITDA margins, I think maybe there\u2019s some mixed benefits as maybe U.S. in mobile on a percentage of revenue next year, but you did talk about some of the FX headwinds and maybe some metal headwinds. So what would it take to do more toward the midpoint or higher end of the historical drop through levels on EBIT margins for 2017?","Adam Norwitt","So actually I think that 2017 I'm not sure what math you\u2019re doing, but certainly 2017 is benefiting significantly from second half positive performance from FCI coming up to our average company operating margin levels. And that\u2019s going to bring into 2017, which is going to bring our overall year-over-year margins higher.","But if you look at our base business that would also be converting at roughly our normal long-term rate, with long-term conversion targets around 25% as we\u2019ve said in the past and actually our drop through is roughly that that amount on kind of that base business. So I think we actually we feel we\u2019re converting pretty well going into 2017 and we\u2019re continuing to execute well. We had a great year in 2016.","Throughout the year we increased our margins from I think Q1 to Q4 by something like 190 basis points and part a lot of that was FCI, creating step functions in their profitability, but some of that also was our base business and I think 2017 we still feel pretty good about. So anyways so I think that 2017 is going to be another good year from a profitability wise and we don\u2019t really see so much of a significant impact at least at this point from commodities.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question would come from William Stein from SunTrust. Your line is now open.","William Stein","Great, thanks for taking my question. Adam regarding the recent acquisition, I think you noted that it affords you new relationships directly with the airlines themselves the carriers and I am hoping you can describe the benefit that you expect that to deliver to the business, does it mean faster revenue growth or more revenue stability or maybe some other financial benefit to the company. And maybe compare it specifically to what you\u2019ve learned by having that sort of exposure in the infrastructure market where you don\u2019t just sell to the infrastructure equipment OEMs, but you also as you have noted many times in the past, you sell directly to the telco carriers?","Adam Norwitt","So thank you very much. Well, you correctly point out that I did allude to the fact that in addition to the Phitek\u2019s relationship with equipment makers and aeroplane builders they have really also direct relationship with airlines. And it\u2019s interesting in a few respect, I mean the reason they have that relationship is there are some airlines in the world who have actually decided that for them to be competitive, they want to create proprietary experiences, let\u2019s call it for their customers. And I think some of those big airlines around the world are well known, who have sort of unique experience that they offer to their passenger customers.","And part of that experience can be ultimately the way that the customer interacts electronically with the plane. So whether that\u2019s the shape or configuration of the connectors or what functionality may very well be embedded in those connectors, if they just buy an off the shelf system an interface that supplied by a jet maker, well than all their competitors have equal access to that. And so I think there are a number of airlines who are moving in that direction.","The most natural place to move in that direction is an in-flight entertainment or things like Wi-Fi connectivity, but who knows whether they won\u2019t in the end move more extensively in that direction. And when we think about the trajectory that we have seen in other markets towards service providers ultimately taking more charge of the customer experience and there by interfacing more with companies like us who help them to enable that customer experience.","We have seen really quite some transformation, we saw that probably earliest in the mobile networks market like you alluded to, we have also more recently seen that in the IT datacom market where we have seen quite substantial growth coming from service providers where previously we really in that space only sold into the OEM market, we have seen that in fact in a few areas in the industrial market.","For example, if you are working alternative energy sometimes it\u2019s not in a solar application for example, you are not just dealing with panel makers, but you\u2019re going directly to solar service providers and working with them on proprietary solutions that allow them to have more efficiency in their power generation plants.","So I think that it is a trend that we have seen really across the industry, it doesn\u2019t mean at all by the way that we do that at the expense of those such chariest relationships that we have with our OEMs. I mean I think in fact it can help those relationships because we can be important with their customers as well as we can be supporting them immensely on their own initiatives. And that can be really a wonderful way to move from a transaction relationship to a real partnership relationship with those customers.","I think that something that we haven\u2019t did seen within the mobile networks market, I think we see that a little bit emerging in the IT datacom market and some of the others that we referred too. So in the commercial air market short of maybe supplying some MRO materials for repairs and maintenance. In the past we haven\u2019t necessarily had that sort of upfront designing relationship with airlines whereby we\u2019re helping them create proprietary experiences and I think now we have that and we have the opportunity to benefit from that in the future.","William Stein","Great, thank you.","Adam Norwitt","Thanks Will.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question would come from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Wamsi Mohan","Hi, yes thanks for taking my follow-up. Adam now that you have lapped in year for FCI, how do you feel about another significantly large acquisition and if you could put that in the context of an environment where interest rates might rise and there might be disallowance of interest deductibility for taxes, would you pace for appetite for M&A any differently? Thank you.","Adam Norwitt","Sure thanks Wamsi. Look I mean we have just lapped our year with FCI. I will tell you exactly what I said a year ago when we acquired FCI, which is our criteria for acquisitions has always started number one with the people. We look for outstanding people who can really thrive in Amphenol's unique entrepreneurial environment and I can just tell you with FCI we check that box 100 times over.","The second thing we look for is technology and real leading technology that can help enable our customers\u2019 products to work better. And then finally we look for market position that is complimentary. And I think in that case FCI ticked all of those boxes. A criteria that we have never talked about is size. And I think that the fact is FCI was the biggest one in our history we did also this year some smaller acquisition.","So does FCI indicate that we change our approach to size, it doesn't because we have not changed our approach to size. If a significant acquisition came along, was available or otherwise was attractive we would not shy away from doing that. Now as it relates to the various fiscal policies or otherwise that you alluded to. I mean look, we'll react if those fiscal policies changed. Obviously if money gets more expensive for whatever reason either because of the face value of that money is more expensive or the net in your pocket value of that money is more expensive because of deductibility we\u2019ll react to that.","But I think you also know if you follow our acquisition program over many, many years. We have always followed a very reasonable approach to valuations. We have not chased valuations because money is cheap nor have we run away from them when money is more expansive. We pay fair value for great companies and ultimately create a strong return on those chariest investments for us for the company and for the shareholders.","And so I think that we're not just watching ticks up and ticks down in interest rate as we think about what the right price for acquisitions is going forward. And so look, whatever may come may come we continue to believe there is a lot of great companies that are out there. We have a very robust pipeline and to the extent that we're able to bring some of those in to the Amphenol family, we'll do so on fair terms as we always have.","Wamsi Mohan ","Thanks, Adam.","Adam Norwitt","Very good. Well I think that was our last question and once again like to express our appreciation for all of your time here today. Wish you again a happy new year and look forward to seeing everybody or hearing from everybody at least just in about three months. Take care and have a great continuation.","Craig Lampo","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for attending today\u2019s conference.

[Operator Instructions] At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Ms. Diana Reardon. Ma'am, you may begin.","Diana G. Reardon","Thank you. My name is Diana Reardon, and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we'd like to welcome you all to our fourth quarter earnings conference call.","Q4 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question-and-answer session.","The company closed the fourth quarter, achieving new records in both sales and earnings per share with sales of $1.146 billion and EPS before onetime items of $0.94, beating the high end of the company's guidance. Sales were up 21% in both U.S. dollars and local currencies compared to Q4 of 2011. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and FX, sales in Q4 2012 were up 15% versus last year. Sequentially, sales were up 4% in U.S. dollars and 1% organically from Q3.","Breaking down sales into our 2 major components, our Cable business, which comprise 7% of our sales, was up 40% from last year and 22% from last quarter, primarily as a result of the acquisition closed at the end of Q3. The Interconnect business, which comprise 93% of our sales, was up 19% from last year and 3% sequentially, and Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few moments.","For the full year 2012, sales were $4.292 billion and up 9% in U.S. dollars and 5% organically over last year, a very strong performance in a challenging market. Operating income, excluding onetime items, was $223 million in Q4 2012 compared to prior year operating income of $175 million. Operating margin, excluding onetime items, was 19.5% in Q4, up 100 basis points from 18.5% in Q4 of last year and equal to the 19.5% reported in Q3 of 2012. The company achieved a good conversion margin on incremental sales of approximately 24% over the prior year levels.","From a segment perspective in the Cable segment, margins were 13.2%, up slightly from last year and up 80 basis points from last quarter. The improvement in margin over last year -- over last quarter, excuse me, relates primarily to the favorable product mix from the recent acquisition.","In the Interconnect business, margins were 21.7%, up from 20.8% last year and equal to last quarter. The year-over-year Interconnect operating margin improvement primarily reflects the positive impacts of higher volume and cost reduction actions.","For the full year 2012, the company achieved operating income margins of 19.3%, up 10 basis points from last year, achieving a year-over-year conversion margin on incremental sales of 21%.","We're very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement. We continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and culture of cost control allows us to react in a fast and flexible manner, thereby constantly adjusting the business to maximize profitability in what certainly continues to be a dynamic environment.  Through the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved sequential improvement in operating margins during 2012 and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance.","Interest expense for the quarter was $15.6 million compared to $11.1 million last year, reflecting higher average debt levels from the company's stock buyback program and the higher interest expense associated with the company's January 2012 senior note offering.","Other income was $2.7 million in Q4 2012, up from $2 million last year primarily as a result of higher interest income on higher levels of cash and short-term cash investments.","The company's effective tax rate, including the impact -- excluding the impact of onetime items, is approximately 26.4% in both Q4 of this year and Q4 of last year. For the full year, excluding the impact of onetime items, the rate was approximately 26.8% both in 2012 and 2011. And we currently expect a similar rate in 2013, again excluding the impact of any onetime items.","On an as-reported basis, the company's effective tax rate was 32% in the fourth quarter of 2012 and 28% for the full year 2012 and included income tax costs of approximately $11 million, or $0.07 per share, resulting from the delay by the U.S. Government in the reinstatement of certain federal income tax provisions for the year 2012 relating primarily to research and development credits and certain U.S. taxes on foreign income. Such tax provisions were reinstated on January 2, 2013, with a retroactive effect to 2012.  Under U.S. GAAP, the related benefit to the company of $11 million, or $0.07 per share, relating to the 2012 tax year will be recorded as a onetime benefit in the first quarter of 2013 at the date of reinstatement. As such, between the 2 quarters, there's no net impact on the company from an income statement perspective.","Net income, excluding onetime items, was approximately 13% of sales both in Q4 and for the full year 2012.","Earnings per share, excluding onetime items, increased 29% in the fourth quarter to $0.94 and for the full year 2012 was up 14% to $3.47, a very strong performance.","On an as-reported basis, EPS was $0.86 and $0.69 in the fourth quarter of 2012 and 2011, respectively, and included certain onetime items. The 2012 period includes onetime charges of $0.08 per share comprised of the $0.07 in taxes I just described and $0.01 relating to 2012 acquisition-related transaction costs.","The 2011 period, including one -- included onetime charges of $0.04 per share comprised of $0.03 per share relating to the previously reported flood damage at the company's Sidney, New York facility and $0.01 per share relating to acquisition-related transaction costs for 2011 acquisitions.","Orders for the quarter were $1.125 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 0.98:1.","The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations in Q4 was a strong $207 million. And for the full year 2012, operating cash flow stood at $675 million or 120% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income.","The company closed the year with solid working capital management. Inventory was $734 million at the end of December, and inventory days stood at 83 days, down 6 days from prior year levels. Accounts receivable was $911 million at the end of the year with days sales outstanding of 72 days, which was comparable to prior year levels. And accounts payable was $497 million at the end of the year from a day\u2019s perspective, up 3 days from last year.","Cash flow from operations of $207 million, along with borrowings under the company's credit facilities of $101 million and $26 million of proceeds from option exercises, were used primarily to fund capital expenditures of $33 million in the quarter; the purchase of approximately 2.5 million shares of the company's common stock for $151 million; payments of $72 million related to the acquisition of Tel-Ad; dividend payments of $34 million, including $17 million to fund the January 2013 dividend; and the balance of an increase in cash and cash investments of approximately $50 million.","During the quarter, the company completed purchases of stock under the existing 20 million-share buyback program. Shares under the program were purchased during the period from January 2011 to December 2012 at an average cost of $52.61. The company's Board of Directors has authorized a new open market share buyback program under which the company may purchase up to 10 million shares. The program expires in January 2015.","At December 31, cash and short-term investments were $943 million, the majority of which is held outside the U.S. Total debt at December 31 was $1.7 billion, and net debt was approximately $764 million. At quarter end, borrowings and availability under the revolving credit facility were both $0.5 billion. The company's leverage and interest coverage ratios remain very strong at approximately 1.6x and 17x, respectively.","EBITDA in the quarter was $267 million, bringing full year 2012 EBITDA to over $1 billion. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance.","Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends.","R. Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much, Diana. I appreciate that. And let me take this opportunity to thank you all for joining our call and to wish you a happy new year.","I'm going to spend a little bit of time to highlight our fourth quarter as well as our full year 2012 achievements; I'll then discuss the trends and the progress in our served markets; and then finally, I'll make a few comments on our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2013; then we'll have some time for questions at the end.","I'm very pleased to report that the company achieved a third consecutive record quarter as we reached new historical highs in orders, sales and earnings per share, exceeding the high end of the company's guidance. It is in particular very satisfying that we were able to achieve these performance records despite the ongoing uncertainties that are still existing in the global economy.","Revenues in the quarter increased a very strong 21% from prior year and 4% sequentially, reaching $1.146 billion. And the company booked as well a record $1.125 billion in orders, which was a book-to-bill of 0.98:1. We also continued to focus very much on profitability. And in this quarter, we generated very strong margins, growing 1 full percentage point from prior year to 19.5%.","I remain extremely proud of our Amphenol team. It is in the dynamic times like these when the true value of the discipline and the agility of our entrepreneurial organization is most clearly revealed as we have continued to capitalize on the many available opportunities for growth while also driving superior operating performance.","I'm also very pleased that we were able to complete our fifth acquisition of the year in the fourth quarter. We acquired the interconnect assembly business of Tel-Ad Electronics, an Israel-based supplier of value-add interconnect solutions with annual sales of approximately $60 million. Tel-Ad has a leading position in the very exciting Israeli high-tech market, servicing a wide array of customers in many diverse markets, including in particular the communications markets as well as industrial and medical. This acquisition positions us to participate strongly with the many companies driving tremendous technology innovation within Israel, and we're very excited about the management team and the technology team that comes along with that deal.","The acquisition of Tel-Ad is consistent with our ongoing and successful strategy to acquire complementary companies with strong management, leading technology and excellent market presence. And as we welcome this strong, new team to Amphenol, we remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create value for Amphenol in the future.","In addition, our confidence in the sustained financial strength of the company is reflected in the approval by our Board of Directors of a new 10 million share-stock buyback program.","Now reflecting on the full year of 2012, I think I would just like to say that 2012 was an outstanding year for Amphenol. Our company surpassed $4 billion in sales for the first time in our more than 80-year history and achieved new performance records: $4.292 billion in sales, $3.47 in earnings per share, together with 19.3% operating margins. We're especially pleased that we have continued to expand our market position, growing by approximately 9% in 2012, which appears to be significantly above overall industry growth rate expectations. And in 2012, we accelerated our acquisition program, adding 5 new family members to Amphenol in the automotive, the industrial, the commercial air, the broadband and the IT\/Datacom markets, all creating excellent new platforms for future expansion for the company.","Our consistent focus on technology innovation and customer support through all phases of the economic cycle have resulted in the company strengthening our position across each of our important end markets. In addition, our organization has accelerated the development of innovative interconnect technologies. These developments have allowed Amphenol to capitalize on exciting, new areas of the ever-expanding electronics market, thereby broadening the opportunity for our future growth.","We have a clear mission: to be the enabler of the electronics revolution. And that mission has been very successful thus far and will be a great driver of our success going forward.","As we close 2012, we find it very rewarding that the Amphenol organization has again built a new platform of strength, thereby creating optimism for our future performance.","Now turning to the trends and progress in our various served markets, I'd just like to point out that our results in the fourth quarter once again confirm that end market diversification of our company is a tremendous asset, especially given the continuing high degree of uncertainty that's still present in the global economy.","Turning first to the military market, the military market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased 5% from prior year as we benefited from our position on a range of new programs with high electronics content. On a sequential basis, sales also increased by approximately 5% on expected seasonal uptick.","For the full year 2012, sales declined by approximately 4%. Going forward, we expect demand in the military market to remain at roughly these levels in the near term. There no doubt remains uncertainty in the defense budgets of many developed economies, which may indeed moderate our growth opportunities in the military market in 2013. Nevertheless, we remain very confident that the increasing electronic content in military equipment, together with our broad program participation as well as strong positions in the higher-growth emerging markets, will drive growth in the military market for Amphenol in the future.","The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased a very strong 23% from prior year as we continued to capitalize on increased demand resulting from higher levels of jetliner production as well as from the launch of new airplane platforms.","Sales increased as well from the third quarter, rising 11% sequentially, as we benefited from both normal seasonality as well as the acceleration of build rates on certain new platforms. For the full year, sales grew a very strong 20%.","The commercial air market continued to be exciting for Amphenol as we're taking advantage of what is really a revolution in electronics adoption in planes. New airplanes are incorporating electronics to create enhanced passenger experience and comfort, new levels of fuel efficiency as well as ease of operation. Looking forward, we expect sales in the commercial air market to increase sequentially in the first quarter and continue to have a positive outlook for this market in 2013 and beyond.","The industrial market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter, and sales to customers in the diversified industrial market increased 15% from prior year, driven in particular by both organic and acquisition-related growth, particularly in the energy-related markets. Sequentially, we did experience a reduction in sales of approximately 7% due to increased levels of economic uncertainty mostly focused in Europe. However, for the full year, we're very pleased to have grown a strong 16% overall.","We continue to make excellent progress broadening our technology offering and increasing our penetration of the many exciting growth segments of the industrial market, which includes especially alternative energy, oil and gas, heavy equipment and factory automation. We expect the overall industrial market to return to sequential growth in the first quarter, and we look forward to strong momentum for growth in the full year 2013 as our new interconnect technologies continue to proliferate across a very diverse range of industrial applications.","The automotive market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter, and sales increased a very strong 19% from prior year on an increase in overall vehicle volumes together with growth related to new electronics applications. In addition, our growth was supported by both the FEP and Deutgen acquisitions that came both at the end of last year and early this year. As expected, sales were slightly down sequentially in the fourth quarter due to a moderation in production among some European automakers. For the full year, however, we're very pleased to have achieved strong growth of 37%, resulting in the end in the automotive market representing now 11% of total Amphenol for the full year 2012.","We're very excited by the significant expansion of our high-technology product offering resulting from the 3 acquisitions we have made since 2011. And in addition, we continue to invest in broadening our organic technology developments, leading to a growing presence on a diverse range of new automobile electronics.","Looking ahead, we expect stronger demand in the first quarter as our new program momentum continues, and we look forward  to strong performance for the automotive market in 2013 and beyond.","The mobile devices market represented 24% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased substantially from prior year as our design-ins of high-technology components on a diverse range of new mobile computing platforms led to unexpectedly strong growth of 42% year-over-year. Sequentially, sales increased by a greater-than-expected 15% from the third quarter as customers increased the volumes of newly launched products in order to ensure broad availability in the marketplace. For the full year, sales in the mobile device market grew by 9%, an excellent performance given the significant dynamics that are still ongoing in this market.","While we believe that we experienced higher-than-expected demand in the fourth quarter from certain customers and thus expect a more significant-than-normal seasonal reduction in demand going into the first quarter, we look forward to our overall growth rates for 2013 to be at similar levels as in 2012.","We remain very excited by our continued strong position in the always very dynamic mobile device market and, in particular, are encouraged by our excellent technology positions across a wide range of new mobile computing platforms, which together with our extremely agile organization, positions us strongly for the future.","Mobile networks market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. And we are very pleased to experience strong 24% growth compared to last year's difficult fourth quarter 2011 as our excellent design-in positions on new, next-generation base stations, together with sales of our high-technology antenna products, drove to these increased sales levels. Sales in the quarter were flat sequentially on expected seasonality. And for the full year, sales were still down by approximately 6%.","While we expect a moderation of demand in the first quarter, we do look forward to long-term strength as operators accelerate their network build-outs in order to relieve the pent-up demand for increased coverage and capacity, which exist on many networks. We're well positioned in this market due to our broad design-in positions on new base station platforms as well as our strong presence with a diverse range of global wireless operators.","Information technology and data communications market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased 9% from prior year with strength especially in products incorporated into latest generation servers. And sales declined by approximately 4% sequentially on an expected slowdown in the momentum of spending by customers across the IT market.","For the full year 2012, our sales increased a strong 8% as we capitalized on our many new design-ins of both high-speed and power products into next-generation data center equipment. We're particularly excited that with the addition of Tel-Ad, we now establish an excellent design and manufacturing presence in Israel, which is, in many ways, the Silicon Valley of Europe.","While we do expect a further moderation of IT-related demand in the first quarter, as we look forward towards 2013 and beyond, we're excited by the potential created by our ongoing new program wins with many new advanced technology platforms. Our customers continue to push their data center equipment towards new levels of performance in order to handle the rapid expansion of data, which is driven in particular by the many new mobile devices as well as by the continuing spread and prevalence of video on the Internet.","The broadband market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in that market increased a very strong 36% from prior year and 18% sequentially supported by the addition of Holland, together with an increase in sales of our value-added cable and interconnect products.","For the full year, sales expanded by 10%, an excellent performance given the continued uncertainty that has been present in this market. We expect demand in the broadband market to improve seasonally going into the first quarter and are very excited to realize the long-term benefits of the Holland acquisition as well as our organic technology diversification efforts.","So in summary, I'm extremely proud of the dynamic Amphenol organization as we have continued to execute very well in what is still a very challenging market environment. Our new record results in both the fourth quarter and the full year of 2012 confirm again the strength of the Amphenol team. And that team and the superior performance from that team is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages: our leading technology; our increasing position with customers in diverse markets; our worldwide presence; a lean and flexible cost structure; and, most importantly, the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial management team.","Now turning towards our outlook. Based on a continuation of current global economic environment as well as constant exchange rates, we now expect in the first quarter and full year 2013 the following. For the first quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1.055 billion to $1.080 billion and earnings per share in the range of $0.84 to $0.87, respectively. And for the full year 2013, assuming normal seasonal patterns, we expect sales in the range of $4.555 billion to $4.655 billion and earnings per share in the range of $3.72 to $3.84, respectively. For the full year, this represents sales and earnings per share growth of 6% to 8% and 7% to 11%, excluding onetime items, respectively.","We're very encouraged by this strong outlook in sales and earnings, especially given the continued uncertainties in the global economy. And I am very confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon our new record levels of revenues and earnings per share established in 2012 and to continue to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position and to expand upon our profitability.","Operator, at this time, we'd be very happy to entertain any questions that there may be.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was hoping you could dig a little bit more into what's going on in the info tech market. I think you said that business was weak at the end of the quarter. Just wanted to get a sense of is that primarily on the server and storage side? Is that primarily on the telecom side? Maybe you can provide a little more detail.","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure. Now thank you very much, Sherri, for the question. Look, the fourth quarter certainly on a year-over-year basis was strong. And the strength in the fourth quarter was in particular driven by servers and there are a lot of new-release servers where we have an expanded position on those servers with a lot of our new, high-speed products as well as especially power products where more and more, the efficiency of power in those servers becomes a real selling factor for our customers. We had anticipated, and we have heard from our customers going into the fourth quarter, that the overall spending patterns from their customers appeared to be moderating somewhat. And I think we even talked about at the last conference call that, that evolved. The markets appeared to be one where there was some macro global economic impact to that market. And I think as we go into the first quarter, we continue to see and hear from our customers that in general, the outlook from the various IT managers around the world is not really any more positive and has not turned more positive. And that's why we have given guidance going into the quarter that we would expect some degree of further moderation. But whether that is in servers or networking or transmission or whether -- or storage, that's not necessarily so clear to us sitting where we sit today. But the overall budgeting and the overall spending among the IT managers of the world appears to still be somewhat conservative. That all being said, we have done a great job this year in ensuring our position across-the-board. Because as you may know, the IT industry has one other characteristic that is relatively new this year and in the prior couple of years, which is the level of competition among the equipment makers has truly ratcheted up. Whether that is from new entrants or people who were traditionally involved in one segment now getting into other segments, there is just a real, tremendous dogfight going on in the IT industry. We don't bet on which of those dogs is going to win the fight. We have worked very hard to ensure strong position across-the-board in -- among all of the major manufacturers of IT hardware and data center hardware. And in my mind, the demand for data driven by video, driven by these mobile devices, that continues to create a tremendous level of end demand eventually that will eventually demand some of this equipment to be produced, and we have very, very strong positions across-the-board there.","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's very helpful. And I just wanted to quickly ask about the automotive segment. You had commented that you thought that segment would be weak in the fourth quarter and it was driven by Europe. But you suggested in the guidance that maybe that is getting better, and I'm just curious about that considering some of the comments we've heard about auto in the U.S. maybe being a bit softer. So I just want to get your overall thoughts.","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure. No, no. Well, look, I mean, we should not be a bellwether for automotive. Obviously, our position on automotive, it's 11% of sales, which we're very proud of and it's a lot more than it used to be, is not necessarily reflective of the whole market for Interconnect in auto. But what we have seen very clearly, and we see that with the optimism that we have going into the first quarter, is that we've been working a lot on a lot of new electronics for cars, and those are going into cars which are being built and are -- where the build rates are going up going into the first quarter. So it's a combination of new programs that we have successfully designed into, combination of those products that we're selling into also selling well in the end market. So whether that is a broader industry trend or an Amphenol-only trend, I'm not here to say either way. But certainly, what we see from our customers and the programs that we're designed into is that there is a good expectation going into the first quarter. And it was no surprise to us that we saw in the fourth quarter some slight decline in that market given all what we have seen in Europe, which still is the majority of our sales into the automotive market.","Operator","Your next question will come from Matt Sheerin from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","A question, Adam, regarding the mobility sector, which was obviously up very strong and you guided down perhaps more than seasonal. Could you give us an idea? Sequentially, it looks like -- just sort of backing into your guidance by end market, it looks like that's going to be down 20-plus percent or so. Can you confirm that? And then also, could you give us an idea of the diversification within that business, tablets versus smartphones and customer concentration, because obviously, there's 2 very big customers doing well and the 2 ecosystems. I'm just trying to get a sense of how diversified you are within that segment.","Diana G. Reardon","Sure. Matt, just to take the first part of your question in terms of the sequential decline, we think it could be about twice normal. And normal, what we've seen is somewhere in the sort of 13% to 15% sequential decline. And we think because of that, that strength in the fourth quarter and what Adam described before, that it could be twice that as we go into Q1. And maybe Adam wants to talk about the rest of the question.","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes, and I think just relative to the fourth quarter, we did see great strength there. There are a lot of new programs launching. We had good position on those new programs. And it can happen. We -- obviously, it exceeded our expectations in the fourth quarter on the volumes, and some of that volume for the fourth quarter maybe would have normally been in the first quarter. Relative to the diversification, I mean, our position is actually quite diverse there. You're correct, there's only a few players. But I would say that there's more than 2, by the way, but there's certainly not 20. And we have a good position across-the-board with these players. Our growth this year, and the fourth quarter is no different, has not been driven by phones necessarily because I have talked about in the past that we have seen more of a commoditization of those phones whereby the value in the phone becomes more the software and not the unique properties of the hardware where we can add value. Conversely, we have seen in tablets, in ultrabooks, and what I have really termed mobile computing devices a tremendous amount of hardware innovation, interconnect innovation, antenna innovation, mechanism innovation whereby our R&D teams around the world and predominantly in Asia where they are have been able to work with customers to truly enable new functionalities in those devices, which allow our customers the opportunity to sell more of them. And so the -- it is really on those mobile computing devices where we have seen more of the growth in the quarter. We continue to participate in smartphones, but that's not what's driving the growth today.","Operator","Next question is from Brian White with Topeka.","Brian John White - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about the mobile device market for 2013. I just want to clarify. You said there would be no growth for that market?","R. Adam Norwitt","No, what we -- what I said is that our growth in the 2013 would be at similar levels as it was in 2012. Apologies if that was not so clear. We grew this year by about 9%, and we would expect similar order of magnitude going into 2013.","Brian John White - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And a lot of the ultrabooks seem to be coming out sometime in 2013, so maybe you benefited from some of the new programs at the end of 2012. But when do you think we'll see the big ultrabook ramp in 2013? Is it first half or more second half?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes, I -- honestly, I wouldn't really be able to say. I mean, there are products that seem to get released at different times. And there are products where you don't even know. Do you call it a tablet or an ultrabook as they come out? Do you call it an ultrabook when the keyboard is detachable or not? I mean, that I have a hard time. So I lump them all kind of into one group now, which is really this mobile computing devices. And at least as far as we've seen, those may get released over the course of the year. It is true that in the fourth quarter, there were a lot of them released, and there was a lot of production to support those releases. And I think that's part of what we saw in the fourth quarter in particular with a lot of those new releases. When will they get released going forward? It's hard to say. I think companies are constantly changing their schedules. The big guys are tweaking all the time. When do they release a product? Tactically, do they do it for Christmas? Do they do it for Chinese New Year? Do they do it for the summer holidays? Do they do it for back-to-school? I mean, there appears to be so many schools of thought about the appropriate timing of a release, and my sense is they are constantly experimenting with this. So for us to make a guess about when that would be, I wouldn't be well enough placed to make an accurate guess about that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Two questions. Just first on the mobile networks business. It seems like you're maybe a little bit cautious here short term, but you had a good 2012. How do you see growth in that market, I guess, coming around for 2013 particularly given that it looks like China may start spending again on wireless infrastructure?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes, well, thank you very much, Shawn. I think we had a good fourth quarter in wireless infrastructure. I wouldn't say that we had necessarily a good 2012, at least my personal assessment of it. I mean, to be entirely honest, the market was slightly down in the year. That's clearly not our aspiration for that market. There's an old saying, \"One swallow does not make a summer,\" and I think we are appropriately cautious about that market. The dynamics of that market have certainly been very challenging over really the last 7, 8 quarters as I think the economical models that the operators are facing -- when do they spend the money, how much do they spend, what do they spend it on -- they're still wrestling with that. Our -- the benefit that we got in the fourth quarter, clearly there was a comparison to a very difficult fourth quarter last year. But in addition, we have not sat on our heels during these difficult quarters in mobile infrastructure. Rather, we have gone out and relentlessly tried to get design-in positions of a lot of new technologies on new base stations in particular but also in spreading our wings with more of the operators with our antenna products. And I think we've done a great job at that. And we see that in the fourth quarter where these are -- this is really driven by a lot of these new base station platforms. We see going forward that to the extent that they sell these new, smaller call it microcells with a different architecture going up onto the tower, for example, that we will be very strongly positioned. But I think it's too early to call it a full-on recovery of mobile infrastructure. We remain very, very close to the customers, and we're really the only company in this industry who is close on both sides. I mean, we're very close with the OEMs, we're very close with the operators. And so rest assured that when those opportunities come, we will really be there to participate. But again, too early to call one strong year-over-year growth quarter a successful trend, and we remain still very, very cautious about that market but hopeful that as the year goes on, we can start to see good momentum there.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then as a follow-up, I don't mean to nitpick on the fourth quarter, but Interconnect incremental margins were maybe a little lighter than you would typically like to see. Was that more just a function of mix? Because it looks like the guidance for '13, you're back to more of a normalized incremental EBIT margin.","Diana G. Reardon","Yes, look, I mean, I think that not every quarter is going to be exactly the same incremental margins as every other quarter, and so we do have this 25% conversion margin goal. But I think when we look at the margins that we've achieved, both in Q4 and both for the full year 2012, we feel really good about the margin achievement. We achieved a 24% year-over-year conversion margin in Q4, hitting 19.5% ROS and 21% for the full year 2012. As you point out, we -- in our guidance, we have what we would consider to be good conversion margins and are guiding to increased ROS. And to guiding, I think, to increased ROS, given the ROS levels that we're already at, you can see that the whole team is really committed to getting more margin expansion. I think that's really saying something given the levels of profitability that we're at. And so I think that the fact is just that we're probably not going to hit 25% incremental margins each quarter, but I also don't think that should not take anything away from the achievements that we've had from a profitability perspective.","Operator","Your next question will come from Steven Fox with Cross Research.","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","Two questions for me. First of all, just one clarification on the mobile networks side. Adam, for the full year, are you guys saying that you think you can grow your business in mobile networks? Or is it still too tough of a market? I'm not totally clear on that. And if you are growing, how are you doing that? And then secondly, just looking back at some of the acquisitions, maybe not the one you just announced but maybe the previous 4 or 5, is there anything you can just sort of talk around the synergies that you may have realized, either them -- the acquisitions you bought benefiting your business or vice versa, or how you've sort of gotten more out of what you invested in the companies to begin with? That'd be helpful.","R. Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much, Steve. Relative to your first question on mobile networks, our guidance assumes really not very substantial growth in the mobile networks market for the full year. I think I explained the basis of that in the prior question. But we certainly will look forward to targeting any incremental opportunity to actually drive growth. Our hope and certainly a goal would be to have growth in that market. But today, we are not guiding to any of that growth. Relative to the prior acquisitions that we made, that is 5 for the year, you know very well that we have what I would call a relatively unique approach to acquisitions, which is we don't acquire companies with the hope to change them. We don't go in and change management. We don't go in and completely revamp their systems or change their sales force or any of this. Rather, what we do when we make these acquisitions, first we let them settle down because it's, always for the people, something very different to be acquired by a global company. But second and most importantly is we sit down with them and we identify where are those opportunities that we could create for you some new open doors. And I can tell you that with all of those companies that we have acquired, we've had those dialogues, we've had some success. It's not always quick. It's not something that we kind of force-feed to the organizations because we want to make sure that the transition is smooth, we want to make sure that we're not upsetting kind of something that we didn't even see within the company ahead of time. You never know how delicate the balance is of an organization of a company that's been acquired. But no doubt about it, we have opened doors to all those companies that we have acquired. And I mentioned earlier we have automotive company. We have an industrial focus in oil and gas. We have a company in the broadband sector. We have now the IT & Datacom, we had the commercial air acquisition. And for each one of those, we have seen great, new opportunities for expansion for those companies. And in addition, with several of them, we have really seen that the combination of the products creates for our existing customers a more compelling reason to buy both of the products. I mean, in particular, I'll mention we made this acquisition in the broadband market of Holland in the third quarter, and that has been really outstanding in not just broadening our product offering into the cable market but also broadening our presence with the non-cable TV companies, the satellite, the telcos, the companies overseas where Holland had a very strong position. And so you find out that those customers would also like some of the products that we had before, and our customers would like some of the products that Holland brings in. And that's really a model for how we approach these acquisitions. But we're not going in to try to realize some sort of immediate cost synergies or things like this. I'm very proud that in all those companies, the management team is still the management team and we have every intention to keep it that way for a long time to come.","Operator","Next question will come from Mike Wood with Macquarie Capital.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","We touched on most of the segments except military, commercial aero in the Q&A. And so I'm curious in terms of the pushout of the spending cut decisions how that's impacted customers' decisions. And specifically, if you can get into sort of the impact that has on programs that are unlikely to get cut where you've had heavier content on versus something that actually may get cut.","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure. No, that's a very good question, Mike. Obviously, we watched, like everybody did, on New Year's Eve. I don't know which I was watching more, the ball to drop or the shoe to drop on Capitol Hill, but they were both equally entertaining from some perspective. Look, it wasn't great that they kicked the can here on sequestration. I think it's fine. I think there is a consensus that appears to be that this military is not just a line item on a budget, but it's jobs, it's technology. There's a lot of importance that is ascribed to that. Clearly, budgets are going to be under pressure. There's already existing budget cuts that are there. But what we have seen is there's really no change to the status quo of the uncertainty of our customers following the New Year's Eve deal that came. We'll see over the next 40 or 60 days whenever this next fiscal cliff 2 arrives what that will bring. We will be prepared if something does happen that is more negative. But today, we are not sort of assuming that the sequestration is going to happen. Relative to the programs that we're on, I've said it before that technology and electronics in military hardware is a great methodology for the military long term to create savings. And we continue to see that. I mean, we had sequential growth in military in the fourth quarter, year-over-year growth. And that growth is truly driven by new electronics applications, things like radar upgrades, things like new types of missile systems, new networks that are being put in place, UAVs. I mean, those type of \"More bang for the buck\" electronics continue to be very much the focus. And when we talk to our customers, which, as you can imagine, is every day, we continue to hear from them that there is a high priority put upon accelerating the pace of the technology innovation in those areas where you can deliver value to the military. And I don't think that's going to change. I think some of these long-term programs, things like the new fighter jet platforms and others, it doesn't appear that those are going to be wholesale canceled. And then it becomes a question for the military: Do we upgrade the old planes with new electronics? Or do we buy the new planes that have those new electronics in them? But either way, we are relatively agnostic to that decision because we have good content on either one of those options.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Okay. And also, your cash balance continues to grow. It may even be at record levels. But is the plan there or is the pipeline, the M&A pipeline, looking more robust? Or are you likely to then dig deeper into share repurchase if the M&A pipeline doesn't materialize?","R. Adam Norwitt","Well, I'll make a quick comment on M&A and then  Diana may want to talk a little bit about the other capital structures. We're very proud to have made 5 acquisitions this year. So -- and the pipeline, we had talked about it last year, was very strong. It worked out great for us. And not every one of those acquisitions was related to people chasing on taxes. There was not a tax increase in Israel at year end, but we still were able to make those acquisitions. Going into 2013, we still have a very robust pipeline, and it's one that we continue to put a lot of focus on in growing it and we continue to see outstanding opportunities for acquisitions. Are we going to close every year 5 acquisitions? Of course we will not. But do we have still a strong pipeline? Absolutely. And do we expect to continue that program? No question about it.","Diana G. Reardon","So just to, I guess, to add to what Adam said, at the end of the quarter, if we take the cash balance and the revolver availability, it's about $1.5 billion, which certainly is a substantial number. We also have, as you know, very, very, very strong operating cash flows. So we have a lot of capacity. To your point, how we deploy that capacity is certainly an important part of the strategy for the company. And I can just echo what Adam said, that the acquisition program clearly is the #1 priority for using that capacity, and he has already really said why that is. But I think in addition to that, we have over the past few years and we continue -- we'll -- I think we will continue over the next few years to deploy what we would say is a very balanced approach to using that financial capacity that we have. We certainly do think that stock buyback and the dividend program are both also good options to return value to shareholders, and I think that to have some balance between all 3 of them -- acquisitions, stock buyback and dividends -- is what works best from our perspective. As you know, we completed the repurchases under the stock buyback program that was set up in 2011 and actually purchased about 1.1 billion of stock over those 2 years. Our Board has recently authorized a new program for another 10 million shares that can potentially be purchased over the next 2 years, and I think you'll see us on a quarter-by-quarter basis, depending on what we see from an acquisition pipeline, look to deploy the same kind of balanced approach that you've seen us use in the last year.","Operator","Next question will come from Amitabh Passi from UBS.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Diana, first question for you, again not to nitpick. If I look at your margins over the last 3 quarters, gross margin's probably down 50 bps, operating margins flat. I was just wondering, is this largely a function of mix with mobile devices ramping? Is there some of the dynamic at play here of pricing? Maybe cost pressures? Just any help you can provide there in terms of what's going on in the margin lines.","Diana G. Reardon","Sure. I mean -- and we get this question from time to time, and I know that some folks, the way they run the business, they look at gross margin and they manage that piece, and they look at SG&A and they manage that piece. And I think as we've said before, we manage the bottom line, which is operating income, and that has proven to be a pretty good strategy for us. We've expanded margins in the year 2012. We're guiding to more margin expansion next year. I think that, that mix between what ends up in cost of sales and the gross margin line and what ends up on SG&A does vary, as you said, by market, by product. We have markets that are certainly more competitive, like the mobile device market, as an example, where gross margins are lower, but so is the SG&A level, because it's a more concentrated market and the volumes are bigger. So we really look to get that operating income margin potential out of all of our markets and all of the products that we're in and that's how we manage. I think we're achieving our goals using that method. But you may, as a result of that, see some fluctuation from time to time, and I think you have seen that during 2012 and it is largely due to the mix of the business.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And Adam, just one for you on the mobile infrastructure market, and I apologize if you touched on this. I was very curious what you're seeing from a geographic basis. Maybe if you could just provide us a high-level view of Europe, North America and Asia Pac.","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure. Thanks very much, Amitabh. No, I think that is an important question relative to the geography of mobile infra. Obviously, it's not a secret that there have been many of the next-generation build-outs that have been this year a little bit more focused in North America, and I would just tell you that the strength we saw in the fourth quarter was by and large driven by North America. It was not exclusive, but clearly North America is where we saw more strength. And I think going into this coming year, I have heard, like I'm sure you have, that there are some rumblings about some next-generation builds in China. There's also further builds that are happening in North America. I've heard a little bit less relative to Europe and what's going to be built there. But no question that these builds have to happen. When the time comes, when India eventually will fully build out a 3G network, will China build TDSCDMA or will they build LTE or TD-LTE or what the format will in the end be? Will that be China Mobile or China Unicom? And these are all questions that I think today there's not necessarily a certainty to. But wherever it comes, whether that comes in Asia, whether that comes here in North America or in Europe, we're very well poised to take advantage of it. But for now it appears that North America has been really more of a driver in the fourth quarter, and I wouldn't expect tremendous change in that geographic spread going forward.","Operator","Your next question is from Jim Suva with Citi.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First, a question for Adam and then a follow-up for Diana. Adam, on the integration, I know that you said that we don't buy companies that need to be fixed or something. But I was wondering, with these integrations, since they already have revenues of about $60 million per year, is there anything as far as like sourcing or production or lower-cost areas that you can help them with? Or is it more truly an integration into the Amphenol portfolio and sharing of ideas and global footprint? I'm just wondering on the cost side if you guys, since you're so global, have the opportunity. And then for Diana, can you just quickly clarify your EPS outlook for Q1 and for 2013? Does it include any of the stock buyback that your board recently announced? I assume the answer's no, but I don't want to be wrong on that. And any details on why the inventory for Q4 went up, yet sales for Q1 kind of should be going down?","Diana G. Reardon","Sure. Maybe I'll start, Jim, and then Adam can question afterwards. From an EPS guidance perspective, no, we don't forecast any stock buyback beyond what we had done in the fourth quarter of 2012. So you're correct in your assumption on the guidance. From an inventory perspective, on an as-reported basis, inventory is up about 3%, but most of the increase is related to the acquisition that we did at the very end of the quarter. And then in addition, there were some FX impact on the closing balance sheet. Without that, inventory is up maybe 1% or so. Inventory days were actually consistent with the Q3 level at about 83 days, and that's a pretty good level for us. So if we then look at the guidance for Q1, the sequential decline, pretty much all of the sequential decline in the guidance really went to the mobile device market. The rest of the business, if you would take that out, is relatively flat. The inventory that's carried in the mobile device market is actually quite low, as you would imagine. Given the short product life cycles and the real fast-changing pace of forecast in that market, inventory levels and days are quite low. And so that inventory tends to move in the quarter itself relative to sales volumes. And so hopefully, that explains why the inventory in the fourth quarter perhaps looks a little odd relative to the guidance for Q1.","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes. And Jim, relative to the question about the integration of Tel-Ad, we -- one thing I should say about Tel-Ad is it's not a new company to Amphenol. We have known and worked with Tel-Ad for many, many, many years. In fact, they were kind of our representative for sometime from -- actually some decades in Israel. And so it's a very known commodity. So what does that mean? It means that relative to getting things done with them, we don't have to kind of dance around each other. We're old friends. We can speak openly and without any sensitivity and really attack some potential opportunities. And what those opportunities could be, I think, first and foremost, is to leverage broader technologies into this very exciting market. I mean, I think I termed Israel kind of the Silicon Valley of Europe. And the times that I have been there, it's just very true. You feel like you -- everywhere you drive, you see another potential customer, just like what happens when you drive around the San Jose and Menlo Park area. And so that's #1, will really be looking at technologies and what technologies could we offer them from various other Amphenol operations where they feel that they could get a new leg up in the local market. But that's not to say that some of the things that you mentioned -- sourcing or low-cost -- those opportunities will all be there for them. But how that will happen is maybe a little bit different than the norm. We don't have a central procurement organization. So we're not going to step in with people from here in headquarters to say, \"All right, tell us how much you pay for each thing and let's go down the list.\" Rather, what we will do is we will open their opportunity for them to visit some of our vendors, to test them to see, is that's something that they could have some cost or technology benefit from. And it will really be from their initiative, working together collectively in the management team of the group that they're in, in Amphenol. So I think that there will certainly be opportunities on the cost side, but I would view more the opportunities from especially the technology side to drive greater growth for the company.","Operator","Next question will come from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions for me, one on the mobile devices side. You're talking about business being down 26% to 30%. Could you just talk about if it's fairly broad based across all your customers that have seen a bit of a demand downtick? Or do you think it's more driven by a few customers that were aspiring to get into this market and were potentially not as successful as they thought they would be?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes, that was a very good question, Amit. Actually, we see it as relatively broad based. I think that we had a lot of customers who were doing certain things in the fourth quarter with new products, and it appears that their expectations for the first quarter are pretty much, I would say, almost across-the-board along the lines that we have guided here.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then as a follow-up, if you could just maybe talk on the cash usage. If, one, Diana, you could touch on this CapEx plans for 2013, that would be helpful. And I guess, Adam, when you look at the M&A environment, and you obviously had, to your point, a really good 2012, do you think North America, especially as some of these private companies get a taste of higher taxes in 8 different directions, they may be more inclined to sell this year versus the past?","Diana G. Reardon","Maybe just to start with the CapEx question, we -- in 2013, we think CapEx could be somewhere in the sort of 3.5% of sales range. It's going to be a little bit higher, still within our normal range, as sort of 2% to 4%. But it will be a little bit higher in 2013 because we will be funding the majority of the construction [indiscernible]  Facility up in upstate New York. So I think if you use about a 3.5% to 4% number, that should [indiscernible].","R. Adam Norwitt","Relative to the M&A environment, Amit, I think I've said it before that a seller is a seller psychologically first, and then he or she is a seller for more sort of extraneous reasons. Then, if they are already a seller and then there is a new tax law change or some other kind of externality that comes along, that could push them over the edge. Last year, there was an expectation, I think, among many people that tax rates could have gotten even worse than they got. I mean, there was some talk that capital gains could go and essentially be equalized with ordinary income. And I would imagine that in North America in particular, there were some people who saw that and said, \"Well, I was already going to sell at some point in the next couple of years. It would be wise to sell now.\" And I think we made a couple of North American acquisitions, and I never asked them if that was the reason they were selling, but there could have been some element of that. And I think there were other acquisitions that were announced in our industry and others. Will that make this year -- now that people have to pay essentially 23.8% on capital gains, will that make a difference going forward? It's hard to say. I think at the end of the day, what matters is, do they see for their company a prospect that is positive with Amphenol? Do they see for their family a desire to inject more liquidity into their estates? Those are the real important questions, the first of which, I think, we have done a great job -- and we've ratcheted that up this year with our 5 acquisitions -- of creating a track record and a reputation in the industry which is very, very strong where an entrepreneur can say to him or herself, hey, I can get the liquidity, but if I join with Amphenol, I can also realize some of the dreams that I and my team have had. And I think that story and the compelling nature of that story is one that will continue going forward. On the margin, will it be tipped one way or another because of tax policy? I think that's hard to say. But we feel very comfortable and optimistic about the long-term trajectory that we have on acquisitions and the continued opportunity that we have to find more companies.","Operator","Next question I have is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.","Ruplu Bhattacharya","It's actually Ruplu filling in for Wamsi. I just had a couple of questions. I mean, just on the M&A again, Adam, you've had a very successful program, obviously. I was just wondering if you can touch on which end markets you'd now -- going forward, which end markets do you see opportunities in.","R. Adam Norwitt","Well, I think we made acquisitions in all but 2 or 3 of our end markets this year, and that's something that we're very proud of, actually, to have made 5 acquisitions, each one in a different end market this year. I wouldn't tell you that, that's where we started the year, and we said we planned to make in each of those end markets an acquisition. But we're -- we clearly have a very diverse portfolio of companies that we're looking at in our pipeline. Our priorities are to find companies that have unique technologies, that have a compelling reason for customers to buy those products and a complementary nature to that which we already participate in. And I would tell you that, that's across all of our markets. So I wouldn't say we're only going to do acquisitions in industrial or automotive or commercial air. I mean, we made acquisitions again in broadband, which is maybe a market that we haven't said is necessarily the highest-growth market but where we feel with that acquisition now, it's able to lever up the growth in the market. And I think in every one of our markets, there is an opportunity to add that unique, complementary technology, that strong management team from an acquisition that can create that lever-up on the growth potential for Amphenol in every one of our markets. So there's not one that I would pick.","Ruplu Bhattacharya","Just on the Cable Products, it looks like you've had a pretty good sequential improvement in margins. I was wondering if you can just talk about the pricing environment. I mean, how should we think about Cable Product margins as you go through the year?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes, I mean, I think there hasn't been a very substantial change in the pricing environment. Diana mentioned in her remarks that part of the benefit that we saw there was from the addition of Holland, who had some higher-margin products, higher-technology products. And I think going forward, the pricing environment is going to be what it's going to be. We -- I've always said we are very disciplined on price, and we will remain very disciplined on price going forward. But our strategy is going to be to continue to try to sell higher value-added, higher-technology products that allow us to not just sort of rise and fall with the tides of the commodities on the bulk cable.","Ruplu Bhattacharya","Great. And sorry, the last one for me. Just on -- looking at defense and aerospace, defense obviously, there are some possible headwinds because of budget constraints and aerospace is doing well. So overall, when you look at the mix of the business, I mean, at what -- how do you see the defense aerospace segment? Do you think it becomes a smaller part of the mix as we go through the year?","R. Adam Norwitt","When you say defense, aerospace, you mean the combination of military and\/or commercial air market?","Ruplu Bhattacharya","Yes, that's correct.","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes, I mean, I think look, those markets had actually -- if you look collectively at the 2 markets in the fourth quarter, they grew 9%, for the full year, they grew 2%, which is very much in line what I had been talking about for now a couple of years, which is that the offset to the budgetary pressures in the military is the electronics that are coming in the military and where we've seen that acceleration in the electronics, and it is the very high expectations that we would have in commercial air. And I think that showed itself very clearly here in the quarter where our military\/aerospace market essentially grew at the level of the total company even though military at 13% of sales, commercial air is only 5% of sales. And thus, it is truly a good offset, more than a good offset, what commercial air was in the fourth quarter. And looking forward, I think we would expect the totality of those 2 markets to continue to show growth. Clearly, we'd expect a lot more growth in aerospace than we would expect in military but still believe that we have strong prospects in both of those -- in that collective, the military and aerospace markets together.","Operator","Last question I show is from Tony Kure with KeyBanc.","Anthony C. Kure - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones here, just, say, both questions and you can answer as appropriate. Any notable change in the cadence on demand out of China during the fourth quarter or thus far into the first quarter? I'm just trying to gauge if you've seen any discernible trend as it relates to the impact from any stimulus programs. And then secondarily, if you can just comment on inventory levels at the distribution channel, maybe what the sales outpace was during the quarter.","R. Adam Norwitt","Great. Well, thank you very much, Tony. Just relative to your first question on China, I don't know that we have seen any real dramatic change in, as you termed it, the cadence in demand in that market or any real noticeable impact of stimulus or the lack thereof. Clearly, the mobile device sales that we have is almost all to China because that's where all these things are made. Where they're eventually sold to is another question. So that's not something that we necessarily have full visibility into. So if you were just going to look very strictly, when you have strong growth in mobile devices, you tend to have pretty good performance in Asia and in particular in China. And when you have then a more substantial sequential downturn, you tend to have also a more -- a strong, sequential downturn in that market. But beyond that, I wouldn't say that we've picked up any significant signals either way in the China market. Relative to the distribution channel, I think inventories are just basically stable there. We haven't seen any big changes either way. I think distribution is for us somewhere around 11%, 12% of sales now. So it's clearly not a monstrous driver for the company. But we certainly keep an eye out on distribution as a reflection of the broader economy and the broader trends. And I would just say that in the fourth quarter, it was basically stable, no move up or down in either inventory or eventual sell-through.","Operator","There are no other questions at this time.","R. Adam Norwitt","Well, very good. And I appreciate and we appreciate very much all of your interest in the company. And we wish you an outstanding start to the new year, and we look forward to speaking with everybody again here in a short 3 months. Happy new year again, and thank you all.","Diana G.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Adam Norwitt. Sir, you may begin.","Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much and I'd like to offer my greetings to everybody on the call here today. Thank you very much for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. I am Adam Norwitt, CEO of the company and I'm here together today on a very special day with Craig Lampo who is here for his first earnings call as our newly appointed Chief Financial Officer.","Our earnings were released this morning and in a moment Craig is going to provide some financial commentary on the quarter. And then I will follow-up with an overview of the business and current trends. And certainly at the end we will have a question-and-answer session as well. But before going into the results I'd like to first introduce Craig Lampo who has been formally appointed as Amphenol's Chief Financial Officer effective yesterday, July 21. And this has followed a very smooth transition period working together with Diana Reardon.","And I would like to take this opportunity to express my deepest gratitude to Diana, who has stepped down as CFO after more than 10 years in the role. During that time, as well as during her more than 27 years so far with the company, Diana has made tremendous contributions to the performance of Amphenol.","It has been such a pleasure to work with her as CFO and I am especially pleased that Diana will remain strongly connected to Amphenol, both as a senior advisor to me and now as a member of our Board of Directors, to which she was appointed yesterday.","Craig Lampo assumes the role of CFO after serving also more than 10 years as our Vice President and Corporate Controller. During that time Craig has worked hand-in-hand with Diana and me to drive the performance of the company and thereby has gained an intimate appreciation of our strategy, operations and the financial management of the company.","But most importantly, Craig is a true Amphenolian, steeped deeply in the unique culture of this fine company. And I personally look forward to continuing to work even more closely with Craig in his new role and I'm excited for the long-term positive impact that he will no doubt have on Amphenol's performance.","So I would like to please ask you to join me in extending my congratulations both to Diana as our newest Board member and to Craig Lampo as our new Chief Financial Officer. And with that let a me turn it over to Craig for his financial review of the second quarter. Craig, please.","Craig Lampo","Thank you, Adam. It is my pleasure to be on the call for the first time and to provide some financial commentary on the quarter. The company closed the second quarter with sales of $1.351 billion and EPS of $0.58, excluding one-time items, meeting the high end of the company's guidance. Sales were up 3% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currencies compared to the second quarter of 2014.","From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the quarter were up 1%. Sequentially, sales were up 2% in U.S. dollars and 1% organically from the first quarter.","Breaking down sales into our two major components, our Cable business which comprised 6% of our sales, was down 10% from last year primarily due to a slowdown in spending by cable operators as well as the effect of translation.","The Interconnect business which comprised 94% of our sales, was up 4% from last year reflecting the benefits of both good organic growth and the company's acquisition program partially offset by translation. Adam will comment further on the trends by market in a few minutes.","Operating income increased $266 million excluding one-time items in the second quarter. Operating margin, excluding one-time items, increased to 19.7% compared to 19.5% last year, a strong year-over-year conversion margin on incremental sales of 29%. The increase of 20 basis points in operating margins over the prior year resulted from an increase in operating margins in the Interconnect business.","From a segment standpoint, in the Cable segment margins were 11.8% compared to 12.7% last year primarily as a result of lower volumes. In the Interconnect segment margins were 21.9%, up 30 basis points from 21.6% last year. The improvement in ROS reflects excellent operating execution both organically and from our acquisitions, in addition to aggressive cost management.","We're very pleased with the company's operating margin achievements. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team which continues to foster a high-performance action oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in what clearly continues to be a very dynamic environment.","Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies the management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance.","The company has recorded acquisition-related costs in the quarter of approximately $6 million or $0.02 per share. The costs include professional fees and other external expenses related to the acquisition closed and announced in the quarter. In accordance with the current accounting rules these costs are expensed as incurred.","In addition, we do anticipate additional one-time acquisition-related charges in the second half of 2015 related to the previously announced FCI acquisition. These one-time charges will be separately disclosed, as is our practice and are not included in our guidance.","Interest expense for the quarter was $17 million compared to $20 million last year, reflecting the benefit of a lower average effective interest rate in the quarter -- in the current quarter, more than offsetting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the company's acquisition and stock buyback programs.","The lower average rate is a result of the new note issuance in September 2014 replacing a higher cost note maturity in November 2014 and the implementation of a new commercial paper program. Other income was $4 million in the second quarter, equal to last year and consists primarily of interest income on cash and short-term cash investments.","The company's effective tax rate, excluding one-time items, was 26.5% in both the second quarter of 2015 as well as the second quarter 2014. On and as reported basis the company's effective tax rate was 27.1% in the second quarter of 2015.","Excluding one-time items net income was approximately 14% of sales in the quarter and EPS increased 7%, an excellent performance. On an as reported basis the company achieved EPS of $0.56 which included approximately $6 million or $0.02 of acquisition-related transaction costs as I just discussed. Orders for the quarter were $1.362 billion, up 3% last year resulting in a book to bill ratio of 1.01 to 1.","The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $235 million in the quarter or approximately 130% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. And for the six months ended June 30, operating cash flow was $423 million or 117% of net income.","From a working capital standpoint inventory was $893 million at the end of June, up approximately 2% from March. Inventory days were 87 excluding acquisition impacts which was flat from March levels and at the higher and of our normal range. The higher inventory level supports future step-ups in certain parts of our business. And we expect inventory days to decline in the second half of the year.","Accounts receivable was approximately $1.1 billion at the end of June. Consistent with March levels, days sales outstanding was 72 days excluding acquisition impacts, down three days from March levels and within our normal range. And accounts payable was $560 million at the end of June, down approximately 4% from March levels. Payable days were 55 days, down three days compared to March levels.","The cash flow from operations of $235 million, along with proceeds from stock option exercises of $30 million, were used primarily to purchase approximately $81 million of the company's stock, to fund net capital expenditures of $43 million and to fund acquisition payments of $96 million related to the ProCom and DoCharm acquisitions.","During the quarter the company repurchased 1.4 million shares under its January 2015, 10 million share stock repurchase program. 7.5 million shares remain available under the program through January 2017 and as mentioned in the earnings release, the company's Board of Director has approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on the company's common stock from $0.125 to $0.14 per share, increasing the yield to just over 1%. This increase is effective for payments beginning in October.","At June 30, cash and short-term investments were $1.4 billion, the majority of which is held outside the U.S. Total debt at June 30 was $2.8 billion and net debt was approximately $1.4 billion. At quarter end the company had issued $758 million under its $1.5 billion commercial paper program and second quarter 2015 EBITDA was approximately $313 million.","From a financial perspective this is certainly an excellent performance. Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends.","Adam Norwitt","Thank you very much, Craig. It is a pleasure, again, to be here. And I will give some discussion around our second quarter achievements. In particular I plan to discuss the trends and progress in our served markets. I'm also going to make some comments at the end about our third-quarter and our full-year guidance.","With respect to the second quarter, Craig has certainly given a very comprehensive overview, but I just wanted to reiterate how pleased I am that we've reported such strong performance in sales and EPS despite what has continued to be a very challenging economic environment.","We achieved sales of $1.351 billion, 3% increase from prior year in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currencies. And as Craig mentioned, our book to bill was 1.01 to 1, with the orders of $1.362 billion. We're really pleased with the profitability of the company in the quarter which continued to be very strong at 19.7% operating margins. And pleased, in addition that, our EPS reached the high end of guidance at $0.58, growing 7% or twice the rate of our sales growth.","Craig also mentioned the increase in the dividend and, just to reiterate, the 12% increase in the company's dividend to $0.56 per year is really just another great confirmation of the financial strength of Amphenol.","I can just say how proud I am of our organization who, despite the many challenges and dynamics in the marketplace, was again able to react quickly and capitalize on opportunities across the diverse array of markets that we serve, all while continuing to exercise the discipline and drive necessary to achieve excellent operating performance. It is just yet again a demonstration of the clear strength of Amphenol's entrepreneurial management culture.","In the second quarter our small headquarters acquisition team put a lot of work in, really made tremendous progress in the last quarter as we announced the signing of the largest transaction in the company's history while also acquiring at the end of the quarter two outstanding smaller companies.","First, as you all know, we announced on June 29 that we had entered into exclusive negotiations to acquire FCI, for $1.275 billion subject to closing adjustments. We were very pleased that as of the end of last week we now have signed a definitive purchase agreement for FCI, the completion of which is subject only to certain regulatory approvals.","FCI which expects sales this year of approximately $600 million with an EBITDA margin of 20%, is a real global leader in interconnect solutions for the telecom, Datacom, wireless communications and industrial markets with a broad and complementary array of high speed power, input\/output and miniaturized interconnect products.","We're particularly excited to add FCI's highly talented team of more than 7,000 employees worldwide to the Amphenol family and I tell you this acquisition is just going to be excellent for Amphenol. We're now going to be able to offer a much wider range of high-technology interconnect solutions to our respective customers across a broad array of end markets while also driving even stronger operating performance.","We anticipate closing the acquisition of FCI by the end of this year once we work our way through the various regulatory approvals. Also very pleased in the quarter to have completed the acquisitions of ProCom and DoCharm, both right at the tail end of the second quarter. ProCom is a Denmark-based manufacturer of harsh environment high-technology antennas, primarily for the industrial market, with annual sales of approximately $20 million.","ProCom is just an outstanding complement to our very successful global antenna business in the wireless communications markets. And it further strengthens our position as a global leader in RF interconnect and antenna technology, while at the same time broadening our product offering for the worldwide industrial market.","DoCharm is a China-based manufacturer of highly engineered interconnect assemblies for the China automotive industry with annual sales of approximately $50 million. In particular, DoCharm is a leader in China in the supply of interconnect assemblies for automotive lighting applications and will be an excellent complement to our already successful position in that segment in the Americas and Europe.","As we welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol we remain very confident that our successful acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. It is really our ability to identify and execute upon acquisition opportunities while successfully bringing those companies into the Amphenol family. That remains a core competitive advantage for the company.","Turning to the quarter and our trends and progress across our various served markets, I would just point out that once again our balanced and broad end market diversification supported our strong performance in the second quarter. And no single market represented in the quarter more than 19% of our total sales.","Turning first to the military market, that market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased from prior year by 2% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currencies due to increases in military helicopter, communications and ordnance related products. On a sequential basis sales were up 2% primarily with the contribution from the Invotec acquisition.","Looking ahead to the third quarter we expect sales to continue to increase moderately from these levels and we remain confident in achieving full-year growth in the military market in 2015.","While there is no question that overall military spending is not expanding, our technology leadership and broad program participation have enabled us to realize the growth we experienced here in the second quarter. And as adoption of electronics grows across a wide range of military technologies and as spending increases in certain emerging geographies, Amphenol remains extremely well-positioned for the long-term in the military market.","The commercial aerospace market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter and sales in this market were down slightly in local currency and down by about 7% in U.S. dollars on a moderation of demand related in particular to small and business jets and commercial helicopters as well as some impact from aviation subsystems. And this was not totally offset by what we did see as stronger performance of our sales to the major airline producers. Sequentially our sales increased as we had expected by 3%.","While we remain confident that our commercial air sales will grow in the third quarter from these second quarter levels due to the anticipated second half ramp up of several new airplane platforms, we expect the overall market to be up slightly in local currencies for the full year.","We continue to be extremely well-positioned on the latest generation of airliners with our Interconnect, value add cable and printed circuit assemblies, as well as cable management products. And that strong and broad position creates an exciting long-term expansion opportunity for Amphenol.","The industrial market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. Our sales grew 4% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency versus prior year and 2% in local currency sequentially. This sales increase was driven by a very robust performance in the heavy equipment, instrumentation and alternative energy segments as well as by contributions from the Goldstar acquisition completed at the end of last year. This growth was offset in part by further declines in the oil and gas segment as well as by some moderation of sales to rail mass transit customers.","Looking ahead we expect sales in the industrial market to increase from these levels in the third quarter and we do continue to anticipate double-digit sales growth in local currencies for the full year of 2015. Long-term, we look forward to realizing the benefits of our broad industrial interconnect and sensor product offerings together with the newly acquired antenna products of ProCom.","The automotive market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter and our sales really increased significantly from prior year. They grew 33% in U.S. dollars, 45% in local currency and a very strong 16% organically. In fact, we grew organically in all geographies.","This extremely strong performance reflected the ongoing benefits of the Casco acquisition made last year as well as continued growth of our sales of complex interconnect products used in a wide variety of applications including telematics, safety devices, emissions management as well as drive train control applications. Sales in the automotive market increased sequentially also by a strong 5% from the first quarter.","We're very pleased to be continuing to outgrow the overall automotive market as we capitalize on a broadened suite of interconnect and sensor technologies which are being incorporated into a wide array of new advanced vehicle electronics.","With the recent addition of DoCharm that I already discussed, we have further strengthened our interconnect position in the China market while also clearly establishing ourselves as the global leader in automotive lighting interconnect.","Together with other acquisitions made during the last five years we now have a broad range of high-technology interconnect and sensor products that support a wide array of new electronics applications in cars. In addition, we have become a preferred supplier to a broad range of automobile manufacturers around the world.","Looking towards the third quarter, we expect sales in the automotive market to increase further from these levels and we continue to look forward to an excellent 2015 and beyond for this exciting business.","The mobile devices market represented 16% of our sales in the quarter. And sales increased by 5% from prior year and by a greater than expected 7% sequentially that was driven really by higher demand across a range of customers and programs.","We continue to expect a significant increase of sales in the second half and that includes a sequential increase of approximately 40% in the third quarter, as we anticipate a significant increase of sales of our products in support of certain new programs. For the full year we continue to anticipate growth to be in the mid- to high-single-digits.","And we remain confident that despite the ever-changing landscape, as well as the certainly unique dynamics of the mobile devices market, are leading technology, preferred supplier relationships with a broad range of device makers and, most importantly, the excellent execution of our outstanding, agile organization positions us strongly for the future in the mobile devices market.","The mobile networks market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter and sales in this market were weaker than expected, declining by 27% in U.S. dollars and 23% organically from prior year and by 7% sequentially as demand further moderated from operators essentially in all regions.","While we still expect a second half recovery in spending in the mobile networks market, it now appears that the speed and significance of that recovery may be more muted than we had originally expected. Accordingly, we now expect a high teens percentage decline in our full-year sales in the mobile networks market.","But I want to say that regardless of these moderated sales expectations, we continue to be extremely well-positioned in the mobile networks market and thus remain very confident that with our industry-leading breadth of interconnect and antenna products we will continue to participate broadly in ongoing next generation mobile network deployments wherever they happen around the world.","The information technology and data communications market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased by 3% from prior year and declined slightly on a sequential basis on lower-than-expected sales of storage-related products. Compared to last year our robust sales into servers were offset in part by a weaker performance in networking and storage.","Looking ahead towards the third quarter, while we expect sales to remain essentially at these levels in the third quarter, we continue to remain confident to achieve full-year growth in the mid-single-digits in the IT datacom market.","As data consumption and processing requirements continue to accelerate, the IT datacom market is undergoing a real rapid transformation. And that transformation is in particular around the cloud and web service providers who are driving just accelerated innovations across the entire architecture of data centers around the world.","It is really in just such a dynamic environment that our industry-leading products, high-technology as they are, our preferred relationships with leading equipment suppliers, as well as our very strong focus on service provider and data center customers directly have created an excellent platform for Amphenol to outperform in the IT datacom market.","The broadband market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter and our performance in this space was a bit softer than expected as U.S. and Latin America cable operators constrain their spending and with sales declining about 7% from prior year and remaining essentially flat to the first quarter. While we expect an increase in demand in the third quarter we expect for the full year relatively flat performance now for the broadband market.","There continues to remain a heightened level of uncertainty in the capital spending plans of many of the multi-service operators, satellite and telco customers in the broadband space. And that is in particular given the several high profile industry mergers which are still pending, as well as the significance of currency devaluations that have occurred in Latin America.","Nevertheless and despite these market dynamics, we remain confident that we will realize long-term success in this market due to our proven capability to create innovative solutions for our customers to support the rapid growth in high-speed data delivery. And as we drive further efforts to create these enabling technologies, we look forward to maintaining our leadership position in the broadband market.","So just to summarize the second quarter, I can only say how proud I am of our organization as once again our team executed extremely well in what has become a somewhat more challenging and dynamic market environment.","Our continued strong performance in 2015 is a clear reflection of the company's distinct competitive advantages; our leading technology; our increasing position with customers across a diverse range of markets; our worldwide presence; and our lean and flexible cost structure.","Above all of these strengths though our greatest asset remains Amphenol's agile, entrepreneurial management team who reinforces that high-performance culture every day. Now turning to our outlook, the global marketplace remains a highly uncertain environment. Based on a continuation of these current economic conditions and assuming that exchange rates remain stable at their current levels, we now expect in the third quarter and for the full year 2015 the following.","For the third quarter we expect sales in the range of $1.435 million to $1.475 million and EPS in the range of $0.64 to $0.66 respectively. This represents a sales increase of 6% to 9% in U.S. dollars and 10% to 13% in local currency, as well as an EPS increase of 10% to 14% in the quarter.","For the full year 2015 we expect sales in the range of $5.540 million to $5.620 million, an increase of 4% to 5% in U.S. dollars, 7% to 9% in local currencies and 3% to 4% organically. For EPS we expect for 2015, $2.43 to $2.47, an increase of 8% to 10% over 2014 excluding one-time items.","We're very encouraged by the company's continued strong outlook in sales and earnings, especially given those many uncertainties that are still around the global marketplace. It is clear that the ongoing revolution in electronics continues to create tremendous opportunities for Amphenol.","I'm very confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to continue to capitalize on these opportunities both to grow our market position and expand our profitability and thereby to drive continued superior performance for Amphenol in 2015 and beyond.","And operator, at this time we would be very happy to take any questions that there may be.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question came from the line of Amit Daryanani of RBC. Your line is now open. ","Amit Daryanani","I have a question and a follow-up. On mobile devices, Adam, you're looking for 40% sequential growth in September. That is probably stronger growth than you have seen for the last several years in September. Maybe you can talk about is it units that you think are going up or is it content for you guys that is driving this much conviction that you can do that? And baked into your full-year numbers how do you think December plays out in mobile devices?","Adam Norwitt","I think it is very strong performance. As you know, over the last several years there are some years where the third quarter is very strong and other years where the fourth quarter is very strong. But no doubt about it, the second half is usually very strong in the mobile device segment; I think this year is no different.","As we look towards the third quarter we see really a variety of levers of growth here. And that includes units, that includes content that includes really expansion of the various products that we're offering into the market.","We sell such a broad suite of products into that market, everything from antennas and interconnect to mechanisms and even products that go onto the devices as well as products that go to support our customers in their production processes. And so, there is just a real wide array of products that we're selling onto a wide array of applications with a diverse range of customers.","Relative to the December quarter, I think you can do the math that we would anticipate at this point that the December quarter would be sequentially down a bit from the third quarter. Again, there are some years where the third quarter is stronger than the fourth and other years where the fourth quarter is stronger than the third. It is not a market that I would ever want to give long-term predictions on the various seasonality and cadence of that market. But this year we're very happy to still be in a very strong position.","And I would just one more time emphasize, if you look at our performance in this space, over the last several quarters we had a very strong fourth quarter and a very strong second half last year.","We had also a very strong -- a reduction in sales in the first quarter -- if I recall correctly it was nearly 30% from the first quarter to the -- from the fourth quarter to the first quarter we grew 7% sequentially last quarter and now we're going to grow 40% into the third quarter, that is not an easy business to run.","And I just give so much credit to our organization being able to flex in such an environment. At the end of the day that is one of the greatest competitive advantages that we have in this space. So few can flex at that level in real-time with the needs of the customers, I think ultimately that allows us to get maybe a little bit more than our fair share of the market opportunity.","Amit Daryanani","And then if I could just follow up on FCI. Could you just talk about what's the historical or the growth rate been for the company for the last few years? And as you integrate this once it closes is it reasonable to say the aspiration when you get closer to the Interconnect margins for Amphenol versus the corporate levels for FCI?","Adam Norwitt","Yes, no, it is an excellent question and again we're just very excited about FCI. FCI has just an outstanding business and I wouldn't necessarily talk about specific growth rates, but I would just tell you that they have had good growth over the recent years.","It is a company with a very long legacy. It comes for many, many decades over certain iterations and ownerships. And the business today that we're buying is really the core electronics commercial business of FCI. And that is a business that just has done an outstanding job in gaining position across a wide array of products and markets.","I mentioned everything from high-speed to power, input-output connectors, miniaturized connectors and has done a great job on a regional basis as well with customers where we don't necessarily have necessarily that strength. And so, as we think about their future, certainly our aspiration for FCI would be for them to perform at or above the levels of Amphenol. Otherwise we would not have bought the company.","And as we think about operating performance, today the company clearly does not perform at the levels of Amphenol. As we talked about in the press release, they have EBITDA margins of around 20%, but their operating margins would be more in the low to mid-teens.","And we certainly see great opportunities for FCI over a time period certainly, medium to long time period, to bring themselves up to Amphenol level margins. That has been a recipe that we have applied for many years. In fact, we're coming up to the 10th anniversary of the Teradyne Connection Systems or TCS acquisition.","Believe it or not that was 10 years ago December that we acquired TCS. And at the time that was a company that didn't perform at the levels that Amphenol aspired to and was able to achieve. And certainly over the years that organization was able, through being part of Amphenol, to really reach towards much higher levels of profitability. And we would certainly have that long-term aspiration for FCI and long-term goals.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question came from the line of Amitabh Passi of UBS. Your line is now open. ","Amitabh Passi","Adam, I just had a couple questions for you. On just FCI, are there any cross-licensing agreements or potential revenue dissynergies that we need to be thinking about? Just maybe an overarching comment there.","Adam Norwitt","Sure. No, it is a very good question. There are a couple of licensing arrangements that we have, like we have with many other companies in the industry. But we don't really view that as revenue dissynergies. Those licensing arrangements tend to be relatively -- the second source arrangements tend to have relatively small proportions and we don't see that as any material impact to the business.","I mean what we see much more is benefits. When we think about the products and the complementary aspect of those products, as well as the complementary access to customers where there are certain customers where they have done much better and others where we have done much better.","And I think being able to bring that full suite of technologies between both those sets of customers is really something that will far outweigh any immaterial revenue kind of dissynergies, as you term it, from cross licensing.","Amitabh Passi","And just a quick follow-up, we have heard from a few other companies in the supply-chain, including semiconductor companies, of increasing levels of caution as the order progressed. I am just curious how things potentially trended for you during the quarter. Did you see a slowing in the quarter and essentially how you would characterize the environment today.","Adam Norwitt","I think I would characterize the environment as throughout the course of the quarter the macro environment, I would say, felt a little worse at the end of the quarter than it felt at the beginning. That didn't necessarily translate into the results of the company, I would say.","I think our team did a fabulous job and we had what I would term a pretty normal cadence throughout the quarter in terms of you tend to have a pretty strong June in the second quarter and that was no different in this quarter, but it was a bit more of a fight, I will tell you that. And I think that the overall market environment continues to have a relatively high degree of uncertainty around it and probably throughout the course of the quarter was a bit higher.","Amitabh Passi","Any specific geographies or was that sort of a broad--","Adam Norwitt","No, I would say that it is more broad. I mean, look, I wouldn't -- we're not necessarily a canary in the coal mine for every market and every geography here. But I just think that there is a general sense that there was uncertainty. You have to fight sometimes a little bit harder for the last order.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question came from the line of Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. ","Mark Delaney","I was hoping first, Adam, maybe you could elaborate a little bit more on the strength that you are seeing in the mobile devices end market. I know you talked about how it can be volatile from quarter to quarter, but you mentioned specifically that you are participating in things, some directly involved in the manufacturing process.","And I'm just wondering is there a one-time nature to some of those sales or is there something that you would have an opportunity to participate in in future years?","Adam Norwitt","Yes, no, look, I think we don't see that as a one-time thing. What I would say is that in the mobile devices market the demand tends to have certain quarters where it is much higher than others. And I don't think that will be any different regardless of whether you are participating on the product side or working with them in the production.","There tend to be ramp ups of products, there tend to be ramp ups of production processes and there tend to be then some digestion of those ramp ups. And I think you see that really in the ongoing results of the company over many years where quarter to quarter you have certain quarters that are much stronger in the mobile devices space that tend to be more towards the second half of the year.","Not always. I mean we have had in other years where actually the first quarter was not such a bad quarter because there was a certain set of product releases. The cadence of when the activity gets hot and not hot in the mobile devices is something again that doesn't -- that is not entirely predictable in any year, year in and year out.","And we don't see that that is a very different dynamic regardless of whether you are selling products that go onto the device or helping to make the device or supporting accessories where we have also a very strong business related to accessories and devices.","I think all of those tend to be relatively lumpy and you have got to be in a position where you can strike while the iron is hot, while the opportunity is there. And the better you can be at striking with a real agile organization at that time the more success you can have over the long term.","Mark Delaney","And then a second follow-up question if you could just help us to contextualize the FCI acquisition versus the broader M&A program at the company. I mean some of the deals the company has done in recent years, GE, Casco and FCI, have been larger. I mean I think to get to deals of this size you have to go back to the Teradyne Connection Systems business you mentioned from 10 years ago. So there has been a noticeable increase in the size of the M&A.","I'm just wondering if you can talk about what other opportunities are there of this sort of deal size, hundreds of millions or billion-dollar type acquisitions. And is that the type of size we should expect the company to be looking to execute on going forward?","Adam Norwitt","Sure. Look, I think I have said for many years that we have some very strong criteria for acquisitions. And that is first and foremost technology and we want companies with very, very strong technology. And in addition equal billing with technology is we want outstanding people and then we want that to be complementary to the company.","And the criteria that we have never had is size, and I think that while it is true that the FCI acquisition is the largest acquisition we have made in the history of the company in absolute dollars, from a proportional size the TCS acquisition was actually substantially bigger.","I think at the time it had sales of close to a third of the size of Amphenol. So I think that we're a bigger company and so we certainly have the capacity to do deals of a wide variety of sizes. In terms of what is out there and what is available and what will be available, it is very hard to say. I mean, there are plenty of companies out there of a certain size. Will they ultimately one day be for sale? There are some that we certainly hope they will be. We're very patient, though.","I can tell you that even within FCI, I mean that has been a process of onward close to a decade where we have been knowing that company, having dialogue. And that is very similar to many of the acquisitions that we have made where we develop a very long-term dialogue with those companies.","And eventually there comes an inflection point where the owner of the company, be that the owner\/operator or in this case the financial owner, decides that they are ready to consider selling that. And I think that there are large companies that are out there. Will those be in the near-term or even medium-term actionable from an acquisition standpoint? That is very hard to say.","So it doesn't mean that we won't do acquisitions also of smaller size. As you saw in the quarter, we made two other acquisitions, $20 million in size, $50 million in size. We will continue to pursue a very broad range of acquisition targets all around those criteria of having strong technology outstanding people and complementary market positions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question came from the line of Mr. Mike Wood of Macquarie. Your line is now open, sir.","Mike Wood","Regarding industrial and just local consumption oriented markets in China, there are two markets where some industrial companies had been reporting softness. Can you just speak to what Amphenol is seeing there? And regarding those trends, has there been any destocking or you think maybe sell-in is underperforming sell-through?","Adam Norwitt","Yes. So, when you talk about industrial in certain of these geographies, I wouldn't necessarily say that the performance of our industrial business in this case was really geographically focused. I mean there was nothing really of note geographically in our performance.","I think I mentioned that we saw a continued and relatively significant decline in our sales to oil and gas markets. That is not geographical; I mean there is oil and gas in business in Asia, in Europe and in North America. We also saw some declines in rail mass transit as well. I think rail mass transit -- maybe there was a little bit more of that decline in Asia, but not so material to the impact.","So I wouldn't necessarily characterize the performance of our industrial business on a geographical basis. The strength that we saw in places like heavy equipment and instrumentation, again just on an organic basis, were not necessarily geographically focused either.","I think those were in new areas where we have new technologies and in particular where we have seen just this increasing prevalence of adoption of new electronics onto industrial equipment. And that is something that we see in particular in the heavy equipment and the sort of agriculture and mining and those type of very harsh environment large equipment areas of the industrial market where there is, seems to be actually quite an acceleration of the adoption of electronics. As companies by to embed more functionality in their devices and in their equipment in order to compete in a marketplace which is maybe not so favorable.","Mike Wood","And as a follow can you just speak to your capacity? You mentioned your M&A pipeline, but just in terms of the leverage which I roughly calculate around two times EBITDA after FCI would be closed. Do you feel at all constrained by additional deals this year or by an operational capacity?","Craig Lampo","Sure. I will take that one. At the end of the quarter -- I mean the answer is no. At the end of the quarter the company has in excess of $2.1 billion of capacity between our cash and revolver availability. Not to mention certainly our strong operating cash flow that the company continues to generate.","As we previously disclosed, we have earmarked about $1.3 billion of that capacity for acquisitions of FCI, the majority of which will be funded with our international cash. And certainly while this is a somewhat bigger deal than we've done in the past, as Adam just mentioned, relative to the size of Amphenol, certainly it is not our large deal. And certainly is well within the company's capital leverage capacity given full and appropriate consideration to certainly the importance of our ratings.","In the future we will certainly continue to have a thoughtful and balanced approach to deploying our capital and financial strength, giving appropriate consideration and priority of certainly first to our acquisition program and then to our dividend program and probably lastly, to our stock buyback program.","So in the near-term, depending on future acquisition activity, including FCI, that weighting may be a little bit more skewed towards our acquisition program. But as a management team we believe this certainly provides the best long-term return to our shareholders.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Shawn Harrison","And Craig, congrats on the official appointment, wanted to dig in a little bit more on just mobile infrastructure in terms of where you are seeing the incremental weakness by geography, if you could help us out with that. And the weakness that you are seeing in the back half, does that mean that you are seeing projects spill into 2016 or is this stuff just -- that is not going to be built out?","Adam Norwitt","Yes, no. I think it is actually pretty interesting. When you look at it on a year-over-year basis in local currency, essentially all geographies are down by the same amount. And so, the amount by which we were down, that kind of 23% in local currency, that was spot on in each geography really kind of the same number.","And while that is a coincidence of course, because there is not necessarily a correlation, I think it is indicative of one thing. And that is that you had a very significant build out cycle last year, no doubt about it. And there is always some digestion. But in addition to the digestion there is a little bit of what I would call indigestion that comes from a few [Technical Difficulty] happening.","And one of those is just broadly in the carrier space there is a lot of activity, corporate activity, mergers, discussions, acquisitions, regulatory things that are happening. That is one. And then you see that is more in the West in North America in particular and then a little bit in Europe. But you have also in China some government-related actions that are happening that are also keeping a damper on the mobile infrastructure spending in the first half.","I think as we look towards the second half we do anticipate the second half being stronger than the first half, just not at the level that we had originally come into the year talking about. I mean if you remember, Shawn, very well, last quarter we also had to adopt a bit more negative view of this market and we incrementally feel a little more negative this time. And that doesn't feel so great in that wireless infrastructure market.","But it just appears that the spending is being extended a little bit and in the end the overall levels for the full year will be less. Does that mean that it that is kind of permanently lost? I don't think so whatsoever. At the end of the day the data rates, the consumption, the expansion of devices is still going unabated.","I saw just a statistic which I am sure many of you saw this week, I mean overall mobile data usage up 51% year over year in the second quarter and on a global basis. I mean those are numbers that have tremendous ultimate impact on the requirements to invest in next-generation networks. And we see still an amazing amount of activity around designing the next generation.","You talk about 3G, then to 4G, LTE, then to 5G. I am sure one day we're all going to be sitting around here and I'll have a full head of gray hair and we will be talking about 10G. But there is just this sort of immutable march forward in the demands of mobile data that ultimately does drive the investment cycle.","And as I have said for years past, it goes in these cycles. We never relax our efforts to gain strong position across a wide array of OEMs and service providers because we know that ultimately that pent-up demand has to get satisfied. We saw that last year and we're very confident that over the coming years we will continue to see strong needs of capital investments and equipment upgrades and technology advances in the wireless infrastructure market.","Shawn Harrison","And just as a follow-up on FCI, I guess one of the concerns I have received is that, FCI being owned by private equity for a number of years now, almost 10, maybe Bain has squeezed a lot of blood from the stone.","How do you generate the margins and push margins higher in that business? Is it revenue synergies? Is it ways to sprinkle -- I don't know if this is the best term -- the Amphenol dust on the business and bring it into the fold and there is opportunities there? Is there something else? Because I guess the general concern is that Bain was running it pretty lean. What opportunities does Amphenol have to improve the cost structure and margin profile?","Adam Norwitt","Sure, it is an excellent question. And it is true, Bain owned it for nine years and I think by owning it for so long, by the way, we're not able to kind of starve the business either. They had to and they did continue to invest very strongly in the business over many years.","As we look towards the operating improvements, I think you mentioned a number of things and I am not going to claim that we have pixie dust at Amphenol. But we certainly have an approach in the company towards expansion of operating profitability and really alignment of accountabilities such that you achieve that operating profitability.","And that is something that we will work very hard with the FCI team, who is very excited, by the way, to be a part of that entrepreneurial culture. And we think that in and of itself has tremendous impacts on the profitability of the company.","That was something we saw at the time with TCS that is something that we have seen with the GE sensors business. I mean time and again when you bring a company in that has come maybe from a slightly different approach and you bring them into that decentralized, accountable model of Amphenol you have really some fabulous impact that comes from that.","Obviously from a revenue and a technology, I mean there are a lot of great, great opportunities to leverage the unique technologies that each of us have where collectively we can create better solutions for our customer either better cost solutions or better technology solutions.","I mean FCI has just certain really fantastic innovations across the company where we will seek to apply some of those innovations more broadly across Amphenol and vice versa. And I think that that can also have a great impact on the overall operating results of the company.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question came from the line of Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Sherri Scribner","Adam, I was hoping you could help us think through the guidance. It looks like you took the full-year guidance up at the low end but kept the high end the same. But the third quarter numbers look better than most people's expectations. So that implies that the fourth quarter was a bit lower than people's expectations.","It seems to me that that is probably related to the seasonality of the mobile devices segment this quarter. But was hoping you could give us some thoughts on that seasonality this year and the fact that the guidance didn't really change that much.","Adam Norwitt","Sure. No, I think you have answered your own question, Sherri, as far as I am concerned. As usual, you do the analysis perfectly. It is very true that we have raised -- we never gave third-quarter guidance, first of all. So I think we have always given full-year guidance and we're very happy to be able to sustain that full-year guidance.","I think we feel that the third quarter is strong in mobile and I think I already mentioned that we would anticipate in the December quarter to see a little bit of a sequential moderation in our sales into the mobile devices market.","I think relative to that full-year guidance we have obviously the benefit of the two acquisitions. And I mentioned as well that from an organic standpoint we see our range at really a 3% to 4% organic growth range. And that is a slight tick down from what we had seen before all for the reasons that I discussed in the various markets and in particular across the carrier market.","So, I think that the uncertainty in particular in those carrier-based markets, the mobile infrastructure and broadband markets, with all that is going on in that space that injects maybe a little bit more dose of conservatism into our outlook.","But net-net we're extremely pleased to have that guidance really holding at the high end, bringing that up at the low end and with a real strong sense of confidence given a market environment that we think has incrementally gotten a little bit more challenging throughout the course of the quarter.","Sherri Scribner","And it actually feeds into my follow-up which was in the press release you noted an increased level of uncertainty globally. In answer now you just suggested maybe that is just related to the carrier segment. But wanted to get a sense of where you are seeing the uncertainty. Is it generally pretty broad, is it some segments like carrier or is it some other segments too? Thank you.","Adam Norwitt","No, I think when I talked about the carrier, that is really the specific impact to our outlook. I think the general comment about uncertainty in the marketplace is really more of a general one. As I mentioned I think early on, just as the quarter went on it was a little bit more of a fight to get the orders. I think our team is really up to the task and they did a fantastic job given that environment and we're confident that we will continue to do an excellent job given that environment going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of William Stein of SunTrust. Your line is now open. ","William Stein","Congratulations on the good outlook relative to what we're seeing elsewhere. And that is really what I would like to focus on. One of the areas that some other component and semiconductor companies have talked about is channel inventory adjustments denting their Q3 outlooks. I am wondering if you are saying anything in this regard, if you are seeing any actions by either end customers or the channel in reducing inventory?","Adam Norwitt","Yes, look, in the channel as it is distribution, distribution represents under 13% of our sales in the quarter. And I don't know that we have seen anything really marked in terms of massive inventory reduction or changes. I wouldn't say that the distribution channel has been very frothy in the quarter.","And when we talk about it being a little bit more of a fight, maybe there is some component of that that is related to distribution. But again, it hasn't been that there was like a pivot in the behavior of our distributors or in the behavior of the sell-through with our distributors. I think that it is just a little bit more sometimes of a challenge and maybe a little bit more of a conservatism on their part, but we don't see big inventory reductions, pullbacks, massive corrections coming out of that channel right now.","William Stein","And one follow-up if I can, I'm wondering if you might give us an update on the progress of the sensor business? You have done a couple of acquisitions there in the last year or two. And I know that you highlighted some design wins in particular in automotive I think. Maybe you could just kind of give us an update on how that part of the business is progressing?","Adam Norwitt","Sure. No, look, we continue to be really excited about our sensor business. It is coming up, believe it or not, on a year and a half. We passed the year and a half mark of owning the GE sensors business; end of this year it will already be two years. Time flies. And Casco was acquired nearly a year ago.","And I would just reiterate, as I have said on the last several calls, that we feel really excited about that. And we continue to get great affirmation from customers that us owning a sensor business is a really good thing for the company, a good thing for our customers and a good thing for the technology solutions that we can provide.","We're working very hard on a very collaborative basis across the company to uncover and to pursue opportunities where we can really bring in a sensor and an interconnect together with maybe our industrial business or our automotive business. And I would say that we have had good wins in that area.","I wouldn't point to anything that is really material to the outlook of the company as yet, but I think the long-term prognosis for our sensor business is excellent as is the long-term prognosis for the opportunity of having that sensor and interconnect solution. The ability to package the sensor together with a harsh environment or otherwise interconnect solution is something that is very special. And it is something that our customers appear to have a great desire to engage with us on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. ","Craig Hettenbach","I guess it is not pixie dust, maybe the word is Amphenolian. But just on the automotive business, that has come quite a far way in the last couple years through a mix of the organic as well as acquisitions. Can you talk about where you are from a penetration standpoint and how much you have to gain from that versus just the overriding increasing content theme?","Adam Norwitt","Sure. I mean, look, we're still small on a relative basis compared to some of the major participants in the space. But we're a little bit less small than we were five years ago, that is -- there is no doubt about it. And we have made outstanding acquisitions over those five, six years and we have continued to do that here in the quarter -- at the end of the second quarter with DoCharm.","And I think when I look at that business today and I compare that business to circa 2009, a couple of things. Number one is a much broader offering of products across a broader range of applications. That is number one.","Number two is we now have kind of at a minimum a foot in the door, sometimes a leg and sometimes even the whole body, but at a minimum a foot in the door with the vast majority of major automotive OEMs in most geographies. I think with the exception of Japan where we have never had a strong position.","And I wouldn't say that we have necessarily gained that strong position even if, with some of the Japanese OEMs outside of Japan, we have actually gained a strong position. And then the third is just regionally. Where our automotive business would have been six years ago two-thirds or three-quarters European, today that automotive business is actually quite balanced on a regional basis.","Europe is still marginally the largest territory. But really it is marginal as compared to North America and Asia. And with the acquisition that we've just made, that will bring even a stronger position with us in China both with the international as well as the indigenous participants in China.","And look we certainly read the papers and hear everybody talking about is there a downturn in China and all of this. I mean the reality is we have still such a small position and still so much to gain across the range of electronics in those cars that we still feel a great sense of confidence in our automotive business.","And I think ultimately that has translated into the strong performance we had this quarter, 16% organic growth in the quarter and our continued outlook where we anticipate still for the year to have kind of mid-teens organic growth in the automotive market. And that is clearly not reflective of just rising with the tide in overall unit sales. So there is a lot of gaining of position on new applications with new products from us that is really driving that growth.","Craig Hettenbach","Just as a quick follow-up, you mentioned just some of the change occurring in the data center. That has been another area of potential concern in terms of is there any slowing on the hyper scale side. Any insight in terms of kind of what you are seeing from data center growth into the back half?","Adam Norwitt","Sure. I think I did talk about the fact that we had a good quarter in IT datacom compared to the overall market. We still anticipate kind of a mid-single-digit growth in the IT datacom market for the year.","There is no question, this transformation that is happening in the IT datacom market, the real shifting of the balance of power from traditional OEMs building boxes and putting them in boxes and shipping them to this more sort of Web 2.0, cloud web service, I mean there is so many different names you can call it. That transformation continues unabated.","And I think that shifting of the balance of power is a very dangerous time in the market for someone who is caught unawares. And I think our team has just done an outstanding job and we've made a lot of real significant organizational moves, let me say. Taking people who were really strong people focused on certain areas and saying, I am cutting the cord with you there and putting you into something totally new.","It is hard for them because now they have got to go from wearing a tie to wearing shorts and Birkenstocks when they go to the customers. But ultimately that transformation of our people and then the tailoring of the technologies to what the needs of the web service company that is something that we think is going to bear fruit long-term.","You've got to chase where the money is in a space like this and I think that we have done so far a great job of that. But it is not a space without its peril when you see the dramatic change that is happening in that area.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question came from the line of Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is now open.","Jim Suva","And to make up for my lack of smartness I will just ask one question with no follow-ups. Can you just help us understand, FCI has been around for a very long time with a long history, although the company has gone through a lot of international restructuring challenges and you announced that you are acquiring FCI Asia.","Can you help us better understand what does that all include? Geographic reach? A lot of their businesses over the past decade or 15 years have kind of been divested or slowed or closed down or things like that. Are you acquiring all that is left in FCI? And if so is there still much heavy lifting to do to get it integrated? Or in the past their cost structure has been very French and Spanish and kind of Western Europe high cost basis. If you'd just help us understand kind of what you are all buying here and what type of effort it is going to take. Thank you.","Adam Norwitt","Thank you, Jim, actually this was much more than one question, so you are still very smart. Let me just clarify relative to FCI Asia, as it is called, that is the legal name of the company. FCI is a global company, it happens to be headquartered in Singapore. It has a long history and it was originally, well let me say on an interim basis it was a French company.","Long ago [indiscernible] Electronics which is one of the predecessor companies, was certainly an American company. But FCI as a global business is really around the world. They moved the headquarters to Asia a couple of years ago. It is true that FCI used to have several other businesses which over a certain number of years Bain took the approach to divest them kind of one by one.","They had in automotive business, I'm sure everybody is familiar with that. They had a power business, a real high-voltage business that was divested a number of years back. They had also this what was called microelectronics business which was a very specialized business that was also divested.","And we're buying really the totality of what Bain owns today which was originally known as FCI Electronics which was the commercial electronics interconnect business of FCI and that was always the piece of FCI that we had our eye on for this nearly a decade.","And in terms of the heavy lifting that has been done, I mean the company has a great performance and it has performed better than maybe it did in the past. But we still see excellent opportunities in the future to improve operating performance of the business. And I think I already discussed a number of the different levers that we intend to exercise as we look towards improving the performance of FCI.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question came from the line of Mr. Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is now open. ","Steven Fox","Just a couple quick ones around some of the comments you made, Adam, on acquisitions. On the two acquisitions announced today I was wondering if you could just provide a couple of examples around where some of the European deals you said they have, RF interconnect exposure into the industrial markets. Can you give us some examples of that?","And similarly, for the Chinese business, where you said automotive lighting that complements some other deals you have done, can you just give us a couple of examples of that? And then I had a quick follow up.","Adam Norwitt","So first with ProCom, ProCom is actually an antenna company. Sorry if I misspoke. It expands our RF interconnect and antenna offering, but it is really a focused antenna company in the industrial market and really predominantly in the industrial market.","It is a very special business in that they make antennas get used in very harsh environments. I mean take for example on a freighter ship where you have very complex wireless communications that have to happen on a freighter in the middle of the ocean. They would make those type of antennas. They make antennas that are used in emergency radio systems for police and fire departments.","They make -- just a real wide variety of antennas that are used across a range of applications where we today don't participate. And that is what is so exciting about ProCom. It is obviously a small company, just over $20 million in sales. But it is a company with a unique technology, then we would look to expand their presence to other geographies where today they are a very European focused company.","And together with our strong presence on industrial interconnect and with industrial customers we see here a great opportunity to leverage that antenna business into a new market area beyond just the wireless communications of mobile devices and mobile infrastructure where today we have a very strong position.","Relative to DoCharm, I did mention that DoCharm has -- one of their main specialties is around complex interconnect assemblies that go into automotive lighting applications. You may recall that a number of years ago we acquired a company called [indiscernible] was really one of the leaders in automotive lighting in Europe and North America and that business has just done fantastic with us since we acquired it.","What we really like about that business is twofold. One is in the lighting, that tends to be a very important application; lights have to work in a car. And it also tends to be a little bit more of a harsher environment part of the car because it tends to be a little bit closer to the air and rain and moisture.","And so it allows you to really embed certain technology into that product for a product that really has to work. It has a safety element to it in addition and it has to work in a slightly tougher environment. And in addition, it is an area where lighting tends to change at a somewhat different and faster cadence than overall model changes.","You have what are called in cars facelifts now and those facelifts are sort of mid platform changes in the car where they don't change the drive train, they don't change the underlying architecture of the car, but they do things to the car to make it look a little better, to upgrade a little bit the electronics.","And those facelifts and mid-cycle upgrades have started to become a real positive aspect of the automotive market whereby you used to really -- if you didn't get on something you had to wait three to five years to get onto the next one. Today with that mid-cycle upgrade and those facelifts, it allows you to have a little bit different velocity to winning business. And that is something that we really like about this lighting business.","I think the last thing I would say about DoCharm is, because it is a real indigenous Chinese company founded by a fabulous entrepreneur, [Technical Difficulty] very successful in his space, it gives us a different level of position in the Chinese indigenous market.","And we're very happy that the entire management team is very committed to staying with Amphenol. And they have great role models of companies in China who have been acquired by Amphenol, but whereby the owner has stayed with the company for many, many years.","We have one where the owner has been with us still for 12 years after the fact. And I think that the continuity of the management, together with the strength of presence with the local customers, is something that has a lot of value.","Steven Fox","And then just really quickly, during your prepared remarks you mentioned that Goldstar and Casco were helping organic growth. And I was just wondering if you can clarify whether that was sales synergies with existing businesses or bringing their business into your customers? Or were you just referring to their own growth on a standalone basis? Thanks.","Adam Norwitt","Yes, sorry, again if I misspoke, Steve, I apologize. But I did not mean that they were helping our organic growth, I meant that our overall growth was aided by the additions of Goldstar and Casco.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question came from the line of Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. ","Wamsi Mohan","Adam, relative to most of your recent acquisitions, FCI appears to be very different in that you need to do a lot more heavy lifting with integrations, whereas in many of your other acquisitions you tended to acquire entities that just leveraged your scale, reach and technology, but you don't have to sort of do much in terms of integration.","So two questions, one, what are you expecting in terms of integration cost for this acquisition? Will you be including that in your non-GAAP earnings as you refer to accretion?","And secondly, should we expect to see more acquisitions from Amphenol given the relative size that you are now as a company that you would need to go after targets where you would have to on an ongoing basis be more involved in integration? Thanks.","Adam Norwitt","I think it is true that FCI is a larger company and that it has maybe some work to be done as it joins with Amphenol in terms of aligning it appropriately in the business. But let's not forget that the core thing that we look to do in companies like that is to just instill the culture of Amphenol. I think we talked about at the time when we acquired GE sensors that that was a very different culture, it was a very different organization.","And there was maybe a little bit more work that we had to do in that case to align the company towards and Amphenol like measure of accountability and operating discipline and really to bring that sort of cultural change into the company.","And that comes down to essentially making sure that you have got direct line management, general managers who run businesses to which they are held accountable and for which they have authority. And I think that is the main thing that we would make sure is the case here with FCI. I think we have really the -- all wherewithal to make sure that that is the case.","We have a great playbook to apply. And ultimately it doesn't mean that we're going in and monkeying around with the whole thing, but rather we're making sure that there are the appropriate accountabilities for the focus businesses within FCI.","By the way, that is something that the current and soon-to-be prior owners were already heading towards with FCI. As they migrated the business as they drove that towards more accountability, they were in many respects looking to emulate Amphenol already. And so, I think we can just accelerate that emulation a little bit as it joins with us. And maybe I'll let Craig comment a little bit on just how we would view costs related to the acquisition.","Craig Lampo","Sure. I mean we would expect some similar charges to those we've had in the past for things like transaction-related fees, expenses and purchase accounting-related items like inventory and backlog valuations that would be amortized early in the first year and these items certainly would be one-time in nature and we would call these out.","In addition, certainly given the size of the deal, it is possible that there could be some other nonrecurring charges. If so we would certainly call them out.","Operator","At this point we don't have any more questions over the phone.","Adam Norwitt","That is very good. Well, thank you again, everybody for your attention today. I know it is a busy day for all of you and we truly appreciate your time and I hope it is not too late to wish you all a very enjoyable and pleasant summer.","Hopefully you will get, after this busy earning season a little bit of time to have some vacation with your families. Thanks again and we will talk to you all in about 90 days.","Craig Lampo","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for attending today's conference and have a nice day."],"2097":["Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) Q2 2014 Earnings Conference Call July 23, 2014  1:00 PM ET","","Executives","","Diana G.

Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, the conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce today\u2019s conference for your host, Ms. Diana Reardon. Thank you, you may begin.","Diana Reardon","Thank you. My name is Diana Reardon, and I\u2019m Amphenol's CFO. I\u2019m here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we would like to welcome you all for our second quarter earnings call. Our Q2 results were released this morning. I\u2019ll provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We\u2019ll then have a question-and-answer session.","The company closed the second quarter with sales of $1.314 million and EPS of $9, exceeding the high end of the company\u2019s guidance and achieving new records of performance. Sales were up 16% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currencies compared to Q2 of 2013. From an organic standpoint, excluding those acquisitions and currency impacts, sales in Q2 were up 7%.","Sequentially, sales were up 5% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically from Q1 of 2014. Breaking down sales into our two major components, our cable business which comprised 7% of our sales was up 2% from last year. The interconnect business, which comprised 93% of our sales, was up 17% from last year reflecting the benefit of both good organic growth and the company\u2019s acquisition program. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.","Operating income increased $256 million from $224 million last year. Operating margin was 19.5% in the quarter compared to 19.7% last year and 18.8% last quarter. The decline in operating margin versus 2013 is primarily due to the lower profitability level of the advanced sensor business acquired in late 2013. As previously discussed, the acquisition is accretive on an earnings-per-share basis, but reduces the company\u2019s overall operating income percentage as the business currently operates at a lower level of profitability than the average of the company. We continue to be very excited about the potential of the acquisition and expect their operating income margins to improve overtime, based on the combination of their excellent management team, leading technology and our strong operating discipline.","The sequential increase of 70 basis points in operating margins over the first quarter of 2014 represents a very good conversion margin on incremental sales of 32%. This strong performance resulted from an increase in operating margin in the interconnect business based on excellent operating execution and cost management on incremental sales volume. From a segment perspective, in the cable segment margins were 12.7% up from 12.2% last quarter and down from 13.8% last year, primarily due to the impact of market pricing and some impact from product mix.","In the interconnect segment, margins were 21%, up from 20.9% last quarter and down from 22% last year. We are very pleased with the company\u2019s operating margin achievement and we continue to believe that the company\u2019s entrepreneurial operating structure and culture of cost control allows us to react in a fast and flexible manner, thereby constantly adjusting the business to maximize profitability in what continues to be a dynamic environment.","Through the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance. Interest expense for the quarter was $20.1 million compared to $15.6 million last year. Due to higher average debt levels resulting from the company's acquisition and stock buyback programs.","Other income was $4.3 million in the quarter, up from $3 million last year, primarily as a result of higher interest income on higher levels of cash and short-term cash investments. The company's effective tax rate in the quarter was 26.5% compared to 26.8% last year and net income was approximately 13% of sales in the quarter. Earnings per share increased 15% to a record $1.09 in Q2, up from $0.95 last year a very strong performance.","Orders for the quarter were $1.320 billion resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1-to-1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash and cash flow from operations in the quarter was $181 million or 102% of net income. For the six months ended June 30, operating cash flow was $383 million or 114% of net income.","The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. The company had good working capital management during the quarter. Inventory with $805 million at the end of June up 4% from March. Inventory days were 81 days, consistent with March levels. ","Accounts receivable at the end of June was just over $1 billion up 6% from March and day sales outstanding declined one day to 70 days. Accounts payable increased 11% to $534 million at the end of June and payable days were up four days to 54-days.","The cash flow from operations of a $181 million borrowing under the company\u2019s revolving credit facility of $120 million and $60 million of proceeds from stock option exercise were used primarily to purchase approximately 1.4 million shares of the company's stock for $129 million to fund capital expenditures of $52 million and acquisition of payments of $10 million in the quarter and for dividend payments of $31 million. This resulted in an increase in cash and cash investment of $144 million during the quarter.","At the end of June, cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $1.4 billion the majority of which is held outside the US. Total debt was $2.3 billon bring net debt at the end of the quarter to $900 million. At quarter end, borrowings and availability under the company's $1.5 billion revolving credit facility were $290 million and $1.2 billion respectively. And EBITDA of Q2 was approximately $308 million.","At the end of the quarter, the company had 2.9 million shares remaining under its 10 million stock of purchase program, which expires in January of 2015. And as mentioned in the earning release the company\u2019s Board of Directors has approved an increases in the quarterly dividend on the company\u2019s common stock from $0.20 to $0.25 per share increasing the yield to just over 1%. This increase is effective for payments beginning in October. From a financial perspective this was an excellent performance.","Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends.","R. Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much, Diana and I would also like to add my welcome to everybody on the phone here today. As Diana mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our second quarter achievements and in particular I\u2019ve planned to discuss the trends and the progress across our various served markets. Finally I will make a few comments on our outlook for the third quarter and as well as for the full-year of 2014, and we\u2019ll certainly leave some time at the end for question.","I\u2019m just very proud that in the second quarter Amphenol has set again new records in sales and earnings per share and exceeded the high end of our guidance. Diana mentioned sales increased 16% from prior year and 5% sequentially, establishing for the company a new record of $1,314 billion in sale.","We are also very pleased that our order has reached also a new record of $1,320 billion with the book to bill up above one. And profitability as Diana mentioned was very robust in the quarter and we generated strong sequential conversion margin, which led to an expansion of our industry leading operating margins to 19.5%.","And Finally, I would just like to note that with the Board of Directors approving the 25% increase in our company\u2019s quarterly dividend from $0.20 to $0.25, this is yet another very clear indication of the sustained financial strength of Amphenol. I\u2019m just very proud of our global team these record results reconfirm the strength of entrepreneurial culture.","As the Amphenol management team has once again able to react quickly to the many, many opportunities that are being created by the electronics revolution all the electrocides in the consistent discipline and drive necessary to create outstanding operating performance. The strength of our strategy of market diversification also was very evident in the second quarter. The Amphenol business remains extremely balanced and broad with no single end market representing more than 17% of our total sales in the quarter.","Turning to the trends and progress across those markets, the military market represent 11% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were down slightly from prior year and up slightly from prior quarter as growth in military vehicle, airframe as well as communications applications was offset by overall reduced demand in other segments of the military market. There is no question that the overall military market remains uncertain. But nevertheless we expect demand in the third quarter to grow slightly from these levels and we continue to expect this market to return to growth in the second half as volumes increased related to new programs on which we have higher content.","We\u2019re very confident that our technology leadership and broad program participation positions us to benefit long-term from the expanding adoption of electronics and military hardware as well as from growth in military hardware spending in emerging geographies. The commercial aerospace market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased a very strong 26% from prior year and 4% sequentially, due essentially to increased jetliner production as well our expanded content on new airplane platforms.","In addition we continue to benefit form the Ionix acquisition that we completed at the end of last year. While we do expect some normal seasonal moderation in demand in the third quarter we continue to maintain a very positive outlook for the commercial air market in 2014 and beyond. We simply have an excellent and expanding position in this exciting market and we continue to take advantage of the many new technology opportunities that are arising on new airplane platforms.","In particular as our new interconnect technologies are able to resolve an increasing variety of challenges based by our customers who are designing and building next generation planes. We\u2019re confident that our position will continue to strengthen over time.","The industrial market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. We had extremely strong sales growth of 52%, which was supported by the Advanced Sensors acquisition completed at the end of 2014. We had also very strong organic growth of 16%, which was driven by gains in the medical, instrumentation, rail mass transit, heavy equipment as well as oil and gas segments.","On a sequential basis sales increased 8% with growth in virtually all areas of the industrial market that we play in. We\u2019re especially encouraged by the breadth and balance of our industrial growth, which is a clear validation of our long standing strategy of diversification across the broad array of segments within this important market. In addition, I would like to note that we are very pleased to be seeing early in positive signs of the value of our newly acquired sensor portfolio to our industrial customers around the world.","In the third quarter, we expect further growth despite what is a traditionally seasonally softer quarter. As we continue to make excellent progress broadening our technology offering, while increasing our penetration of the many exciting growth areas of the industrial market. The automotive market represented 15% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market also increased a very strong 42% from prior year and 18% organically.","We continued to benefit from the diverse range of new sensor and infotainment automotive products that are provided by Advanced Sensors and Tecvox, the two acquisitions we made at the end of last year. And we also grew our sales organically with new products used in Telematics, in emissions management, as well drive train control application.","On a sequential basis, sales grew by 3% in the automotive market. Automakers continue to incorporate advanced interconnect and sensor products into a wide array of vehicle electronic system, which is really creating great opportunities for our company. In addition, we\u2019re beginning to see interesting opportunities to leverage our interconnect and sensor product range together to create new solutions for automotive customers. Ultimately, we\u2019re confident that our broad high technology offering will enable us to continue to outperform the overall automotive market.","Looking towards the third quarter, we expect the slight increase in sales and what is also typically a more seasonally moderate quarter. And we look forward to an excellent 2014 and beyond for expanding automotive business. The mobile devices market represented 16% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased stronger-than-expected 8% from prior year driven by higher demand for products used essentially in mobile computing devices including both tablets and laptops.","Well we had expected some sequential decline in sales coming into the quarter in fact we were able achieve 6% growth over the first quarter, as we\u2019re able to quickly adjust our production resources in order to capitalize on higher levels of demand across the broad range of devices and customers.","Looking ahead to the second half, we now anticipate a somewhat faster ramp-up of sales in the mobile device market and thus expect overall sales to grow in the range of low-single-digits for the full-year. This increase from our previous expectations of mid-to-high-single-digit decline relates to stronger than expected outlook on a range of existing programs together with some benefit from new product launches.","The mobile device market remains no question extremely dynamic. It is really only through our leading technology offering together with our outstanding and extremely agile team, that we are able to continue to react quickly to capitalize on any opportunities that arise to drive growth in this important market.","The mobile networks market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter and we executed very well and what is just simply an excellent quarter in the mobile networks market. Our sales increased a very strong 26% over prior year and 16% sequentially. While this sales growth was strongest in Asia in fact our sales grew strongly in all our major geographies and was balanced across our wide range of both equipment manufacturers, as well as, our site materials sold direct to operators.","While we continue to anticipate in the second half a somewhat lower level of demand, we maintain a very positive view of the mobile networks market for the full-year 2014. We\u2019re very encouraged that our long-term technology investments across the broadest array of interconnect and antenna products has positioned us strongly to capitalize on accelerating next-generation mobile network deployments and we look forward to continuing to build on this position in the long-term.","The information technology and data communications market represented 16% of our sales in the quarter, as we\u2019d expected sales decreased by roughly 6% from prior year on primarily lower sales of networking related products. Sequentially sales did increase slightly as growth in servers and networks products were partially offset by a moderation of sales of products that are used in storage systems.","Based on our latest input from customers in the IT market, we did not expect any significant increase of demand in the third quarter and accordingly we continue to anticipate that our sales will be flat to slightly down for the full-year in this market. There are clearly some market uncertainties in the IT market, but despite these uncertainties we remain very confident in our long-term position in the IT datacom market.","Due to our leading technology offering, our preferred supplier relationships with a very wide array of OEMs as well as our fast growing presence with direct with datacenter operators and web service providers. The broadband market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter, sales declined slightly from prior year on a moderation of spending in particular from U.S. cable operators an increase as we had expected by around 4% from the first quarter.","While the market environment for traditional bulk cable continues to be challenged and while the competitive pricing environment remains difficult. We are encouraged to see still emerging benefits of our products and customer diversification, which has enabled us bother to grow our range of broadband customers while also offering, what is the more complete interconnect product range.","Moving into the third quarter we expect sale in the broadband market to increase from these levels and we look forward to maintaining a strong position in the broadband market. Well looking back on the second quarter I can just say again that we are just extremely proud of the entire Amphenol organization who has continued to execute well in what remain very challenging and dynamic market environment.","Our superior performance is a direct reflection of Amphenol\u2019s distinct competitive advantages. Our leading technology, our increasing position with customer across the diverse range of markets, our worldwide presence and our lean and flexible cost structure, at end of the day the company\u2019s greatest strength continues to be Amphenol\u2019s high performance culture, which gets reinforced every single day by the company\u2019s agile and entrepreneurial management team.","Turning towards our outlook for the third quarter and the full year, based on constant exchange rates as well as the assuming stable economic condition and in consideration of our strong second quarter performance, as well as current expectation for the reminder of the year we\u2019re very pleased to be able to increase our guidance. We now expect in the third quarter as well as in the full-year of 2014 the following result.","We expect sale in the range of $1,320 billion to $1,350 billion and $5,210 billion to $5,270 billion respectively. And for EPS we expect for the quarter and the year in the range of $1.12 to $1.15 and $4.35 to $4.41 respectively. For the full-year, this guidance now represents sales and EPS growth excluding one-time items of 13% to 14% and 13% 15% respectively a very strong guidance. We\u2019re very encouraged by our strengthening outlook in sales and earnings. Especially, given the many continuing dynamics across the global economy.","Look, the ongoing revolution in electronics continues to create for us tremendous opportunities. And I remain extremely confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to continue to capitalize on these opportunities, both to grow our market position and to expand our profitability. And thereby, to drive continued superior performance for Amphenol.","Thank you very much. And at this time, operator we will be happy to take any questions that they maybe.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Sherri A. Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","","Hi, thank you, Adam and Diana. I wanted to just ask about what is driving the upside to the guidance. When you look at it, just looking through the segments, it seems like maybe mobile devices is driving some of that; you raised your outlook for the second half. I just wanted to get a sense of \u2013 is that the right way to think about it? Which areas are really driving the upside?","R. Adam Norwitt","","Yes, Sherri, thank you very much. I think you put your finger on it mobile devices it certainly of all the markets to won that have the biggest change in terms of our outlook I think the other markets there some small puts and takes, but as I mentioned we certainly are pleased that not only were we able to react quickly to what was essentially some unexpected degree of demand in the second quarter, but we continue to believe that will translate into some higher levels and we had expected in the coming third quarter as well as through the year. And ultimately we go from having felt that market would have been it kind of a mid to high single-digit decline to low single-digit increased on the year-over-year basis. So that no doubt it all of them the most meaningful change in the guidance.","","Sherri A. Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","Okay. And then, Adam, I was hoping to get your thoughts about the demand environment right now. I think in the press release you said there is still a lot of uncertainty, but just wanted to get the sense of \u2013 do you think that things have gotten better? Thank you.","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes, well, thank you very much. I mean I\u2019ve said many times before that I don\u2019t fancy myself at all a macroeconomist. We read the papers and there is no question that there remain still a lot of turbulence in the world no doubt about it some of our markets have a more fair wind behind them if you look at marketplace the automotive market and the industrial market, wireless infrastructure clearly these are markets commercial aerospace and other ones we\u2019re outperforming significantly we believe the end market but the overall markets are performing well.","At the same time, you just have to look at a cross section of earnings releases from various OEMs in the electronics industry to know that not everything is going up into the right. There continues to be a lot of dynamics in the market from every corner and that\u2019s not to mention any kind of geopolitical things that happened or don\u2019t happen in time. Is the overall economy growing at a different pace of GDP? That I have no idea, we are not commissioning studies about this and I actually don\u2019t spend a lot of my time to look at what the GDP trends are that are half a point better or half a point worse.","But we see a lot of opportunities ourselves to capitalize on that change, because at the end of the day when there is dynamics, the agility of how we run the company and the agility of the culture of Amphenol has just so much power to take an advantage of that change. Unexpected things that come from every corner of the electronics industry, these are the things that the Amphenol team is just so capable at taking advantage of and its not taking advantage up here at headquarters that Diana and I kind of directing traffic, it\u2019s more having our general managers around the world, really sensing out in real-time when those dynamics are coming and taking advantage of them. And I think this quarter was a great example of our ability to really find those areas of strength take advantage of them better than maybe others can do and thereby to drive the results that you have seen.","Sherri A. Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","","Thank you.","Diana G. Reardon","Thanks.","R. Adam Norwitt","","Thank you so much, Sherri.","","Operator","","Shawn Harrison from Longbow Research your line is open.","","Shawn M. Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research LLC.","","Hi, congrats on the quarter. Sorry to maybe take a negative tone toward the mobile devices business, but the past two years, as you had positive expectations heading into the back half of the year, some surprises came out. I guess, what is different this year? Is there more content per device that you are seeing? It sounds like you picked up a little bit of share during the second quarter, but maybe just flesh out why this year will be different than prior years?","","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes, no, Shawn it\u2019s not a negative, we don\u2019t take it negatively whatsoever. I think what we have always said is the mobile devices market is extremely dynamic. Just to Sherri\u2019s question, mentioned that we see a lot of dynamics around all the markets, but there is none that are more extreme than mobile devices and we certainly don\u2019t feel that we are oracles in that market in terms of being able to always predict perfectly what happened.","At the same time, our team is just very reactive. And so in the second quarter it\u2019s true, whether that\u2019s picking up share I mean we were able to satisfy customers on a more expedient fashion than others were. And that can carryover going into the second half and we believe it will. We are always prudent in how we look at this market; we are not going to give forecast to the penny in terms of what every rosy outlook that you may reason to media would, so we are always very prudent in this market. I think when we look last year at the change there was a kind of a structural change in the technology of the products and that let us to have a second half that wasn\u2019t what we expected to be.","We don\u2019t think that that\u2019s going to repeated itself, as we talked about that was a one-time shift. And I think, looking at the second half today in the mobile devices market, we feel that there we have strong position whether it\u2019s a gaining share or not it\u2019s already a very strong position.","We\u2019re able to satisfy customers on the ramps that they have around increased demand that they have and that\u2019s serves as well going into the second half. And we\u2019ll see how it goes. Again we \u2013 we\u2019re not perfect at picking where that market goes, but we\u2019re excellent at capitalizing on it regardless.","Shawn M. Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research LLC.","","Very fair. Then, Diana, there is a $600 million piece of debt coming due in the middle of November. What are your expectations in terms of \u2013 will you refinance that? Will you pay it off with the credit facility? How should we think about that piece of debt coming due?","Diana G. Reardon","Sure, I think we have options in that regard we did if you recall, do a debt offering in January of this year in anticipation of the fact that we had the maturity coming up in November and could take advantage of the rates at that time all the rates are still quite low now. So I think we have options, one option certainly would be, it\u2019s refinance it with another bond offering and another option is to use availability under our revolver and we certainly have plenty of room there and I think we\u2019ll make that these vision as we go along here in the next few months.","Shawn M. Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research LLC.","But none of those accretive dynamics are included in guidance currently?","Diana G. Reardon","I think the guidance would assume that we do some sort of refinancing sort of coincidence with the date of the maturity of the bonds offering, but I wouldn\u2019t expect that whatever we do would have a very substantial impact.","Shawn M. Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research LLC.","Got you, thanks so much.","Diana G. Reardon","Sure.","R. Adam Norwitt","","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Steven Fox from Cross Research, your line is open.","Steven B. Fox \u2013 Cross Research LLC","","Thanks. Good afternoon. A couple of questions just on some of the comments you've made so far, Adam. First of all, in the mobile devices market, talking about satisfying your customers quicker than others, can you just expand on what you were referring to and what kind of capabilities you seem to have gained that are giving you that advantage? And then I have a follow-up.","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure. No, I mean, look, it just comes down to \u2013 since it is such a volatile market Steve, that demand can go up and demand can go down very rapidly and dealing with that is not easy. I mean that can mean you got a higher lot of people or you got to do the opposite that can mean you have to be, you have to work in a way that selectable from a capital standpoint from how you setup production lines, I mean there is just a whole host of things and I can tell that I\u2019m not going to go into any detail here, because some of that what I would consider nice proprietary secret sauce about our success, but at the end of the day, it comes down to a mind set.","The culture of Amphenol and organization is probably better than anyone here having covered the company for so long. We come down to general managers in the company, 85 of them are around the world who run these businesses in real-time and they have all the tool at their disposal to make changes without having to go through layers-upon-layers to say can I do this or I cannot do this?","In that market in particular, the customer come to you at noon and they need an answer by 12.30 and if you have to go through some approval process to say \u201cwell I\u2019m going to go hire another 150 people or 500 people or I\u2019m going to buy this machine, I\u2019m going to do this\u201d you have already missed the opportunity, because someone else has given them that answer by 12.30 when they ask that question at noon. And it\u2019s that real-time ability to respond that is essentially in the DNA of our culture and how we are organized that serves us so well on that market.","On the flip side obviously when there are downturn as we've experience in times past, it also serves you well, because you can make quick adjustment to your resources to preserve the bottom line of the company and thereby it makes that business sustainable, because if you get into a mobile device business where you go through these kind of convulsive ups and down with restructuring and plant closing and other things, you are never going to be prepared for when that up side comes, because you are now recovering from that kind of massive change that had to undergo at the last downturn and so because we are able to do that in real-time with general managers who make real decisions everyday, it just makes it a much, much more successful and it makes us more able to deal with that dynamic market.","Steven B. Fox \u2013 Cross Research LLC","","Great. Thanks for that. Then just as a quick follow-up, with regard to the Sensor acquisition, I know you're not going to provide details in terms of financials; but you did mention a couple of times, when you talked about industrial and auto in particular, that you are already seeing opportunities to leverage that portfolio. I was hoping you can give us maybe some examples or just guide us in terms of what you mean and what kind of time frame that would be related to. Thanks.","R. Adam Norwitt","","Sure. Thank you very much, its great question. I\u2019m not going to give specific product examples for obvious competitive reason, but I can just tell you I have personally been over the course of the last quarter to a quite a number of customers, because I wanted to sit in front of those customers and hear it from them how they felt about this and what they saw for the future and I can tell you it\u2019s really universal. They are so pleased to have us coming in as a company with tremendous resources with a tremendous history in particular and high reliability harsh environment product.","I mean we invented most of these harsh environment high reliability products we have been the company for the better part of century who they recognized as that enterprise and then to come in and bringing together that core sensor technology become all the way from the sensor element to the ability to package it, that has been just such a wonderful story to tell and has received just a great reception these are customers in a wide variety of areas, in a wide variety of regions.","Steven B. Fox \u2013 Cross Research LLC","","Great. Thank you very much. Congrats on the quarter.","R. Adam Norwitt","Thanks Steve.","Operator","Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is open.","Matt J. Sheerin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","","Yes, thanks. Hi, Adam and Diana. Question, Adam, regarding the mobile networks business, mobile infrastructure business, where you have had strength and you're talking about a moderation. Is that just based on what you are seeing in terms of programs? And there has been some semiconductor companies out there talking about some push-outs in orders because of a mismatch of components, where there are some component shortages which are gating production. Are you seeing any of that? Or what are some of the things you are seeing in terms of visibility there?","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure, no, thank you very much for the question, I mean look mobile networks has been very positive market for this year and I think we\u2019ve been speaking consistently through the course of the year that we felt that there was probably more first half spending and second half. Now all that being said even with some moderation in our business in mobile networks in the second half that would still be up quite significantly on the year-over-year basis.","The shortages as that you\u2019ve talked about these are directly impacting us I mean most of these shortages that are being talked about around the industry have to do more with semiconductor, but clearly they impact customers and their ability to procure all the components to make the sell-side equipment. And that can have an impact on our business as well and I think if you would ask me at the very beginning of the year I probably would have told you that the second half have a more pronounced downturn than the type of moderation that we\u2019re anticipating today.","So I think there has been some of that stretching out that you mentioned I think that maybe somewhat more magnified in Asia where they\u2019ve just been a few very significant build out so it used a lot of components and some of those components aren\u2019t \u2013 no one can make half of them.","None of those are our components we\u2019re doing a fabulous job to satisfy the increase in demand and we have had really no issue to support what are very significant increases in this business I mean if you think about it on the sequential basis in the mobile networks market of 16% increased that\u2019s pretty significant to deal with in a 90 day period and we\u2019ve had no problem to deal with that.","We look forward and we feel very good about how that market is progressing this year. And one thing, I think I talked about it last quarter, but I just want to reemphasize. This was a very difficult market for the better part of two three years to mobile infrastructure market. It would have been very easy to throw in the towel and just say that is a bad place to be. Let\u2019s not invest, let\u2019s not spend the time, let\u2019s put our people elsewhere, let\u2019s forget about those customers. we didn\u2019t do that and we don\u2019t do that. That\u2019s not how we run our company.","We knew that there was a pent-up demand in that one day, who knows when that one day would be, but that one day there would be a requirement to upgrade the networks and we wanted to make sure that we are well positioned for that. I think this year, we are really realizing the fruits of that confidence and that persistent that we had and continuing to work in that market, which for the better part of three years was not the most fun market to report upon.","Matt J. Sheerin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","","Okay. That's very helpful and just as a follow-up, regarding the mobile devices where you are seeing strength and I know you have got basically three customer segments there, Adam, with mobile computing and smartphones and tablets. And I know that dynamic has changed somewhat for you in terms of the breakdown. Could you give us an idea of where you are seeing the strength? Is it across all those three segments? And give us an idea of the breakdown within those segments of that business?","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure and I unfortunately not going to give you the breakdown strictly and that\u2019s something that certainly we try to keep somewhat closer to our best, relative to customers and competitors, but I can tell you that the strength in the quarter as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we saw more coming out of mobile computing devices on a year-over-year basis coming really from mobile computing devices, which is a range of things, tablets, laptops, eReaders, Ultrabooks, you name it.","On a sequential basis, we actually saw more strength coming out of smartphones and also some on laptops and maybe less out of things like tablet. And looking forward, I think we have a positive outlook really across the board for those on a sequential basis. We look at kind of the second half to the first half where we certainly have a strong expectation for sales growth. I think we would see that growth really across all the areas.","Matt J. Sheerin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, thanks a lot Adam.","R. Adam Norwitt","Thank you, Matt. I appreciated it.","Operator","Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Amit J. Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Perfect, thanks a lot, good afternoon guys. Two questions for me maybe Adams just on the mobile devices side historically you\u2019ve had volatility that\u2019s typically been related to one customer. Do you think with the strength you are seeing, the ramps you are seeing is more than just one OEM are there multiple customer that you are excited about or is just one customer driven ramp?","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure, thanks Amit for the question. I think, we have never said that volatility in that market is related to one customer, I think what I have always said is there are always different leaders in this market over history and we\u2019ve seen many companies cycle through the leadership position and we've dealt with that regardless of who and then we\u2019ve grown our business consistently regardless of that.","As we look towards to strength in our business, I would tell you that it\u2019s certainly not just one customer, we are working with a lot of customers in that market, there is a lot of companies who are establishing what I would call unique niches of strength in various regions and we have great position with all of them.","Amit J. Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC","","Fair enough. Then just as a follow-up, Diana, your conversion margins were not 30% I think this quarter on a sequential basis; you are guiding for better than that I think in September. How much of that is being driven by maybe accretion or integration from the Sensors acquisition versus other tailwinds that you are seeing? And can you sustain this 30% conversion margin beyond June and September really?","Diana G. Reardon","Sure, I think that we as you pointed out we did achieve good conversion margin in Q2, and I think just on a long-term basis the company has a very good track record of strong conversion margins and strong profitability achievement in a pretty diverse set of environments. This particular conversion margin in Q2 was inline with what we expected for the quarter and the guidance in the second half for Q3 and Q4 is also actually consistent with the guidance that we had last quarter, it just on now a higher level of sales.","And the Q2 conversion margin, was largely attributable to just great operating execution in our interconnect business. in the second half of the year, there is some small contribution from, some expected improvement and some of the acquisitions from last year, but I would say largely the improvement in ROS and the stronger conversion margin is just coming out a very strong operation execution on the base business. And the drivers of that strong profitability are really an unrelenting focus on cost, the tension to the top line in terms of which new business we choose to participate in making sure we stay on the high end of technology and therefore can demand appropriate value from a pricing perspective.","So while there is some small contribution, I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re expecting in the second half of the year to have the acquisition reach what we would consider as full potential to be that would dwell beyond 2014.","Amit J. Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Got it. That\u2019s really helpful and congrats on the good quarter guys.","Diana G. Reardon","Thank you.","R. Adam Norwitt","Thanks, Amit.","Operator","Thank you [technical difficulty].","Unidentified Analyst","Hi thanks for taking my question. I\u2019m wondering if you can comment on the M&A environment today and the pipeline and maybe also comment a little bit about product category that you will be going after and you recently acquired center business from GE and I wonder if that\u2019s going to be a particular focus going forward? Thank you.","R. Adam Norwitt","","Yes. No, thank you very much. Obviously M&A has always been for us a real core component of the company\u2019s expansion strategy and we been doing M&A for a long, long time \u2013 certainly well north of decade and decade and half.","During that time period we acquired just so many fabulous company\u2019s and last year and if you take the last two years, we acquired 10 companies in two years and we continue to have just a very vibrant and strong pipeline and we continue to look at M&A not as well we are only going to go in one direction or we going go after this pace in technology but rather we believe there great M&A opportunities across the various markets that we serve.","If you just look back over a two year period when we made those 10 acquisitions those 10 acquisitions were across that have been five or six of our end market. So there was not at all kind of doubling down on one or another one of our markets and one and other of our technologies. ","At the end of the day what we look at from an acquisition as we look at, sort of three simple things number one, first and foremost is management. We look for company\u2019s that have great leadership. Leadership of people who want to continue with the business, and we want them to continue with the business who will operate in the Amphenol organization as the entrepreneurs just like our other 85 general managers do in such a effective passion.","Next we look at technology we want company\u2019s that are really high technology providers people who solve problems for their customers and whatever space they maybe in. And then finally you obviously want company\u2019s who have a complementary market position to our own. And despite the size of Amphenol and the breadth that we operate and there is still just a wider ray of potential acquisition and potential company\u2019s that can fit those kind of three litmus test that we have.","You notice what I didn\u2019t talk about is hurdle rates and things like this because that\u2019s not how we run our acquisition we pay fair prices for things. We certainly look for acquisitions to be accretive in the first year, but ultimately we believe that if you have the right people, and you have right technology and you are doing that in a complementary fashion to our own that\u2019s going to be very, very successful acquisition program. It shown to be such over many, many years and we believe for many years to come and we will continue to be great asset for the company.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks and congrats on the quarter.","R. Adam Norwitt","Thanks so much.","Operator","Mike Wood, Macquarie Research. Your line is open.","Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie Equity Research","Hi, thank you. Also to follow up on the M&A question. How are you currently viewing making additional acquisitions in the sensor market? Do you need to first integrate Advance Sensors or do you have the capacity to make other acquisition in adjacent connect to a products and if you could also comment on the size of sensor opportunities out there in the market.","","R. Adam Norwitt","","Sure, thanks very much Mike. Look we have capacities to make a lot of acquisitions, I think we showed it last Q4, we made four acquisitions in a short time period and we didn\u2019t expand our little headquarters stuff here to do that so there is capacity to make the acquisitions is not a question, so we would not at all restrict ourselves from making another sensor acquisition given the fact that we just acquired GE business just over a half year ago. So we will continue to look for a companies across the board and interconnect and sensors and antennas and other things that we do and we\u2019re the confident that that will bear fruits overtime.","The other thing you asked about size and I mentioned the various criteria that we use for acquisition, size is not one of those criteria. So we have the capacity and we have to wherewithal to buy companies really of any size subject to the fact that they fit in our other criteria of having good people and great technology and I think that we have a wonderful financial capacity to do those acquisitions and to the extensive there are companies of a greater size we would not shy away from pursuing them if they were the appropriate companies to buy.","Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie Equity Research","","Okay. Could you also comment on how much of your cable business is now the specialty growth that you were pursuing versus the more commoditized product and is that pricing pressure limited to certain areas of that cable business?","R. Adam Norwitt","We don\u2019t break it down by product specifically, again competitive reasons are important to be sensitive to here, but what I can tell you is both with the Holland acquisition that we made a couple of years ago as well as our internal development efforts, we have a much broader array of products today beyond just cable and reels that we sold for so many years and one can imagine that the growth profile of the business would not be surprising for you to learn that those kind of products grow at somewhat faster rates than do the bulk cable product.","Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie Equity Research","","Okay, thank you.","","R. Adam Norwitt","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Jim Suva from Citigroup. Your line is open.","","James D. Suva \u2013 Citigroup","","Thank you and congratulations to you and your team at Amphenol. I have one question for Adam and then one question for Diana. So just taking them in that order, Adam, great results, but when we do look at the details underneath it, I think there is still a few little areas of potential improvement and want to see if you are aware of them, or if you are seeing that there is the potential to improve on it, or what your course is. Not specifically regarding the cable products. I believe it is about 7% of your company, so not a big part. Most of the questions previously asked were on the other bigger parts. But on the cable parts, you are hitting multiyear high in sales levels, but your profitability is the opposite direction, not hitting multiyear highs. So is that more excess industry capacity?","Is that more pricing by competitors? Is it product misplacement? Or how come we are not seeing, with you hitting multiyear high in sales there, not better profitability? Then for Diana, on the dividend increase, I believe and I personally feel that M&A and organic growth, I guess organic growth first and M&A second is the best use of cash. So to see your dividend increase, is that just simply you want to have a rule of thumb of a 1% dividend yield going forward? Or is that the M&A opportunities are less? Or how should we think about the increase in dividend?","R. Adam Norwitt","","Yes, Jim, thank you for those obviously two excellent questions. Relative to cable, I mean I just talked about our strategy in cable, which is really to work to diversify our product types. I have spoken many times about the fact the cable environment, the pricing environment has been a very challenging environment for a quite sometime it continues to be a very challenging environment.","We continue to be a company that is very disciplined and we will remain disciplined in our cable pricing. But when you have a market which is so concentrated, we are also not just going to let the market totally fall through our fingers. So, we will always let the leaders in that market set the price and we will follow that. As I have always said, by the time the sun has set we don\u2019t let a price increase fall through our fingers.","But at the same time you mentioned it very well, it has become a much smaller portion of the business it\u2019s important part of the business to be in the broadband market per say. Because, we have our cable product segment, but the broadband market remains one of the most important areas in terms of delivering high speed data to customers home. And so we remain very committed to that market even if the cable products, margins are certainly lower than we would like and you can bet that our team will continue to work towards getting those margins up.","Diana G. Reardon","And in terms of the second question, Jim, I think that there certainly has been no change relative to the company strategy regarding capital deployment. And we had a very consistent strategy for many years now. And from a prioritization perspective, certainly while we do prioritize the acquisition program in terms of using the financial strength, we also feel that a flexible and balanced approach is equally important.","And I think if you would look at the historical pattern for the company, whether you look at 2013 or you look at back over the last five years. We\u2019ve typically about half of our free cash flow and I think we just generated something along $2.6 billion, $2.7 billion over the last five years and free cash flow about half of that is going to fund the acquisition program, which has been a very successful program and added a lot of value for the company and about in the other of that about is gone back to shareholders. And that return of capital to shareholders has been a balance of stock buyback and the dividend which really didn\u2019t get 20 real amount until 2013.","So the dividend is very much a part of the strategy of having flexible and balanced approach on increase that we announce, brings yield up to about a 1% yield. In the context of the approach that we have for that balance, we think that that is an appropriate level for the company, but the prioritization of the capital deployment has not changed. And certainly the acquisition program is still, from our perspective as a management team, the best source of long-term growth and profitability enhancement for the company.","James D. Suva \u2013 Citigroup","","Thank you. Congratulations again to you and your team at Amphenol.","Diana G. Reardon","Thank you.","R. Adam Norwitt","Thank you very much Jim.","Operator","Thank you. James Kisner from Jefferies. Your line is open.","James M. Kisner \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just a quick clarification. Did you guys buy any companies in the quarter? I just saw on your cash flow statement you spent $10 million on an acquisition. I don't think I heard you say anything about that. Maybe that is a prior announced acquisition.","Diana G. Reardon","We had a couple of payments that related to some previous acquisitions and we had a very small acquisition \u2013 I call more of a vertical integration of a very small company that didn't rise to a level that we would be talking about.","James M. Kisner \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","","Great. And separately, just on the military piece, I am not sure if I heard you guys right that you said you are seeing some growth on hardware spend in emerging geographies. I guess I had always thought of this business as pretty much a domestic and Western business. I just want to understand your exposures there and what particular geographies you might be \u2013 you maybe exposed to in military, other than the U.S.. I guess I am just wondering longer-term, if there's conflicts around the world, could you potentially see some benefit from that? Thanks.","R. Adam Norwitt","","Well, thank you very much, look we\u2019re not trying to capitalize on world instability, so let me say that very much at the frontend here, we certainly hope that our conflicts around the world and we do our little piece to make sure that\u2019s not the case. But relative to emerging geographies, I have talked about this actually for quite some time. When we go back to the military market as the various U.S. and European driven conflicts we are winding down.","I have talked a lot about the fact that we continue to see an offset to that overall reduction in the military spending environment from two areas. One is the expansion of electronics in the military. And we see that very much so, much more electronic content even if it\u2019s among a lower pool of spending and then in the second is those are merging geographies who continue to invest and continue to spend money on upgrading their military.","Obviously as an American company, we are not going to do business with certain geographies they are places like China and Iran and obviously as the U.S. company you don\u2019t participate with those are all hand off, but there are a lot of countries around the world were you do work and you do work with them and we have worked with them for many, many, many years. I mean we have been in India for the better part of 43-years as the leader in the Indian military hardware.","We have been in Israel for around essentially the history of Israel and history of Amphenol, places like Brazil, places like Malaysia, Singapore you name it, there are many, many places around the world who are actually increasing their degree of military spending and at the same time increasing the electronic component of that through \u2013 in order to modernize their militaries and that\u2019s something that we continue to see, we continue to have excellent presence in many of those place.","Many of those are also working through U.S. manufactures of equipment or European manufactures of equipment. So we get some benefit just through the traditional U.S. and European defense manufactures, but we also have a lot of presence direct with indigenous companies in all of those regions. And I think the repetition that we have as really the world leader in this space. The technology trends that are in this space also serves us very, very well as we looked to capitalize on whatever growth opportunities there can be from these emerging geographies.","James M. Kisner \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","","Great thank you go much.","R. Adam Norwitt","","Thank you","Operator","[Technical difficult] Amitabh Passi from UBS. Your line is open.","Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS","","Hi, thank you. Adam, I had a couple of questions on a couple of your key markets. First one, automotive, 18% year-over-year organic growth. I think unit production growth is probably in the low, maybe mid single-digits. I think we all understand the content with story, but I wanted to understand: are there other factors that play here? Maybe you are seeing a firmer pricing environment, maybe you are gaining share. Or do you think we have hit an inflection on just the rate at which content is growing in automotives that continues to propel this segment at a pretty stable rate, particularly over the past few quarters?","R. Adam Norwitt","","Yes. It\u2019s a great question Amithab I mean we\u2019re just very proud of the progress that we've made in the automotive market. We just take historical perspective for Amphenol you may recall if we go back in a five, five and half years ago automotive was I think Q1 of 2009 it was like 6% of our sales and now here it is 15% of our sale and that growth has come really from two parallel initiatives. One is to develop new products that can capitalize on the expansion of electronic functionality in the car. And so we've done that just so well getting in front of exhaust management, drive a train, onboard electronics, Telematics, infotainment, you name it, where we work very carefully and very closely with customers at all tiers in the automotive world to really help them to enable new systems.","It wasn\u2019t necessarily that were taking share out of someone else\u2019s hand, it was that we were helping to enable new functionalities in the car with our existing capabilities to make strong interconnect products. And sometimes these weren\u2019t even just simple piece-part components, but they were complex interconnect systems and that something from organic standpoint that we just done an outstanding job of. ","And then in parallel, we made some excellent acquisitions over that same time period, where we have really broadened the range of products that we sell into cars around the world. And then, once we make those acquisitions but they don\u2019t just joined the company and sort of stay in the static position forever, we work with them to cross sell into customers, to work with them to help to enable next-generation systems bringing together the technologies within our automotive group.","And I think those efforts all collectively have resulted in us achieving the results that you\u2019ve seen for several years running and including this quarter I think 18% growth, no matter how you slice it, is outperforming the market organically by probably quite a wide margin. And we believe that we have just laid a great platform here. We are clearly not the leader in this space, nor do we aspire to be the leader in this space. But we want to be a stronger participant who works very much in those high value, high technology in new electronics application.","Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS","","And then just as a quick follow-up on your IT datacom segment. I think for the past couple of quarters, you had also started to talk about trying to diversify your customer base, maybe serving some of the cloud service providers directly. Where are we in that process? When do you think it starts to move the needle and maybe serve as an offset to some of the pressure you are seeing with your existing OEM customer base?","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure. No, it\u2019s an excellent question and certainly this has been a big initiative for us for a quite some time. I can tell you we have in our company a lot of operations who work with, what I would call service providers. And that is a really unique asset that we have in the company understanding how service providers work as opposed to how OEMs work.","They are extremely different in what they care about, what their priorities are, what the predictability of their spending patterns are. But I think we have a great head start on that because of our kind of cultural awareness how to work with those companies and our ability to kind of tack differently and work with those customers when we have been so accustomed to working with the OEMs. The IT market is very dynamic space. You just got to look at few of the earnings releases that have come out recently and then you compare that to some of the earnings releases of service providers and look at the capital that they are spending there is a massive disconnect that is happening in that market.","And so there is no question that the success in the future is going to be tied very much to our success in broadening the customer base. And I can tell you that we are doing a fabulous job of that so far. It\u2019s early days because I think the market is in flux somewhat. So is that transition happened how the service providers, to what degree do they take control of certain things? To what degree do they cede control to the traditional OEMs that whole lay of the land, if you will, is still very much in flux. But however it shakes out, we are going to be well positioned for the long-term.","","Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS","Okay, excellent. Thank you.","R. Adam Norwitt","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Mark Delaney \u2013 Goldman Sachs Inc.","","Thanks very much. I appreciate the opportunity to ask a question. On mobile devices, can you talk about to what extent you have been able to capitalize on strong growth of 4G handsets in emerging markets?","R. Adam Norwitt","No, no, that\u2019s an excellent question. I think we don\u2019t talk specifically about individual products, but no doubt that next-generation whether that\u2019s called 3G, 4G, LTE, TD-LTE, I am sure there\u2019s other acronyms that I am missing here. Those are clearly driving some of the growth in the overall space. I think we \u2013 I mentioned in the past many times that when we working the mobile device market, we work there with a very simple framework, which is we are going to participate in those devices where there is value in our product and usually that translates into where there is value in the hardware. I think what we have started to see.","In handsets in particular is certain companies who have realized that it is just not enough to put either an Android or a Windows operating system in your phone and sell it kind of in the blank box. And that there is differentiation happening, competitive differentiation happening among certain customers and that includes customers in less developed or emerging markets.","China is one place. Whether China is emerging anymore, I don\u2019t know, but certainly that one place where there is a lot of competition happening and where there are kind of domestic companies not the global name brands, who are competing on the performance, the functionality, the use of the product relative to hardware not just the software. And those are areas, which have to potential at least to create for us an opportunity to expand our position.","So I think from that standpoint, long-winded answer to the question, I would say: Yes, that\u2019s create an opportunity. Whether it is just 4G that I wouldn\u2019t be so sure of. But if there are new devices with new functionality, then no doubt about it that can create for us an opportunity.","Mark Delaney \u2013 Goldman Sachs Inc.","Understood. Thank you for that. For a follow-up question, I am hoping you can elaborate a little bit more on some of the order trends. You were already discussing the mobile networks, and if you could discuss any differences you are seeing there between connectors and antennas, and then what some of the underlying drivers of the trends are between units, pricing, or increased content per system.","R. Adam Norwitt","","Sure. No, I mean, I\u2019m not going to get into specifics about the various products that we sell into that market, but I can tell you that we have a very broad offering, and I think, I mentioned in my early remarks that we\u2019re very pleased with the growth across-the-board, whether that is our direct sales of interconnect products to OEMs, our sales to operators the both interconnect products as well as antennas.","We are very pleased with the contributions from all of those, and I think we have a very balanced business across both the products as well as the channel, the ultimate channel through which we sell our product and I think we have stronger order trends across-the-board. The thing that is unique this year in the mobile infrastructure market, besides just that the overall capital spending seems to be more favorable than it has been in several years past, is that the fact that you are seeing growth and not insignificant growth on a global basis. Not just concentrated in one or another of the various geographies.","And I think that is something that is unique. I personally believe it is just because of consumer pressure, that they want those devices to have fast video with no latency. Now that they have TVs sitting in their hands, they want to able to use this TVs that are in their hands; and that is putting a lot of pressure on operators on a global basis to be competitive. And when you have one operator in one place just as well now I got the fastest LTE or 4G or whatever you call it, immediately the other ones got to react or else they are going to start to lose customers and its expenses for them when they lose this customers.","So, I think that has been a real tipping point with prevalence of the devices that now drives overall those investments. And as it comes back to just our position, we have just an outstanding and very broad technology position on interconnect products, on antennas, on cable assemblies, on connectors, RF, fiber optics, high speed you name it, the full range of products that are used in these very advanced new system.","Mark Delaney \u2013 Goldman Sachs Inc.","Thank you very much.","Diana G. Reardon","","Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Wamsi Mohan \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Adam, you mentioned last quarter that you expected sequential ramps in the back half in mobile devices. Clearly that is proving out to be a lot stronger now. So would you characterize that the upside is coming from upside demand forecasts from programs that you were prior expected to drive that sequential strength? Or would you say these are completely new wins in products that you did not expect 90 days ago? And I have a follow-up.","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure. No, thank you very much for the question, Wamsi. I just very simply would say it comes from a combination of all of that I think that we have better demand on existing, and we have better expectations for some new product. And that\u2019s I think a very simple answer to the question.","Wamsi Mohan \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks, Adam. Can you remind us how much of your revenue goes through distribution now? And is there a plan to change your go-to-market for the sensor products? Are the system designers and buyers the same for the interconnect and sensor products or you need to built some infrastructure and change go-to-market for that? Thanks.","R. Adam Norwitt","","Sure. No, it\u2019s an excellent question. First, relative to distribution, it is about 12% of our sales goes through distribution. We have no tops-down initiative to say. Well, now we got to change all of our channels relative to sensors or we got that take full advantage of whatever strength that we have. Obviously, to the extent that we have some customers or distributors who are interested now in the sensor products that we can offer simply because they are now part of Amphenol. We are not going to led those opportunities go by the wayside. So we will take advantage of them.","Relative to your question about inside the customers, whether that is always the same person, as I mentioned earlier, I have gone to a number of customers since we have made the acquisition strong customers that we had previously as well as customers with whom the Advanced Sensors business is strong. And I would tell you that it depends. I think there are some customers where it is not at all the same people.","And I think in general the engineers are not the same people, but ultimately from a procurement and strategic procurement standpoint, it usually all ends up at one top of a pyramid. The thing that I have seen and alluded to it earlier is even those engineers who, let\u2019s say are just sensor engineer or conversely are just an interconnect engineer, it appears from my conversations with them that one of the greatest frustration those individual engineers have is the challenges that they face with the sort of corresponding technology.","So in other words you have an interconnect engineer who is having to design things for a system that incorporates a sensor, he doesn\u2019t really understand that sensor. Now that you can come in as a company like we now can and sell that together with our sensors engineer, our interconnect engineer, you can really solve the big problem for that person because interestingly, a lot of our customer are really big companies and they don\u2019t necessarily communicate internally as well as we can necessarily communicate internally.","So you can help to actually bridge some of the gap in those challenges across the two portfolios. We have seen the same in years past. Antenna engineers don\u2019t tend to be connector engineers and vice versa, and that has served us extremely well as we have gone to customers to be able to solve that the comprehensive system problem that they face.","Wamsi Mohan \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","","Thanks a lot Adam.","R. Adam Norwitt","","Well, thank you very much, Wamsi, and I think we have no further questions. So I would like to just take this opportunity to thank you all again for spending your time with us here today and hope it is not too late to wish that you have at least some degree of rest this summer for all of you on the phone today.

[Operator Instructions] At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Ms. Diana Reardon. Ma'am, you may begin.","Diana G. Reardon","Thank you. Good afternoon. My name is Diana Reardon, and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we'd like to welcome you all to our second quarter call.","Q2 results were released this morning. I'll provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question-and-answer session.","The company closed the second quarter with sales of $1.136 billion and EPS of $0.95, meeting the high end of our guidance and achieving a new EPS record. Sales were up 7% in both U.S. dollars and local currencies compared to Q2 of 2012. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency effects, sales in Q2 2013 were up 3% versus last year. Sequentially, sales were up 5%, both in U.S. dollars and organically, from Q1.","Breaking down sales into our 2 major components, our Cable business, which comprised 8% of our sales in the quarter, was up 19% from last year as a result of a 2012 acquisition. The Interconnect business which comprised 92% of our sales, was up 6% from last year as a result of both increased demand and prior-year acquisitions. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.","Operating income was $224 million in Q2. Operating margin was 19.7%, up from 19.4% last year and from 19.2% last quarter, a very good conversion margin on incremental sales of over 24% from last year and over 30% from last quarter.","From a segment standpoint, in the Cable segment, margins were 13.8% and comparable to prior year levels. In the Interconnect business, margins were 22%, up from 21.6% last year. The year-over-year Interconnect operating margin improvement primarily reflects the positive impacts of higher volume and cost-reduction actions.","We're very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement of 19.7%, and we continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and culture of cost control allows us to react in a fast and flexible manner, thereby constantly adjusting the business to maximize profitability in what continues to be a very dynamic environment. Through the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remain fully committed to driving enhanced performance.","Interest expense for the quarter was $15.6 million compared to $15.1 million last year, reflecting higher average debt levels from the company's stock buyback program. Other income was $3 million, up from $2.6 million last year, primarily as a result of higher interest income on higher levels of cash and short-term cash investments.","The company's effective tax rate was approximately 26.8% in the quarter, the same as last year. For the full year 2013, excluding the effect of onetime items, we currently expect a tax rate of approximately 26.3% compared to a full year effective tax rate of 26.6% in the year 2012.","Net income in the quarter was approximately 14% of sales, and earnings per share increased 10%, to $0.95 from $0.86 last year, a strong performance. Orders for the quarter were $1.177 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio in Q2 of approximately 1.04:1.","The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was a strong $180 million in Q2 or approximately 117% of net income. The company continues to target and achieve cash flow from operations in excess of net income.","The company had strong working capital performance in the quarter. Inventory declined 1% from March and was down 5 days, to 81 days at the end of June. Accounts receivable was $906 million at the end of June, and days sales outstanding declined 2 days, to 71 days. Accounts payable stood at $447 million at the end of June, and from a day's perspective was also down 2 days from last quarter.","Cash flow from operations of $180 million, along with option exercise proceeds of $41 million and borrowings under the company's revolving credit facility of $95 million, were used primarily for net capital expenditures of $36 million in the quarter, the purchase of 1.2 million shares of the company's stock for $96 million, the acquisition of DC Electronics for $44 million, dividend payments of $17 million, and an increase in cash and cash investments of $121 million in the quarter. At the end of June, the company had approximately 7.5 million shares remaining under its stock repurchase program, which expires in January of 2015.","At the end of June, cash and short-term investments were $1.143 billion, the majority of which is held outside the U.S. And debt at the end of June was $1.783 billion, leaving net debt at approximately $640 million at the end of the quarter.","Borrowings and availability under our revolving credit facility were $594 million and $406 million at the end of June, respectively. The company's leverage and interest coverage ratios remain very strong at 1.7x and 17x, and EBITDA in the quarter was $273 million.","On July 1, the company amended and extended its revolving credit facility, increasing the size of the facility to $1.5 billion, extending the maturity date 2 years to July 2018, and lowering certain fees. The company's current availability under the amended facility is approximately $906 million.","In addition, in the end of the quarter, the company's Board of Directors has approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on the company's common stock, from $0.105 to $0.20 per share, increasing the yield to about 1%. The increase is effective for payments beginning in October.","From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance. Before I turn the call over to Adam, I'd like to make a few comments relative to the assumption included in our guidance. The midpoint of our sales guidance has been revised down from $4.618 billion to $4.515 billion, a reduction of approximately $100 million or 2%. This reduction relates to a change in our expectation for demand in the wireless device market, from a mid-single digit growth in our prior guidance to a decline of just under 10% in our current guidance. This is partially offset by a contribution from the recent acquisition of about $20 million.","Our previous guidance anticipated, for the mobile device market, a significant increase in demand in the second half of 2013, relating both to new product introductions and higher production forecast for certain mobile computing platforms, some of which were introduced to the market in late 2012. Current customer forecasts indicate lower demand levels than previously expected in the second half of 2013, resulting in minimal lift in demand in the second half over first half levels. In comparing demand to prior year levels, we now see lower demand from new product launches, as well as some impact of a further acceleration in the shift in mobile computing products towards WiFi-only enabled devices. Our guidance also reflects a reduction in our 2013 full year effective tax rate from 26.8% to 26.3%. This compares to a full year tax rate in 2012 of 26.6%. We anticipate the rate reduction will be effective in the third quarter and therefore, reflected the lower rate in our guidance.","The adjustment to sales and the adjustment to the tax rate result in a change in the midpoint for 2013 EPS guidance from $3.81 to $3.76 for 2013, a reduction of about 1.5%.","Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends.","R. Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much, Diana, and I'd like to add my welcome to all of you on the phone today. As Diana mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter, and then discuss the trends and progress that we've had in our served markets. Finally, I'll make a few comments on our outlook for the third quarter and the full year, and then we'll have time at the end for questions and answers.","With respect to the second quarter, we achieved record earnings per share at the high end of our guidance, with revenues increasing a strong 7% from prior year and 5% sequentially. We're very pleased with these results, especially given the significant market uncertainties that are still present in the global economy. Diana mentioned orders reached $1,177,000,000, representing a book-to-bill of 1.04:1 and supporting our higher expected sales levels in the second half. Profitability was also strong in the quarter, as we generated higher than normal sequential conversion margins, leading to a further expansion of our industry-leading operating margins to 19.7%. I continue to be very proud of our agile, entrepreneurial organization as we continue to capitalize on the many opportunities that are created by the electronics revolution and continue, most importantly, to demonstrate the discipline and drive necessary to drive strong operating performance for the company.","We're also very pleased that, in the quarter, we've made further progress in our acquisition program with the addition of DC Electronics at the end of June. DC Electronics is a U.S.-based manufacturer of harsh-environment interconnect assemblies for the industrial market, with annual sales of approximately $40 million. This excellent acquisition builds upon our leading offering of high-technology interconnect products to the many diverse segments of the industrial market, including, in particular, the heavy equipment, medical and semiconductor test areas. Very importantly, this acquisition is also consistent with our long-standing strategy to find and acquire complementary companies with strong management, leading technology and excellent market presence. And as we welcome this outstanding new team to Amphenol, we remain very confident and committed that our acquisition program will continue to create significant value for the company in the future.","Turning to the trends and progress in our served markets, I just want to say first that our market diversity remains a significant asset for the company, and the Amphenol management team continues to devote tremendous efforts towards our ongoing market, customer application and product diversification.","Turning to the individual markets, the military market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market were down slightly from both prior year and prior quarter, as growth in airframe, communications and ordinance-related applications was offset by an overall reduced demand environment in other segments of the military market. We continue to see significant conservatism in the purchasing behavior of defense equipment makers due largely to budgetary restrictions in many countries. Nevertheless, there continues to be a very high level of design activity targeted at creating new electronic functionalities in military equipment, combined with continued growth opportunities in developing geographies. We expect demand in the military market to remain at or slightly below these levels in the third quarter. Nevertheless, we believe our technology leadership and broad program participation positions us to benefit long-term from the expanding adoption of electronics in military hardware.","The commercial aviation market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased a very strong 23% from prior year and 4% sequentially on increased jet liner production, as well as due to our expanded content on new airplane platforms. We continue to expand our participation in these next-generation airliners, which are requiring ever-higher technology solutions to enhance fuel efficiency, drive better performance and improve overall passenger experience. In fact, we have a stronger position across this range of applications than ever before, as our new interconnect technologies are resolving a wide variety of challenges that are faced by customers designing and building these next-generation platforms. While we would normally expect a seasonal moderation of demand in the third quarter, we actually expect sales to increase in the next quarter, and we continue to have a very positive outlook for the commercial air market in 2013 and beyond.","The diversified industrial market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter. Sales decreased approximately 6% from prior year, as growth in factory automation, heavy equipment, medical and rail mass transit was offset by reduced demand from customers in the energy-related segments. Sales did increase 5% sequentially, with growth in virtually all of our segments. We believe that this second quarter moderation of demand in the energy-related products represents only a pause in activity. And we continue to look forward to strong momentum in that important segment in which we have an expansive and truly leading position.","Overall, we expect the industrial market to strengthen in the third quarter from these levels, as we benefit from the new acquisition of DC Electronics and as we continue to make excellent progress, broadening our technology offering while increasing our penetration of the many exciting growth areas of this industrial market.","The automotive market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the automotive market increased a very strong 20% from prior year and 7% sequentially, as we participated strongly in the increase in production volumes of vehicles, which are incorporating a wide variety of new electronics, while also realizing further benefits from our unique new design wins. We're excited to see the results of our continued expansion into new high-technology automotive applications, which has been really the result of our several acquisitions completed over the last 2 years, together with our long-term efforts at internal product development.","We see automakers continuing to incorporate electronics into new and expanding areas of performance management, fuel efficiency and passenger infotainment, all of which serve to create excellent growth opportunities for Amphenol. We expect sales in the automotive market to remain essentially at these levels in the third quarter, as our continued progress on new platforms offsets what would otherwise be traditional summertime seasonality. And we look forward to continued long-term progress in this very exciting market.","The mobile devices market represented 17% of our sales. Sales increased 4% from prior year, as lower sales of products incorporated into mobile computing devices was offset by slightly higher sales onto new smartphones and some ultrabooks. Sales declined slightly from Q1 levels, as overall customer demand did not reach the level that we had expected. While our mobile device customers had previously anticipated a significant increase in demand in the second half of this year, current customer forecasts indicate lower-than-expected demand levels, and thus, a minimal increase in our sales for the second half compared to the first half. Diana has already mentioned several of the near-term dynamics that we're seeing in this market. While these factors are certainly having a significant impact on our 2013 growth, we continue to see good long-term future growth opportunities for Amphenol due to our very strong and diversified technology position in this important, and no doubt, extremely dynamic end market.","The mobile networks market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in that market increased a very robust 12% from prior year and 9% sequentially, primarily due to stronger sales of our broad array of interconnect and antenna products for sell-side installations. We're very encouraged to have now realized 3 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth in the mobile infrastructure market, as operators in many geographies have increased their spending on LTE and other next-generation networks. And more importantly, our team has been very successful at expanding and upgrading our range of high-technology products for the mobile networks market, with the result that we are now better positioned than ever before with a diverse set of wireless OEMs and operators around the globe.","Although we expect sales in the third quarter to moderate seasonally on a typical pause in build-out activities, we expect the further ramp up of activities later in the year as operators continue to upgrade their networks and add more capacity. And accordingly, we now expect to achieve growth in this market for the full year 2013, something that we haven't seen for a couple of years.","The Information Technology and Data Communications market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased 6% from prior year, led by growth in our products incorporated into servers, but with strength as well in storage-related products. Sequentially, our sales increased a greater-than-expected 15%, as we gained further momentum with an array of our high-technology new products, most notably our leading edge suite of high-speed products. As our customers are continuing to strive for new levels of equipment performance in order to handle a dramatic expansion of data traffic, our pipeline of new design opportunities with our next generation high-speed products continues to strengthen. We are working intensively with many customers to help them design their new systems that can handle the big data revolution together with the tremendous expansion of video traffic that they are facing, all while, at the same time, reducing power consumption of those devices. We expect demand to remain at these higher levels in the third quarter, and we continue to have a positive long-term outlook for the IT Datacom market.","The Broadband Communications market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased a very strong 24% from prior year as we benefited further from last year's acquisition of Holland Electronics. Sales increased 7% from the prior quarter on increased demand from both domestic and international cable operators. We continue to be very encouraged to see the emerging benefits of our product and customer diversification, which when combined with the Holland acquisition, have enabled us to grow our range of broadband customers while offering a more complete interconnect product offering. Despite some enhanced price competition that we're seeing in both [ph] cable, we are seeing further opportunities to sell a more diversified portfolio of products to our cable television, satellite and telco customers. We expect a slight increase in sales in the third quarter, and we look forward to continued positive momentum in the broadband market.","So in summary, with respect to the second quarter, I'm extremely proud of the Amphenol organization, as we continue to execute well in what is, no doubt, a very challenging and dynamic market environment. Our superior performance is a direct reflection of the company's distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our growing and broad position with customers across a diverse range of marketplaces, our presence around the globe, a lean and very flexible cost structure, and most importantly, an agile entrepreneurial management team who react quickly to whatever changes arise in the marketplace.","Now turning to our outlook, as we've mentioned, there continues to be significant market uncertainties in the global economy, in particular, within the mobile devices market, which both Diana and I highlighted earlier. Accordingly, and based on constant exchange rates and normal seasonal patterns, we now expect for the third quarter and for the full year 2013 the following results. We expect sales in the range of $1,120,000,000 to $1,145,000,000 and $4,490,000,000 to $4,540,000,000, respectively. And we expect earnings per share in the range of $0.95 to $0.98 and $3.73 to $3.79, respectively.","For the full year, this outlook represents sales and earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% and 7% to 9%, respectively. While these expected full year sales levels are certainly lower than our prior guidance, we are very pleased to have an outlook that reflects both a step-up in sales in the second half, as well as a strong continuation of our industry-leading profitability.","We continue to see tremendous opportunities for Amphenol as a result of the ongoing revolution in electronics. And I remain extremely confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to continue to capitalize on these opportunities, to grow our market's position, and to expand our profitability, and thereby, to drive continued superior performance for Amphenol.","With that operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there may be.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a question and a follow-up from me. When I think about the reduction of the 2013 forecast, it's about $120 million on an organic basis. I just want to make sure it's all of the -- the entire $120 million softness is coming from the wireless devices segments, or is it more broad based? And maybe we can just talk about organic trends, excluding wireless devices. Do you think that's gotten better over the last 90 days from your perspective or more of a steady state?","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes, Amit, thank you very much for the question. Yes, indeed, that number that you quoted, the $120 million organically, is really all a credit to the wireless devices market. We would normally see a very significant step-up in the second half, and that's not what we see today based on all what Diana and I have said. Relative to the organic trends in the other markets, we don't see any dramatic changes in those organic trends, I think I mentioned, relative to each of the markets what we're seeing going forward, and we feel that our position in all those markets is extremely strong. And we see continued potential across all those markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Fair enough. And then if I could maybe just follow-up, in the devices market, it sounds like your issues may be more tablet-centric when you talk about WiFi devices versus 3G and 4G devices, I assume. Is the issue more related to one customer, or is it fairly broad based across the multiple customers you guys have there? And is there any program losses or anything that you walked away from that makes the back half guidance come lower?","R. Adam Norwitt","Well, thank you very much for that question. I mean let me just first reflect on our strategy, which is a very consistent strategy in that market. We have always said and I have always said that, that is a market where we will participate when there's value. And we continue to operate that same way. We have very high-technology products, and we operate in really the high-technology part of that marketplace. So as we've seen the shifts, which certainty are shifts that came a little bit faster than we expected towards these WiFi only devices, those, no doubt, is more a tablet-related phenomenon, where we have participated in a wide range of tablets. It is not a single-customer phenomenon, far from it. But at the same time, we don't participate necessarily in the low end of the market. When you look at the dynamics in that market, there has been more growth related to smaller form factor tablets, white-box-related tablets, these kind of no-name products, where by virtue of the price that those products are sold, naturally, the content available in those products is less. I think this dynamic also with WiFi and 3G is a dynamic that is related also to the fact that WiFi networks become more prevalent. People are replacing their desktop computer sometimes with a tablet, where they don't really need that 3G functionality. That being said, there is always a demand and will be continually a demand for products that have that functionality that we can offer with our high-technology products. We see tremendous opportunities still for the future. We believe we have good growth potential in that market for the future as we look forward to it. It is a market that has always changed. And we have seen always change in that market, short life cycles, new consumer preferences. And what we are so proud of in that market is that we have an organization who is extremely nimble. And you look at that, you look at the margins that we have as a total company, you look at the confirmation that we have of those margins going forward, this is not a question where that change has a kind of a cataclysmic impact on the performance of Amphenol. Rather, our organization is out there hunting with all customers in the market, where there is the value for us with our high-technology antenna products, our interconnect products, our mechanism products, wherever they -- whatever they may be, and we continue to see good opportunities there. The fact is this is something that is happening this year. It is what it is in many respects, but we believe there is strong potential going forward in that marketplace.","Operator","And our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Adam, we've seen organic growth rates moderate across the industry. Arguably, you guys have done a better job than others, but are we hitting some level of technology maturation, such that the organic growth rates over the next 5 years are going to be significantly different, maybe mid-single digit versus a double digit over the past decade?","R. Adam Norwitt","Wamsi, thank you very much for the question. Look, let me just say this. We continue to believe Amphenol has a strong, strong position in this market. And we continue to target growth far in excess of the market, and we believe that we have done that and will continue to do that. The global economy is continuing to be a very uncertain environment. Do I believe that, that is an environment that is going to perpetuate over the long term? Personally, I don't, but I am not an economist. I'm not here to prognosticate about the next 5 years. What I will tell you is that we continue to see a tremendous array of opportunities for electronics. And to what extent does the overall economy drive spending patterns, whether with operators, with enterprises, with governments, whatever, that is a different question. But relative to the expansion of electronics in all of the markets that we serve, we certainly do not believe that, that kind of recent lower-growth macro environment is one that should continue or would necessarily continue. We see a lot of opportunities, Wamsi, for that. The fact is when you have all the uncertainties in the world today, discussions about Europe, discussions about America, whatever, I think that has impacted a lot of the buying patterns, whether that is operators, whether that is enterprises, governments and whatnot. But I believe that there is still tremendous pent-up demand. I mean, look only at the IT market, where data rates are expanding so dramatically. You hear numbers 50%, 60% increase on the annual basis of the amount of data that is coursing through that network, while meanwhile, IT budgets are up, 1%, 2%. And it's rare to find an IT hardware OEM that is growing. And there are recent results that have confirmed that. Well, we are growing in that market. And we're growing in that market because we have new technologies that are allowing our customers to continue to make more with less, allow them to process more data through systems with the same cost, allow them to reduce their operating expenses because of lower power consumption. And I think, so long as we can continue to have that focus, which we have across the company, on driving enabling technologies, we will be able to drive superior growth for the company.","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","As a quick follow-up, what percentage of revenues within mobile devices come from tablets versus ultrabooks?","Diana G. Reardon","Yes, I don't think we would give a specific percentage, Wamsi. I think that from a tablet perspective, it's certainly an important part of the market, as still are our phones. And those would be bigger probably than the ultrabooks would be, but that's probably about as much detail as we would like to give.","Operator",".","And our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","When we start thinking about -- you made a couple of changes here with -- you're now increasing your dividend, and I think it's been about 1.5 years since you did that. Your cash level is at all-time high cash level, as you extended your line of credit. Is Amphenol kind of thinking about potentially digesting some larger acquisitions? It seems like the acquisitions to date have been a little bit slower than normal, but yet you're kind of increasing your dividend. So I wondered if there's something to be inferred upon that signal as far as capital deployment or how should we think about capital deployment for Amphenol?","R. Adam Norwitt","Well, Jim, let me just say relative to the question on the acquisition program, we continue to have a very, very strong focus on this acquisition program. We believe that there are opportunities, and we -- whether those are large or small, we don't confine ourselves to those. I think to say that the acquisition program has slowed down, I mean we had 5 acquisitions last year, it's true. Q1 we did not. And we did announce a fine acquisition this quarter, and we continue to have a very robust pipeline. You should not read anything extra into that dividend increase except that we have always talked that we wanted to have our divided roughly at a 1% level, and this brings it right up to that level. And there's nothing more that should be read into that except that our traditional balanced approach to capital management and to return to shareholders is something that we continue to have a lot of conviction to. It has no other read. We continue to believe the company has a strong growth potential. We continue to believe that there are excellent acquisitions to be had, and we continue to approach that in a very balanced fashion.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, and as a quick follow-up regarding the size, Adam and Diana, of potential acquisitions. Amphenol is a much larger company than, say, 5 years ago, and your shareholders are very appreciative of that. Does that mean that the acquisition sizes you need to open up your eyes, a little bit bigger acquisitions or more frequent? Or traditionally it's kind of been 1\/3 organic -- acquisition growth and 2\/3 organic growth? I'm just wondering if any of that changes or how we should think of it.","R. Adam Norwitt","Again, I don't think, Jim, that this is a categorical change, but obviously the mathematics of the fact that we are a $4.5 billion roughly company means that to add 1\/3 of our growth, which is still the number that we believe is an appropriate one for the company, means you either have to buy more smaller deals or do bigger deals. And I think I would expect over long-term that there will be some combination of that. Last year with the 5 acquisitions, that was a very substantial addition to Amphenol on an inorganic basis of 5 excellent companies in 5 unique markets, and really not only supported our acquisition program, but supported our technology development and supported our diversification initiatives in the company. We continue to look at our acquisition program in that very same way. We will be very aggressive in the hunt for acquisitions. We will also be, as we always have been, very prudent in prices that we pay and in our kind of testing of are those companies that we want to acquire. And ultimately, the criteria that we have for acquisitions has not changed. We look for companies with excellent technology, with excellent people, in whom we can really put confidence and which are complementary to the company. And that really has nothing to do with size. We will acquire small companies and we will acquire big companies. And we continue to believe that the industry, the interconnect industry, and all the related areas to that create still tremendous opportunities of those companies to arise. We have great relationships with many and many, many companies around the world. And as we drive and incubate that pipeline, it will have good results for us in the future. Obviously, the timing is something that we have never been able to control, and it's something that we will not be able to control. But the fact that our company has positioned itself as really, in this industry, the acquirer of choice, puts us in a very strong and competitive position when there is competition for acquisitions. We may not pay ultimately the highest price, but we are a very compelling home for companies when they're looking to have a significant change like a sale of the company.","Operator",".","And our next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just another question, Adam, if I can, on the wireless commentary. I know that you've talked in the past about the opportunities in ultrabooks. And is it your sense that, that's kind of stalled here with the PC upgrade cycle and that's just being pushed out? And then as a follow-up on the WiFi commentary, is your content in those devices because, I guess, the more commoditization of those components in those products? Is it just less and that's why that shift is hurting you?","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure, thank you very much, Matt, for the question. I mean, we have not seen necessarily a big drop-off in the ultrabooks. I think we continue to see new devices come out and new technologies being embedded in them. So I wouldn't say that there's necessarily a huge change in that. Relative to the WiFi content -- comment, it's actually quite simple. The comparison between a 3G or a multi-networked device and a WiFi-only device is very simply that you have fewer content, in particular with the antennas and the various interconnect that are related to the antennas. And so you go from potentially having upwards of 5 signal paths on a device that has 3G LTE multifrequency to a single signal path with the WiFi. And that is just very simple. It's not necessarily that it is just commoditized. You can have high-technology WiFi antennas, but you're going to have fewer of them. And I think it's pretty straightforward how that evolution has happened.","Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And Diana, just a quick question on the gross margin. You had really strong gross margin in the quarter relative to the last few quarters. Was that a combination of higher volumes and mix? And did you also see benefits from the declining raw materials, like gold and copper?","Diana G. Reardon","Sure. I think we feel very good about the profitability we achieved in Q2, both at the gross margin and at the operating income margin level. And I think that it's always hard to pinpoint, Matt exactly, each point that sort of adds up to the margin improvement we achieved. Certainly higher volume and good operational execution are 2 very important factors. But I would say that, particularly in certain parts of the business where we do have higher metal use, I would say that there probably is some impact coming from the fact that those commodities, in particular, are certainly at a better place than they were in the past. By the same token, we have certain parts of the business where plastics is more important, particularly on the Cable part of the business, where we actually didn't see margin improvements, because there we've got some cost trends that are going in the other direction. But on balance, I think there -- we were able to achieve the strongest conversion margins we've seen in a number of quarters. And I think that there was some impact that we do see there from the better cost environment.","Operator","And our next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBC (sic) [UBS].","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Amitabh from UBS. Adam, I just wanted to follow up on mobile devices. You spoke quite a bit on tablets. Just wondering, can you just update us on the dynamics you're seeing in the smartphone market? Is that a market that has simply become too competitive for you guys? Just any update, because we are hearing of new product introductions later this year and going into next.","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure. Thank you, Amitabh, for the question. Mobile devices, as we have said in the past, we continue to have a strong mobile device business. It has not been for us a contributor of the growth in the recent kind of year or 2, but it doesn't mean we still don't have a strong business in that market. We participate in that market, again, consistent with our overall strategy on mobile devices, in those areas where there is a value placed on the technology. And I will tell you that we continue to see that. And in fact, as you mentioned, there are devices, which -- there are so many devices being released by companies that were not even necessarily thought of in the past as the big marquee players. You are seeing a real range of smartphones being developed, and some of those have, in fact, some new technology requirements in them, whether they are thinner, whether they are LTE, whatever, where there can be opportunities for us to participate and to realize the value that we have. So I think that on that basis, we will continue to devote resources to that market. It's significant for us. And we will continue to participate to the extent that there is real engineering technology value in t product. And personally, I think there will be still a great deal, a great range of products where there is that premium put on technology.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then maybe just as a follow-up. On the mobile infrastructure market, you talked about the strength in North America. Are there any other geographies that you're starting to see show some incremental life? We're also starting to hear some rumblings about a potential big build in China later this year. We'd love to get your updated thoughts.","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure. No, thank you very much. Obviously, I mentioned in my earlier remarks that we are very pleased in the wireless infrastructure market to see the third consecutive quarter of growth, and actually this quarter, double-digit growth, that was both on a sequential as well as on a year-over-year basis. I think that North America has clearly been a strength, and you see that in some of the earnings that were just released this morning from some of the OEMs in that segment. Relative to where strength is going to come from, I believe that you can see in the later half of the year, and particularly towards the end of the year, towards the fourth quarter, some potential for a buildout or an acceleration of a buildout, in particular in China. And again, I am never going to bet on the timing of a Chinese wireless buildout. The Chinese operators tend to be very shrewd about how they time that. We should all not forget that Q1 2009 was a very opportune time to buy base station equipment, and that was when they chose to build the first phase of the 3G network. So I wouldn't say that you can kind of take it to the bank that they are going to have this big buildout in the later part of the year. But on the contrary or by the same token, we have heard from customers that there is a lot of talk, and there is a lot of talk that some of these operators in China may indeed be preparing for that, that there may be some significance to the build. I think how that build is going to go, who the equipment manufacturers are going to participate or what equipment manufacturers are going to participate, at what allocation, that all remains to be seen. But what is clear is that we have positioned ourselves very well. I think some of the growth that we have seen here in the recent couple of quarters, this is clearly not market-based growth, but rather it has been the result of efforts that we have been making over the last couple of years to both position ourselves on this new generation of base stations on the integrated equipment, but also very importantly, to position ourselves with operators on the full suite of interconnect and antenna products that we can offer. And so to the extent that, that spending cycle accelerates or continues in the later half of the year, we would be hopeful to have a good participation in that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Adam, I was hoping you could help me understand a little bit better your outlook for flattish revenue growth sequentially in the third quarter with the fact that your orders increased by about 5% quarter-on-quarter and the book to bill was 1.04.","Diana G. Reardon","Sure. Maybe I can just give you some information on the orders in Q2, and then Adam can comment on the markets if he'd like to do that. I think that the business -- first thing is that our book to bill and bookings in the prior quarter isn't necessarily indicative of sales in the next quarter, given the nature of how customers and markets place orders these days. The vast majority of orders in the communications-related markets are more forecast-sharing type arrangements and hub-pulls [ph] and this type of thing. But that being said, I think that the order level that we achieved in the second quarter certainly was strong. It was up about 5%, I think, on a sequential basis, up about 12% on a year-over-year basis. And for us to have a 1.04:1 book-to-bill ratio in Q2 certainly is stronger than what we would typically experience from a seasonality perspective. A lot of those orders and that strength related to some of the non-communications-related markets that are performing quite well on a year-over-year basis, markets like the automotive market, the commercial air market. In addition to that, we saw some good demand for certain value-added products in some of the installation markets that tend to have longer lead times. So those order levels really relate more to shipments that customers will be expecting in the fourth quarter, and really do support the step-up that we see from a demand perspective when we look at our expectations for fourth quarter sales. So there's no question that it is a positive that we saw such strong demand in the quarter. We're glad to see those markets performing at a high-level from a bookings expectation. And that gives us good confidence in the step-up in sales that we see in Q4. But Q3, really from a sequential standpoint, will have kind of those normal seasonal soft points in some of the markets, like defense, industrial, automotive, and so on. And so we won't see that sequential uptick until we move into Q4. I don't know, Adam, if you want to add anything to that.","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes. I mean, the only other thing that I would add is that you should also look at that in the context that normally we would have, in the second half and starting in the third quarter, some step-up in the mobile devices market, where there is not a relationship quarter-to-quarter in bookings. It books when it ships and that doesn't necessarily have a book-to-bill relationship. And so where we wouldn't normally expect some step-up related to that and we don't have that, I think this positive book to bill, as Diana mentioned, is really a good reflection of those longer lead time segments that we have, and it's very supportive of what is still a second half step-up in overall demand for the company from sort of low to mid-single digits, based on our current guidance from first half to second half.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. And then Diana, I understand you made some comments on the margin strength in the quarter. When you look out for the rest of the year or longer term, I mean, do you think there's more room for your margins to move higher?","Diana G. Reardon","Yes, I think that the guidance at this point reflects year-over-year conversion margin that's very, very close to our 25% goal. And so I think that we -- during 2013, we expect to see a margin expansion. We achieved margin expansion in 2012, so we still do see that potential to achieve the higher conversion margin in those quarters where we're seeing incremental sales growth. So in Q3, I wouldn't necessarily expect to see margin expansion, but Q4 would.","Operator","And our next question comes from Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Two questions. Just first off, on commodities being down so much. Do you think you've realized kind of the full benefit of deflation or would you see more of a tailwind into the third and fourth quarters? And then second, because I was listening on the call, obviously the mobile devices are down, but it seems as, if I was listening correctly, the infrastructure, your IT Datacom, maybe your auto and your aerospace forecast, those from customers actually picked up for the second half relative to maybe your earlier expectations. If you could just provide some clarification on that aspect, too.","Diana G. Reardon","Sure. I think on the first question, from a margin perspective, I think when there was a question earlier asked about the strong margin performance in Q2. And I think we said that there are many things that certainly go into margin; both cost and price dynamics, volume, and so on. But I think that we have probably seen some impact in our Q2 operating income performance from that better balance between cost and price. I think it's always a little bit hard to predict exactly where all of those dynamics are going to go when you look out. I think we've given good guidance on profitability. I think the year-over-year conversion margin, as I said, is very close to our 25% goal, and we'll achieve margin expansion. And that's what we see as we look at things today. What the ultimate impact will be from commodity trends really depends very much on where demand goes, where pricing dynamics go and so on. So I don't think at this point we will be comfortable talking about further margin expansion than we already have in the guidance that we've given. But I think, as we've said to these questions in this past, you can be certainly sure that the management team will do their utmost to be able to keep and capture any such benefits that would present themselves as we look through the balance of that pricing and cost profile going forward.","R. Adam Norwitt","Yes. And I think, Shawn, relative to your second point about these markets, do we feel incrementally more positive about a few of these markets? And you mentioned first aerospace, and I would say that we do feel a little bit incrementally more positive about aerospace. Normally we would expect the Commercial Air market to be down seasonally. They tend to have shutdowns, that tends to obviously have some European component to it. And at this point, we would see that there would be actually a slight uptick in sales in the third quarter in the commercial aviation market. We're just doing a great job in that market. I mean, in the second quarter, up 23%. We feel that there has still strong double digit year-over-year growth in the third quarter and for the full year. And it is obviously helped by the volumes. And I think this last quarter, if you look at the order backlog and the orders for the major players in that commercial aviation market, they're booking orders at a tremendous rate right now. But in addition to that, we continue to gain presence on new platforms. And as these new planes are being designed and developed, it's no secret to anybody that there a lot of challenges that the airplane manufacturers are facing. They're putting new materials into these planes. They're trying to get new features embedded into these planes. And a lot of the times, they are really pushing the envelope in terms of embedding these new technologies into planes. And we have had, in some instances, customers come to us on the basis of a schedule that normally should have been something was designed-in years ago, and they come to us, say, \"Hey, we have that new challenge. Is that something that you can help us with?\" And so our engineering team is extremely busy still, working with those companies as they seek to embed all these new technologies into the plane. And I think that, combined with the volumes, is something that makes us feel incrementally more positive about the commercial aviation market. You mentioned also wireless infrastructure, and I think I spoke about that earlier. I would say that, yes, we feel a little bit more incrementally positive on that market. I commented already on the fact that we would hope to see some uptick, especially later in the fourth quarter. And then automotive market is another one where we just feel very good about the strength. I think we will see some sort of seasonal flat to slightly down performance. In other years, you could have in the automotive market a seasonal decline in kind of the mid-single digits in the third quarter. And we would be hopeful that maybe it would be a little bit less than that here, because of our increasing position and because the volumes in that market are doing very well. So I think those markets in particular, we would feel a little bit incrementally more positive about.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mike Wood with Macquarie.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Can you talk about your visibility on the upcoming product introductions in mobile devices and smart computing, and how this impacts that mix that you were talking about between lower end and the value-added products that Amphenol provides?","R. Adam Norwitt","Sure, Mike. Thanks very much for the question. Obviously, I'm not going to talk about specific programs. We have very strong NDAs in place with all of our customers on that. But what we have seen is there were certain new products -- and this was not confined to one customer, I mean, there were several customers -- where there were new product launches end of last year, early this year, which didn't really realize the volume potential that the customers had originally expected and that they had expected really throughout the year. Relative to the new programs, we certainly are participating in a lot of new programs. I think if you look in particular at the tablet market, there is a lot of growth in overall units in the tablet market. But where that growth is tends to be in the smaller tablets and tends to be at the lower end of the market, where you're talking about ASPs of $180 to $100 instead of $500, $600. And as the overall products that are being released and driving growth have lower value to them, there is sometimes an inherent value -- a value opportunity to us that is less. And so at the same time, we also are participating in high-technology releases that are happening during the course of the third and the fourth quarter. But net-net in that market, that change that we've talked about earlier in the call, combined with the new programs that we are not necessarily having the volumes that we originally expected of them, that results in the guidance that we have given here.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Okay. And also on the factory automation strength you'd called out, can you talk about any specific regions or pockets of strength there? A lot of the factory automation industrial companies haven't been reporting growth there.","R. Adam Norwitt","Factory automation is an important part of our diversified industrial business. I think where we've seen the strength is not necessarily confined to one or another region. There is a lot of automation happening, of course, in China, where you see labor costs going up and companies like us, of course, reacting by putting in place semi and full automation in certain cases. But you see also automation being related to the auto industry. And we have a tremendous array of products that go into very heavy-duty factory automation that's used in auto plant upgrades, new model upgrades. And we have certainly seen some strength there. And then the general European, which is really a German factory automation world, we have also seen some strength in that area as well. So I think it's a very broad -- I wouldn't draw a specific regional conclusion about it. The only thing that I would say specific to Amphenol is that we continue to expand our product offering here. And so I wouldn't necessarily say that we are a clear readthrough to the whole factory automation world. We have a position that is a growing position, where we are really expanding the range of technologies, both interconnect components, as well as value-add assemblies, whereby we can have a stronger position in that market going forward.","Operator","And our last question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research.","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","I'll keep it brief, but just to summarize some of the puts and takes on the wireless market. Can you talk about how much is related just to sort of how the product mix has shifted away from you versus end demand? Which is a greater factor? And is there anything, Adam, that you guys are doing in terms of changing your strategy into the marketplace to maybe capture more of the TAM? Or is it sort of you just have to find your right niches going forward?","R. Adam Norwitt","Well thank you very much, Steve. Look, I think it's very clear that what has driven this change in our guidance, as I've explained during the call, is a real change in the nature of some of the products that we're working on, whereby there is this kind of -- I would almost call it a onetime shift in the content opportunity on certain of those devices. We think that, that is not necessarily a shift that's going to continue and continue and continue. It seems to be something that is a kind of a more than expected, more dramatic than expected onetime shift there. Relative to end demand, as I mentioned, the tablet market overall is growing. The opportunity in certain of these products, that has created that change in the demand. Our strategy does not change. We are not going to chase after low-margin products. We're not going to chase after products where there's not the opportunity for us to inject technology. We believe that there is still an outstanding opportunity going forward for us to find places in the market, broad places in the market, not just niches, but broad places in the market where our technology can serve ultimately the purpose of helping our customers sell more of their products. And when you can do that, ultimately you can make the value that we want to make as a company and the margins, and ultimately you can have growth in the business. And we still have a strong conviction that, that opportunity is still ahead of us.","Well if there's no further questions at this time, once again, we appreciate all of your interest in the company and your attention, and I hope that you all have an excellent summer. Thank you very much.","Diana G. Reardon","Thank you.","Operator","And thank you for attending today's conference, and have a nice day."],"2247":["Amphenol Corp.

Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is also being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.","Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2018 conference call. Our third quarter results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends, and of course we will take questions.","As a reminder, we may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information.","The company closed the third quarter with record sales of $2.129 billion and with record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.01 and $0.99 respectively, exceeding the high end of the company's guidance for sales by approximately $110 million and adjusted diluted EPS by $0.06.","Sales were up 16% in U.S. dollars and up 17% in local currency as compared to the third quarter of 2017. From an organic standpoint excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the third quarter increased 15%. Sequentially, sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency and organically.","Breaking down sales into our two segments, our Cable business which comprised 5% of our sales was flat in U.S. dollars and up 4% in local currency as compared to the third quarter of last year. And our Interconnect business which comprised 95% of our sales was up 17% in U.S. dollars from last year, driven primarily by organic growth. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.","Operating income was $444 million for the third quarter. And operating margin was a record 20.9% in the third quarter of 2018, up 40 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2017 of 20.5%, and up 30 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2018 of 20.6%.","From a segment standpoint in the Cable segment, margins were 13.1%, which is flat compared to the third quarter of 2017. And in Interconnect segment, margins were a strong 22.7% in the third quarter of 2018, which is compared to the third quarter of last year at 22.4%.","This excellent performance is direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a dynamic market environment.","Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies to both existing and acquired companies, our management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance in the future.","Interest expense for the quarter was $25 million, which is comparable to last year. The company's adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 25.5% for the third quarter of 2018 compared to 26.5% in the third quarter of 2017. The adjusted effective tax rate in both periods excludes the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises as we have previously discussed.","The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 including the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises was approximately 23.8% compared to 21.8% in the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income was a strong 15% of sales in the third quarter of 2018.","On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS grew 15% in the third quarter of this year to $1.01 from $0.88 in the third quarter of last year. Adjusted diluted EPS which excludes the excess tax benefit from stock option exercises in both periods grew 19% to a record $0.99 in the third quarter of this year from $0.83 in the third quarter of 2017 which also excluded certain acquisition-related expenses.","Orders for the quarter were a record $2.12 billion, a 14% increase over the third quarter of last year resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1:1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $339 million in the quarter or approximately 110% of adjusted net income.","From a working capital standpoint; inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were approximately $1.2 billion, $1.7 billion and $1 billion respectively at the end of September. And inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 78 days, 73 days and 63 days respectively which were all within our normal range.","The cash flow from operations of $339 million along with stock option proceeds of $72 million, short-term borrowings of $19 million, and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand of approximately $29 million net of translation were used primarily to repay a net amount of $194 million under our commercial paper programs, to fund net capital expenditures of $72 million, to fund dividend payments of $69 million, to purchase approximately $35 million of the company's stock, and to fund acquisitions of and dividends paid to non-controlling interests of $11 million.","During the quarter, the company repurchased 400,000 shares of stock at an average price of approximately $87 under the $2 billion three-year open-market stock repurchase plan. At September 30, cash and short-term investments were approximately $1 billion, the majority of which is held outside of the U.S.","And at September 30, the company had issued approximately $338 million under its U.S. commercial paper program and approximately $513 million under its euro commercial paper program for a total outstanding balance under its commercial paper programs of $851 million. The company's cash and availability under our credit facilities totaled approximately $2.2 billion.","Total debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $3.3 billion and net debt is approximately $2.2 billion. In addition, as previously announced, the company had a successful European senior note issuance, in which the company issued a 10-year \u20ac500 million note on October 8, which has an all-in effective tax rate of just under 2.1%. The company will use the proceeds to repay outstanding debt resulting in an aggregate pro forma balance of approximately $270 million outstanding under its commercial paper programs. The third quarter 2018 EBITDA was approximately $530 million. And from a financial perspective this was an excellent quarter.","I will now turn it over to Adam, who will provide an overview of the business and comment on current trends.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Well, thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to offer my welcome to all of you here on the phone today, and we very much appreciate you spending some of your precious time with us.","As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the quarter. I'll then spend some time to discuss our trends and progress across our served markets. And then, finally, I'll spend some time to comment on the outlook for the fourth quarter, which is, of course, also the full year of 2018.","With respect to the third quarter, I could just say that I'm very pleased that the company, once again, reached new records of performance in the third quarter with sales and earnings both exceeding the high end of our guidance.","Revenues in the quarter increased by a very strong 16% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically to a new record $2.129 billion. And for the fourth quarter in a row, we booked a record level of orders, in this case, $2.120 billion, which represented still a very robust book-to-bill of 1:1.","Operating margins in the quarter reached a new high, 20.9%. And that's just a clear demonstration of the strength of the company's operating performance, as Craig so eloquently detailed.","And then, finally, we delivered record adjusted EPS of $0.99, growing a very strong 19% from prior year. I can only say that I'm just extremely proud of the Amphenol team around the world. I mean, their ability to respond to the many opportunities in the exciting global electronics market, all while driving excellent operating performance, is clearly reflected in the company's strong third quarter results.","Now, turning to our progress across our served markets, I would just comment that our end market diversity, once again, was a great asset for the company here in the third quarter. With no market representing more than 20% of our sales, we remain very pleased by the breadth and balance of our end market position.","I would just point out that this balance creates great benefits for Amphenol in any economic cycle. And very importantly, we're also pleased that we realized strong organic growth across nearly all of our end markets here in the third quarter.","So turning, first, to the military market, the military market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. And simply put, we had just another great quarter in the military market. Sales increased from prior year by a better-than-expected 22% in U.S. dollars and 23% organically.","Our growth in military was really broad-based and included aircraft, military vehicle, helicopters, space, and communications segments, in particular. And sequentially, our sales rose by 2% in what is typically a seasonally softer summer quarter.","Looking ahead, we expect sales in the fourth quarter to remain essentially at these robust levels. And for the full year 2018, we now expect to achieve sales growth in the high teens for the military market, a stronger outlook than we had coming into the quarter.","2018 has no doubt been an excellent year so far for our team working in the military market. They continue to successfully expand our position by driving our broad array of high technology products across the widest range of military applications.","In addition, I'm very pleased with our team's ability to react to this increased level of demand from our customers, not always an easy task. And amidst this stronger overall defense spending environment, we look forward to continuing to leverage our high technology position to drive further out-performance into the future.","The commercial aerospace market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by 9% in U.S. dollars and 10% organically as we benefited from continued growth in jetliner volumes, as well as increased content on new airplane platforms. Sequentially, sales were slightly down from the second quarter on expected seasonality.","Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these levels. And for the full year 2018, we continue to expect a low double-digit increase from prior year. We remain encouraged by our strong performance in the commercial aviation market so far this year and look forward to continued progress going into the future. Our team working in the comm air market has successfully expanded the company's technology position across a wide array of next-generation commercial aircraft, thereby creating a great long-term opportunity for the company.","The industrial market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew by 12% in U.S. dollars and 10% organically. And this growth was really driven by expansion in rail mass transit, medical, heavy equipment, battery and entertainment; again, quite broad-based.","As we'd expected coming into the quarter, sales were down seasonally from the second quarter moderating by about 5% sequentially. And looking into the fourth quarter, while we expect sales to further moderate from these levels, we continue to expect mid-teens sales growth for the full year in the industrial market, a very strong performance.","We remain confident in the long-term strength of our position in the industrial market. Through our organic product development efforts, together with our ongoing acquisition program, we've built a very robust and diversified suite of interconnect and sensor products for the widest array of industrial applications. As electronics continues to transform these industrial applications, we look forward to realizing the benefits of our excellent position in this important market into the future.","Turning to the automotive market, the automotive market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the automotive market were just a touch softer than expected, but still grew by a very strong 10% in U.S. dollars and 8% organically. Sequentially, sales moderated slightly from the second quarter. They were down by about 4% in U.S. dollars and just about 2% organically on a sequential basis.","Looking into the fourth quarter, while we do expect sales to increase modestly from these levels, for the full year 2018, we now expect sales growth in the mid-teens, which while strong is slightly lower than our prior expectations. This reflects some small degree of moderation in demand from certain vehicle manufacturers, as well as their Tier 1 customers.","Nevertheless, we remain encouraged by the company's strong position in the global automotive market. Our team around the world continues to expand the company's range of high-technology, interconnect products, sensors and antennas for a wide array of applications within vehicles. These developments, together with our ongoing strategy of acquiring companies that offer complementary technologies, has positioned us strongly for the future as carmakers are integrating advanced electronics into fuel-powered, hybrid and electric vehicles.","In addition, we continue to work aggressively with customers around the world on new advanced technologies. And these include next-generation emissions and drivetrain systems, autonomous and semiautonomous driving, as well as next-generation high-speed data interconnect, just to name a few. All of this creates a great long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol.","The mobile devices market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter, and our sales performance in mobile devices was much stronger than expected here in the quarter, as we were able to execute on increased customer demand for both new and existing programs.","Sales rose by very strong 30% from prior year driven by higher sales of products incorporated into smartphones, together with strengthened performance related to laptops and wearables. Sales increased significantly from the second quarter rising by an impressive 72% sequentially.","I just cannot emphasize enough how our team working in this extraordinarily dynamic mobile devices market was able to quickly ramp up in the face of higher than expected requirements from our customers. And thereby once again, demonstrating their outstanding agility and reactivity.","Looking into the fourth quarter, we now expect a modest increase in sales from these currently high levels. And in light of our significant outperformance in the third quarter as well as our more favorable view of the fourth quarter, and of course understanding as always the inherent volatility in the mobile devices market. We now expect sales for the full year 2018 to increase by somewhere approximating 30%. This compares to our prior guidance of mid to high teens sales growth, as we came out of the second quarter.","Our team working in the mobile devices market continues to just do a fantastic job expanding our position in this exciting space. And while the mobile devices market is certainly not predictable, the agility of our team working in mobile devices continues to enable us to drive great success. Their reactivity in meeting the challenging and ever-changing demands from customers, all while continuing to develop innovative, next-generation products and manufacturing processes has secured our leading position in this important market.","We look forward to continuing to realize the benefits of this position for many years to come. The mobile networks market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter and we drove better performance than expected in the third quarter with sales growing by 12% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically.","Our growth this quarter was in particular led by stronger sales to mobile network equipment vendors. Sequentially, our sales were slightly lower than the second quarter due to the impact of normal seasonality which we had anticipated. While, we expect some modest reduction in sales from these levels into the fourth quarter, we now expect low double-digit sales growth for the full year 2018 which is a more favorable outlook than we had 90 days ago.","We're encouraged by our performance in the third quarter, as well as by our improved full year outlook for the mobile networks market. And while we do not believe the strength is yet driven by significant investments in 5G networks, our position in the mobile networks market in those next-generation systems continues to strengthen.","Our team remains focused on working to broaden our range of high-technology products sold into both equipment manufacturers and service providers as they prepare for the next generation of mobile network construction.","As we look to the future, we look forward to realizing the benefits of these important efforts. Information technology and data communications market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter and our team working in IT datacom really drove excellent and stronger than expected performance in this market with sales growing by 18% in U.S. dollars and 16% organically from prior year, as well as 6% sequentially from the prior quarter.","Our growth in the third quarter was broad-based across servers, storage and networking product and was supported by our sales to both equipment manufacturers as well as to the new generation of web service providers.","As we look towards the fourth quarter, we expect sales to moderate from these high levels. But nevertheless, we now expect sales for the full year to grow in the low double digits from 2017 which is a more positive outlook than we had anticipated coming out of last quarter. Our position in the IT datacom market is as strong as ever, as we continue to extend our leadership in developing a wide array of next-generation products in high-speed, power and fiber-optics for a broad range of equipment manufacturers and web service providers around the world.","As customers continue to accelerate data center performance, in order to manage what is clearly an explosive growth of online traffic, we remain confident that our high technology offering positions us strongly for the future. And finally, the broadband communications market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales reduced slightly from prior year by about 3% as cable operators continued to moderate their spending. On a sequential basis, sales were flat to the prior quarter which was a bit softer than we had expected coming into the third quarter.","For the fourth quarter, we expect a slight decrease in sales from these levels. And for the full year 2018, we continue to expect that our sales will be approximately at the same level as last year. Despite our relatively muted outlook for the year, we're still confident in the strength of our position in the broadband market and we look forward to realizing the benefits of our expanded product offering in support of customers who are delivering data, video and voice to consumers and businesses around the world.","So just in summary and with respect to the third quarter, just simply put I'm extremely pleased with the company's strong results as the entire Amphenol organization continued to execute extraordinarily well in expanding our market position while strengthening the company's financial performance.","And Amphenol's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages; our leading technology; our increasing position with customers across a very broad and diverse range of markets; our worldwide presence; a lean and flexible cost structure; a highly effective acquisition program; and then really most importantly, it's all on the basis of an agile and entrepreneurial management team.","Now turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full year, the overall demand environment no doubt remains strong. But nevertheless there are uncertainties in the global marketplace and in particular related to geopolitics and trade. So assuming no significant changes to the current economic and geopolitical environment and based on constant exchange rates, we now expect for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 the following results.","For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be in the range of $2.063 billion to $2.103 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.96 to $0.98. This represents a sales and adjusted diluted EPS increase versus prior year of 6% to 8% and 12% to 14% respectively. For the full year 2018, we now expect sales in the range of $8.040 billion to $8.080 billion together with adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.68 to $3.70.","For the full year, this new guidance represents sales and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 15% and 18% to 19% over 2017 levels respectively. But also note that, this outlook now represents full year organic sales growth of approximately 12%, and that's a significant increase from our prior organic growth guidance of 8% to 9%.","So just in closing, I just want to say that, we're encouraged by the company's strong third quarter results as well as our strengthened outlook. And I'm confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon these great third quarter results by continuing to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position, while delivering superior financial performance in 2018 and beyond.","And with that, operator, it'd be our pleasure to take any questions that there maybe.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The question-and-answers period will now begin. Our first question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Ziv Israel - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. This is Ziv Israel filling in for Wamsi. There have been a lot of concerns about China growth lately. What have you seen specifically that is \u2013 are there positive or negative around China demand? Any color there will be helpful. And if you can put it in context of any prior China weakness you've seen that would be very helpful. Thank you.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Well, thank you very much. Look I don't think we have seen any notable changes to the demand in Asia or in China. We have a very broad business on a global basis and we have a very broad and localized business as well in China. We have always prided ourselves on being a true local participant in the market. And that is part and parcel to the way that we're organized.","Whether that is in North America, in Europe, in India, in China, wherever, we rely on local teams of entrepreneurial managers to run our business and that's really part of the real essence of the Amphenol culture. And how that manifests itself in places like China is just in a very positive fashion in that our team really is seen by Chinese customers, by global customers, as being not only a stable team, but one who truly understands the local market and can work on a level playing field with anybody else, including those local participants.","If we look across the various markets, I would say that there haven't been anything notable in China. We haven't seen any notable slowdowns. There are always, in any given year, ups and downs, but we haven't seen anything that is markedly different than in other years.","Ziv Israel - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. That's all I have.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you. Adam, so just in some of the more cyclical markets, be it industrial or automotive, you did point out that things slowed or weakened a little bit. Anything there in terms of just customers reacting to kind of slower growth or inventory, anything on autos and industrial you can point out?","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah. Well, I think autos and industrial, I wouldn't group them, Craig, necessarily into just one category. I think we came into the year with a certain outlook on industrial and we're still standing behind that outlook. We still see that market as a kind of a mid-teens growth market for the year, and I think our team has just done a really wonderful job in that space. I think automotive, I did point out that we've seen just really a slight change to the negative in terms of the outlook from customers. I mean, this has been broadly reported. I don't think we're going to say anything different than what has been broadly talked about, but this is just a general reflection of a little bit of reduction in demand outlook as we head into second half and as we head, in particular, into the fourth quarter.","When we look at our performance in automotive, I would say that, on a regional basis, we've been a bit stronger in North America and Asia, maybe a little bit weaker in Europe. I don't think that that is much different than also a lot of the broad reporting about the overall trends in the market. But what is just really important from our perspective, you can have always volumes going up and volumes going down and demand for volumes going up and down for a wide variety of reasons. And again, I think you all know many of those reasons. But what is critical for us is there is not a change in that adoption and the pace of adoption of electronics into cars and into industrial equipment.","We continue to see just an incredible array of opportunities to really expand our position \u2013 irregardless of the overall trends, to expand our position long term by working with our customers on a very broad basis to enable new technologies; and, in the industrial market that's really with interconnect and sensors. In the automotive market, it's interconnect and sensors and antennas. And I think all of those trends that we in our company and others in the industry have benefited for such a long time; it's not that those trends are changing whatsoever.","Now, I'm not going to be the one to try to give a prognosis about what volumes are going to be beyond here in the fourth quarter. There's lots of people who are much more expert than I am to do that. But what we clearly continue to see is the long-term trend of the adoption of electronics, the enhanced electronic functionality, new applications, new systems. That trend is certainly not changing or slowing down by any token.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Appreciate all the color there. And then, as my follow-up for mobile devices, I know there's a lot of attention placed on one particular customer, but just given the strength that you're seeing as I look at the mobile device market, and particularly China smartphones, that the high-end capabilities you're seeing today in those phones, can you give any context in terms of the significance of that in terms of the high-end of the market kind of broadening out? And is that something that might be helping you?","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah. It's a really good point, and I have talked for many, many years about this market under the context of the fact that we are choosy in this market in such as that we will participate where there is really technology being embedded in the hardware of the mobile devices. And that's been a topic for, I think, the whole decade that I have been CEO of this company, which is our mobile device is eventually just kind of empty hosts for software. And we've always said that we will participate in those mobile devices where our technology, our capabilities really have value for the customer. And that will come when there's really a premium put on the hardware.","And I think what you are seeing on a broad basis around the world is that the phone manufacturers, the service providers, they all know that you cannot just sell these sort of commoditized empty hosts for software and have any differentiating capability. You've got to have features in the phones. You've got to have features in the tablets. You've got to have features in the laptops and the wearables and all those various things that are mobile devices. And those features have very complex requirements. They require an incredible degree of precision. They require an incredible capability, both in design and manufacturing. And so, when we see our team really driving the success that they have here, I think it is exactly in line with our long-term expectations that hardware will continue to have real meaning to the proposition that phone manufacturers and operators make to their customers.","And so, whether that's in China or whether that's in other places around the world, I think you do see lots of attempts at differentiating through the hardware, through the functionality of the devices, and we're there to support that in every place possible. And so, I think that underlying trend of hardware, there's no doubt about it, still a very positive trend for the company.","Look, all that being said, and I said it in my prepared remarks and I will say it always till I'm blue in the face, it's a volatile market. And it's one where you've got to be extraordinarily agile and reactive to the demand requirements of your customer.","And if you can do that consistently, be reactive, be supportive when they need you, and if you can do that with enabling capabilities and technologies, then you have a pretty good long-term position in this space. And I think that's been our recipe, so far, and will continue to be our recipe going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC","Hi, morning and congrats \u2013 or I guess, afternoon, sorry. Congratulations on the results. Two questions. First, just on the mobile networks business, continuing to see some strength there, was there any regional dynamics of stronger trends in the third quarter and now for the year relative to where you were 90 days ago?","And then second, it's my topic de jure as of late, the lack of M&A activity in terms of just spend relative to your free cash flow. It lagged in 2017, you're lagging 2018 here year-to-date. Is there anything that's pressuring the activity other than just pure timing?","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah. Well, thanks very much, Shawn. I mean with respect to mobile networks, as you heard, we had a very strong quarter in mobile networks. I would say that the strength that we saw was more North America and Asia related and Europe was not so strong in wireless. So, it wasn't necessarily regionally balanced. It was balanced across Asia and North America, but not so balanced across Europe.","But that is maybe not necessarily surprising given the overall trends in that space, but we were just really happy with how that came out. We hadn't expected coming into the quarter. I think coming into the year, in fact, when we started out this year, we didn't have such a favorable view of the mobile networks market. And I think our team has just done an outstanding job of capitalizing on opportunities that have presented themselves to us, while also doing the really hard work of making sure that we're well-positioned for the future, and in particular, for the future of whatever that next generation is 5G or otherwise. And so that's \u2013 I think, the team has done just a really outstanding job here on really a global basis.","Now, relative to M&A, I've said it many times. I mean we cannot control the timing of M&A. We continue to work very hard and we have an outstanding pipeline of M&A. But the fact that we didn't close any deals in the quarter should not be at all an indication of any change in appetite or change in strategy, change of approach, or change of opportunity.","I would argue that 2017, we had a pretty good year in M&A. We bought quite a number of really good companies, understanding that as a percent of free cash flow it was maybe a little bit lower than the prior year, but in the prior year, we made the largest acquisition in the history of the company. So, I wouldn't read anything long-term into that and we continue to have a strong pipeline for M&A.","And I will say that we continue to have just a very, very compelling proposition to those companies who really want to join and be a part of something great, to be a part of an organization that is extraordinarily hospitable to them as entrepreneurs, to be a part of a company that has just extraordinarily \u2013 extraordinary breadth and reach from a customer and geographical and technology perspective. It's a very, very compelling proposition for companies when they're deciding to whom do they want to sell and where do they want their company to end up.","We're not going to win every deal that we've said all along. We're going to remain very disciplined on price regardless of environment and we've said that when interest rates were low. We'll say that as interest rates go up. We've said that when stock valuations were high, when stock valuations were low. We've been very consistent about that that we take a long-term approach to acquisitions in a way where we say we're going to get to know them very, very well. We're going to buy companies on the basis of great people, great product and great position. We're going to be very patient through those processes. And when we buy them, they're going to be ours for life. And that's a very, very important principle. And I think, it's been a consistently successful principle in our acquisition program.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. First question is on tariffs and Adam you spoke about tariffs last quarter and some of the steps Amphenol was taking to avoid or mitigate those issues. So I was wondering if you can provide an update on that topic both to what extent Amphenol has seen any direct impact on its own financial from tariffs and whether you think tariffs are having an impact at all on customer order patterns or demand?","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah. Well, no question, Mark, appreciate that. Tariffs continue to be a thing. Unfortunately, it is what it is. I would just say that what I discussed last quarter in terms of our approach and our methodology to dealing with tariffs has not changed.","And let me just remind everybody about that. I mean, first and foremost, tariffs are just a thing that happened. It's not something over which we have control. While we try to lend our voice very passionately to the debate about whether or not there should be tariffs, they are what they are.","And so the question then is, how do you react to those tariffs? And what we have done in our company not surprisingly given our organization and how we choose to operate this company is, we've not taken a one-size-fits-all approach to dealing with the tariffs.","We have really pushed down that decision-making to those \u2013 to the general managers around the world who are implicated, who have to deal with those tariffs. And then those who operate at that level are the best equipped to know the logistics, the manufacturing processes, the supply chain. How those products are made? Where they're shipped to? Who are the customers? And ultimately, who are the competitors? And thereby make wise and real-time decisions about the measures that one can take to mitigate. And there are really countless measures that one can take in this event, whether that is changing the location of manufacturing, changing where value is created, changing how things are flowing into what countries, or of course, adjusting price, which we do with a heavy heart to our customers, but which you must do sometimes.","And I think that the combination of those very operation part-number-by-part-number specific initiatives has ultimately resulted in the third quarter when we had quite a lot of tariffs that we had to deal with in the company really not having any meaningful impact from those tariffs.","And I think, when you see ultimately the operating margins of the company 20.9%, I mean, that is also a reflection of the fact that these tariffs did not have any meaningful damage to our financial position.","Now there's new tariffs every day. There's more tariffs to deal with here in the fourth quarter and I'm sure there will be more next year. And one day hopefully this whole thing will get resolved. But right now, we're managing it because it is what it is. And so, as we move forward, if there are new tariffs, if there are new levels of tariffs, I'm confident that our team is going to work extremely hard in that same methodology, ultimately to make sure that Amphenol as a corporation is not harmed by what I consider relatively misguided policies.","Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful. And a follow-up question on the IT datacom market which has been reporting stronger results than the company had anticipated at the start of the year. Can you help deconstruct that a bit more between the piece for hyperscale and the piece tied to more traditional OEMs? And I'm curious, if hyperscale is now a big enough portion that you could help us better understand what percentage of IT datacom business is tied to hyperscale at this point.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah. Well, I don't have a number for you in terms of what percentage it is. But it has continued to grow at a faster pace than the rest, but I would tell you still it's smaller by some significance to our sales to equipment manufacturers. I think we've seen very broad-based growth in the IT datacom market in particular here in the third quarter. We saw really growth across all the different types of products. So whether that's storage, server, networking. I mean, those were all very strong double-digit growth in the quarter.","And I wouldn't say that there was really a concentration of that into one or another type of customer, one or another region. It was very, very broad-based. And why is that? I mean, we certainly see, as I alluded to in my prepared remarks that, the degree of technology advantage that we have developed over a number of years and that included both acquisitions that we made, our own organic product development.","The breadth of product offering that we have and the depth of that offering, all the products across the price-performance curve allows us and enables us to really be a strong, and really leading partner with our customers regardless of whether they are making a carrier class router on one side, or a blade server, a rack server on the other side and everything in between.","And so, it's the strength of that product technology, together with the breadth of what we're able to offer those customers that has ultimately allowed us to have that more balanced and broad-based strength in the IT datacom market. I think, we feel very good about that position because it comes really at a time when the demands put on IT hardware on a global basis continue to accelerate.","Just you can't pick up a paper lately without seeing some new innovation, some new development that is generating amounts of data that you can't even imagine. I think, I saw a story this week about this sort of deep space telescope which apparently is going to generate in a year as much data as the whole Internet today occupies.","And you think about this sort of exponential growth of data that is being created and things like that, things like autonomous driving, things like video on the Internet, and high-definition video. And I think the matching of our unique and proprietary technologies together with that accelerated data traffic is ultimately the story that results in these results.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes, thank you. Adam, you've done a good job by answering questions here and giving good color. One follow-up, just regarding your comments on the telecom and mobile network area, you talked about strength in really the non-5G areas and there's a lot of talk about ramping in the back half of next year into 2020 in terms of ramps. How are you seeing that play out in terms of how you're positioned specifically with technology and customers?","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah. Well, thanks very much, Matt. Look, I don't \u2013 I can't give you a timing of ramp of 5G, but what I can tell you is that our position is very strong. I mean, our team has been working for a number of years to make sure that our products are designed in on next-generation systems in the broadest sense possible.","And if you think back about what is 5G from an equipment and a performance perspective. 5G is all about speed and latency. And to get really the levels of speed and the reductions in latency that are being really targeted from a 5G and to do that all at frequency sets that are much higher than current networks are operating which thereby requires much more density, I mean that's a lot of technology that gets embedded into these products. And the interconnect products that are used in those systems and are being designed into those systems just in certain cases have real step function performance requirements.","And so I give a lot of credit to our organization, our engineers around the world who've worked with customers to make sure that our products are really front and center as they go through those design considerations. And look while you don't have a \"5G\" in the IT datacom space that we were just talking about with Mark's question, it's a very similar dynamic that you have to have really that leading product and that leading suite of products such that customers can rely upon your products to help their systems perform at these extremely high levels that everybody is hoping to achieve with 5G.","When the timing is going to be and I can tell you we're involved in a lot of build-outs and systems and products where there may be what's called 5G ready, does that mean they are performing in 5G networks, probably not. But we already see customers producing equipment that is forwards compatible for 5G and things like that. So as usual in these generational changes in mobile networks there's a long lead up. There's a lot of test and validation, design work. And then the building out of that system, I think, starts to go slowly and eventually you'll have \u2013 then have some meaning to the overall spending environment. But when that's going to be is a little bit hard for us to predict.","Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Fair enough, okay. Thanks a lot.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Thanks so much, Matt.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. I have two questions as well, guys. I guess, first one, Adam, nice to see the upside you guys have on mobile devices. I think you said it was up 70% plus sequentially in September. When you think about what drove the upside versus what you guys thought it would be 90 days ago, do you think it's more driven by the fact that others that were involved in the same components couldn't execute the way they were supposed to, which I think has happened in the past? Or was it that end demand was just better in the products you're involved in?","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah. I think in this case, the demand was better and our ability to execute on the demand was a bit better than we had anticipated. If you just think about the mechanics and logistics of in a 90-day period having an increase in sales of 70% in a market, which is not so small on an absolute basis. I mean, there's a lot of hard work involved. And I just cannot credit enough our organization, who really made that happen. And when we say make it happen in Amphenol that has a real meaning to the people inside the Amphenol organization. And they really made it happen here. I mean, whether that is getting the production lines in place, getting the right people in place, getting the factories set-up, I mean, all the things that are required.","And this is a team, where this is not their first rodeo, either, as you know, very well, Amit. I mean, this \u2013 we're used to having these significant increases, but it doesn't make them any easier. It just makes you maybe a little bit more confident, in hindsight, that you can do it, again, when it comes around. But again, the simple answer to your question, I think, this was probably less us having to bail people out like we've done in the past and more the volumes being a little bit better and our ability to execute on those volumes being a little bit better on a broad basis.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. That's helpful. And if I could follow-up, you guys obviously are seeing broad-based trends in September; sounds like it's going to continue in December. I heard your comments around tariffs. I'm just wondering, right, tariffs are supposed to go to 25% on January 1 for a lot of products. Is your response and tone (48:45) going to be any different at 10% tariff or 25% tariff? And then, importantly, why do you think customers are not double ordering at this point? If I know cost of connectors goes up by 25%, I might be better off buying more today versus waiting for January 1, and do you think that creates a risk for a bit of a vacuum in the first half of 2019?","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah. Well, there's a lot in that, but let's just be a little specific about what tariffs and when. As you know, there've been three lists of tariffs. There was what was called List 1, List 2, and then List 3. And if you look at the products that are in those \u2013 in List 1, there was a product line called connectors. So \u2013 and that was already at 25%. So List 1 and 2 were at 25%. It was List 3 that has this sort of step one at 10%, and then the second step is 25%. Are customers kind of hoarding or overbuying, in that instance? We haven't seen that, necessarily. Could there be some on the margins? I suppose there could be some, but that's also constrained by just the ability to support those demands. And it's not that you have infinite capacity to support that pull in of demand.","Obviously, we'll do whatever we can with our customers. And also bear in mind that the tariffs are due when the product moves into the U.S., which is not always necessarily when you sell it to the customer. And so, that dynamic that you described is just not as clear. And we haven't seen any real clear indications of that pulling forward.","I think the bigger question around tariffs, and that's one that I'm really not well equipped to answer, is what ultimately is the effect of these tariffs? Where does it resolve? Does that ultimately have any macro economical effects? Does it have other effects? Those are all things that are probably above my pay grade to think about, or at least to make a forecast about. But I think how we deal with the 10%, how we deal with the 25% of that List 3, it's going to be the same way we've dealt with the tariffs that have come so far. And we've had significant products that have been susceptible to those tariffs.","Again, not forgetting about the fact that, by and large, the vast majority of what we make we make and sell in the same region. And that's part of the strategy that we've always taken of being localized to our customers, and so we're not talking about an enormous proportion of our business here; far from that. But there is some that we have to deal with and I think we've dealt with it well so far, and our team will continue to fight like heck to do so regardless of what tariff levels come.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Deepa B. N. Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon, Adam and Craig. Two quick questions from me. One is automotive risk. It looks like the organic growth came in a point or two below your expectations. Just curious how much of that was market versus content coming in softer versus expectations? And what's your comfort with continuing your strong high single-digit content growth performance, if the weakness continues well into next year?","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah. Well, I mean, one to two points organic, I guess, it's kind of hard for me to say is that market or content. But as I said earlier, we don't see any signs of content slowing down. I mean, far from it. We continue to see new electronic systems being adopted into cars. So I guess, without knowing exactly what the drivers of the one or two points of organic change, I would say that it's probably the market. And I think I said earlier that we continued to see \u2013 have a very favorable view, long-term, towards the continued expansion of electronic content in cars around the world. And what the market will be, what the total value \u2013 or total units of cars is going to be, that's much harder for us to predict. But I think we still feel comfortable that content is going to continue to grow.","Deepa B. N. Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. My follow-up is on semiconductor supply chain. Are you seeing any impacts from this well-broadcasted passive shortages, either directly or indirectly? And generally, has that headwind abated? Has that accelerated? I mean, just curious. I mean, it's something that seems to have hit a lot of companies this quarter? Thank you.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah. Well, thank you. No, I think we've talked about that for a couple of quarters and it's a well reported \u2013 as you correctly point out, it's a very well-reported discussion about, in particular, passives and, I guess, some semiconductors. We have not seen any meaningful impact on the demand of our customers due to these shortages that are so widely reported. I think we're still performing very strongly. On an absolute basis, our growth has probably accelerated over the course of the year, and I think that that's a sign that it hasn't been any real meaningful impact.","Have our people spent a little bit more time because there are some of these passives and other assorted components that we once in a while buy for some of our more advanced products? Sure, our sourcing team around the world is working maybe a little bit of overtime to make sure that we don't have any impact on our supply to customers. But the sort of ancillary question of, are customers buying less from us, in general, because they can't get the matching component, while there may be an odd anecdote about that, I can't say that that's had any meaningful impact to the performance.","Deepa B. N. Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. If I can sneak just one more in, sorry. Your performance no way indicates that end markets have lost momentum broadly. But my question is what is the sentiment at your customer base that are buying your products? Has that moderated versus 90 days ago? I mean, obviously that's a big deviation from the weak market sentiment we're seeing. I mean just curious what your thoughts are there? And I'll pass it on. Thank you.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Well, thank you. Look I don't think I would say anything different about the sentiment than is reflected in our guidance here for the fourth quarter, which I think continues to be a very strong guidance. I think our customers continue to be very positive, at least, the ones that I have interfaced with and I visit lots of customers on a very frequent basis.","I think our customers are continuing to look for us to do the same thing that we've done in many cases, which is to deliver to them enabling technologies that helps them to get their systems to operate at higher levels. We've talked about that with IT, with mobile networks, but the same is true in military where we've done a fantastic job to both produce and design advanced technology products, but also to satisfy a level of demand that probably that industry hasn't seen for quite some time.","We talked about that in automotive as well where customers while there's been some slight moderation in the overall demand that demand for new technologies has really not changed, so. And I could go through the markets, all of them, and all reflect on the fact that I think our customers are very positive about the future. Our customers are very thirsty for next-generation technologies. If there are short-term swings in demand that is what it is I think for some of them.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Jim Suva - Citi","Thanks very much. Adam and Craig, any comments on what you see for inventory levels, whether it be distribution, your customers across the supply chain, because we got to think that giving the tariffs as well as uncertainty and very strong or longer than normal lead-times, one has to wonder about excess inventory or double bookings and will that show itself in a positive manner now and catch up to us? Or simply are your lead-times smaller than say maybe semiconductor companies that have a longer lead-time? Thank you.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Thanks very much Jim. I mean, as I've said before, we don't have perfect visibility into the warehouses of our customers. We do see the inventory levels of a good degree of our distribution channel and I think their inventories seem healthy, nothing really notable in our distributors.","Look, with all the things that you very astutely pointed out, things like tariffs and the various lead-times and double bookings and all of that, I think a lot of those things are much more related to these passives and semiconductors that Deepa alluded to.","Remember that our industry is a different industry and the way we run our company is, once again, a little bit different. It's not a capital-intensive industry and certainly the way that we run Amphenol is not in a capital-intensive fashion. Our ability to react and to adjust to changes in demand, be those on the upside which is a bit more fun, but also on the downside, is really a reflection of that agility that we have from manufacturing perspective.","And owing to that agility, we're able to keep our lead-times relatively stable. There are some anecdotes that once in a while where lead-times will go out and I think we've maybe seen a little bit of lead-time stretch in the military market with the extraordinary increase in demand there.","But by and large, the way that we operate and the way that the interconnect industry operates is very different from the semiconductor and the passives industry. And thus, I think you see a healthier supply chain behavior with respect to those things that you mentioned, like double booking and other items (59:11).","Jim Suva - Citi","Thanks so much for the details.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question in queue comes from Joe Giordano of Cowen. Your line is now open.","Tristan Margot - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. This is Tristan in for Joe. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering how lean are your operations at this point in the cycle in terms of capacity and utilization rates. And if you have anything you would like to highlight in terms of CapEx spending going forward?","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah. Well, I would just say that we always operate in a very efficient fashion. I think I just \u2013 when we just talked with Jim about inventory levels, I mentioned that from a capital spending it's not a capital-intensive business. The way that we operate our factories is a fast and flexible fashion. So from that perspective, we're always operating lean. And that's part and parcel to the Amphenol culture. It's not that we try to get ahead of things and build huge capacities and then wait for the orders to come and nor do we when times are good, burst at the seams and can't support our customers. So we try always to scale our operational infrastructure to the demands of the customers regardless of what cycle we're in.","And I think when you look over a long time period at the performance of the company, especially during volatile economic times, you'll see that that reflects exactly that principle ultimately in the numbers.","Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.","And the only thing, I guess, I would add on that is as you see this year we have had a little bit higher end of our range from a capital spending perspective. I mean, we have had pretty high levels of growth organically over the first three quarters and certainly guidance for the year here. And in those years while we do have a more significant growth, we certainly do spend a little bit more on capital. But again, it's typically within that kind of 2% to 4% and this year we'll be a little bit higher up into that range. But again, that's just driving those high level of growth that we have right now.","Tristan Margot - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then Adam based on your comments about China and tariffs, I guess, you're still likely to do M&A there in China, I think, with the current situation?","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Yeah. I think I would answer it even more broadly, which is, we don't do M&A. We don't hunt for potential new family members in Amphenol in a way that is trying to chase the market, a hot market or run away from the market that has maybe lost favor in the electronics industry. We take a very, very long-term view towards acquisitions.","Our criteria for acquisitions remains very consistent. I alluded to it earlier. We look for great people. We look for great products or in other words technology and we look for fantastic market position. And sometimes we'll make acquisitions when it's perceived to be the right time and sometimes we'll make acquisitions when it's not perceived to be the right time. And that's all part and parcel of a strategy that says we're buying these companies for the long-term, which is really for a permanent basis.","We believe in Amphenol that when we make these acquisitions, we're getting married for life to those companies and to those organizations. And so whether you buy that in one quarter when that's the right place to be or in another quarter where it's not as much of the right place to be that for us is less important. So if the right company comes along, fabulous entrepreneurs, great products, great market position and that happens to be in China or that happens to be in a market space that is not necessarily the hottest space of the moment, we're not going to shy away from that. And along with that I will tell you, regardless, we're always going to be reasonable in terms of our valuation and disciplined in terms of the process of the acquisition.","And I think that approach, which is really an approach that is agnostic to short-term variations in market trends and environments is one that has served us very well over the long term.","Now, if there are governmental impediments that are put in place, very significant governmental impediments that are put in place, obviously we're not blind to that. And we would be very sensitive to that because any company that we buy, we want to make sure that there are not structural impediments to success. But I don't think we see that in any geography today of any significance.","Operator","Thank you. And speakers we show no further questions in queue at this time.","R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.","Well, that's very nice. And again, thank you all very much and we truly appreciate your time today and your interest in the company. And I wish you all a very enjoyable fall season and that we will look forward to seeing you just at the beginning of 2019. Thank you all very much.","Craig A.
