No other recordings or copies of this call are authorized or may be relied upon.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Pizzi.","Michael Pizzi","Good evening, and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter and full-year earnings call. The past 12 months were historic for our industry and will no doubt be remembered as one of the most significant periods of sector-wide disruption.","Nonetheless, our business proved its power, and we delivered solid business and financial results, marked by our strongest year ever for retail trades, derivative trades, corporate services client wins and customer cash growth, and we generated net new assets just shy of the firm record.","We tactically shifted capital deployment to optimize value amid a challenging interest rate backdrop, returning the greatest amount of capital to our shareholders ever with $1.2 billion in repurchases and dividends.","Throughout the year, the team raised the bar on our commitment to the customer, delivering significant enhancements across digital properties, including a fully integrated toolset for active traders with the launch of our award winning Power E*TRADE platform, followed by a continuous series of differentiating functionality, including increased customization, charting enhancements, dynamic alerts, comprehensive idea generation tools, and paper trading, to name a few.","We also meaningfully bolstered our mobile offering with the launch of a revamped iOS app while also diving deeper into the voice assisted space with our integration of Google Assistant.","On the institutional side, we launched the E*TRADE Advisor Network, our RIA referral program, and brought it up to marching speed across all our branches and national sales center.","We further strengthened our top-rated corporate services platform with first-of-its-kind technology across tax reporting, ESPP share withholding and trade clearance automation, while also unveiling a groundbreaking alliance with an innovative ESPP start-up Carver Edison to help employees\u2019 nationwide get the most out of company-sponsored stock plans.","To cap off the year, we laid the groundwork for a comprehensive financial wellness offering that transcend stock plans through our acquisition of Gradifi, a leading student loan benefit administrator.","Our team is laser-focused on delivering great experiences to our customers, we are seeing some well-deserved validation, earning the number one online brokerage designation by Kiplinger in August, as well as banners for number one rated mobile options and web-based platform by stockbrokers.com, offering tangible proof of how our value proposition competes and wins against much larger players.","There is much to be proud of as we reflect on the year, but 2019 will also be remembered for the tectonic shifts in the competitive environment. As zero commissions became table stakes and the two largest players in our direct industry announced the intent to merge. Both of these dynamics have uncovered opportunity for E*TRADE.","The former leveled the landscape for digital brokerage customers by removing price from the equation, allowing our superior value proposition to shine bright and the merger presents a unique opportunity to take market share, which we must seize with deliberate measures.","Huge transactions like these lead to significant assets in motion. And we will serve as the alternative for those who fear they could get lost in the shuffle in a mega company where personalized service is not a priority for all customer tiers.","We will lean into this opportunity with the firepower of E*TRADE's iconic brand, our industry-leading platform, and our best-in-class service teams to firmly plant our flag as the choice for the digitally coined and perhaps disaffected trader, investor or advisor.","Shifting to broader market conditions. After relatively flat performance in the spring and summer, the S&P 500 roared back in the fourth quarter with a 9% increase, capping a full-year total return of 30%, which serves as the second strongest year for equities in the last two decades.","While equity markets remain robust, questions around global trade, tensions in the Middle East and uncertainty heading into U.S. election year have caused retail sentiment to begin to wane, as evidenced by record customer net buying activity in 2017 and 2018, reversing to net selling in the last six months of 2019.","Despite a more reserved retail investor, we continued to grow at a healthy pace. As the breadth of our offerings range from robo advisory to derivative trading and manage products to fully advised solutions, allows our customers to navigate markets both good and bad. Furthermore, the diversity of our corporate service channel provides a healthy flow of accounts, assets and deposits across the market conditions.","Moving to operating results for the quarter. We generated $6 billion of net new assets in Q4, our strongest organic quarter ever. For the full-year, we generated $15 billion of net inflows, just shy of the record year from 2018.","We generated DARTs of 331,000 and derivative DARTs of 111,000, both records. The increased engagement is very encouraging, particularly within derivatives. And while we no longer generate commissions on stock and ETF trades, strong customer engagement portends well for our other sources of revenue.","Customer trading momentum continues to build in 2020 with both year-to-date DARTs and derivative DARTs up over 35% from last quarters' level, which is partially benefiting from smaller trade sizes on average.","Corporate services had another stellar period as total assets ended at $296 billion. We generated record corporate services proceeds of $35 billion in 2019 almost double what it was three years ago, which helped contribute to the overall strong net asset flows into retail.","We expect the net new asset and deposit growth contribution from corporate services to continue to accelerate given the significant number of clients and assets we've won over the past several periods.","For the year, we implemented $24 billion in stock plan assets, a record year following $23 billion in implementations in 2018. And last, but certainly not least, we generated $6 billion of customer cash growth in Q4, a company record. Chad will speak to the cash dynamics in more detail, but the growth illustrates the power of our multi-channel platform to generate deposits.","Looking forward, I'd like to highlight our key priorities for the New Year. First, we will seize the opportunity to gain share amid the meaningful shifts in the industry, namely commission reductions and the merger of our peers. Second, we will advance our RIA offering. Third, we will broaden our corporate services offering to encompass financial wellness. Fourth, we will continue to enhance our industry-leading digital solutions as we execute on our retail growth plan. And fifth, as always, we will balance growth opportunities with expense discipline.","To expand on each of these points in a bit more detail, we see a huge opportunity from anticipated industry consolidation. Even with the best executed combinations, all customers will not be satisfied with their experience being chosen for them and we aim to win every dissatisfied relationship that comes out of the Ameritrade Schwab transaction.","The team is highly focused on this near-term opportunity and we are deploying incremental resources across sales and marketing. This extends across retail where the opportunity is significant right into the institutional channel where the potential is arguably even greater.","In Advisor Services, we are diligently working to integrate our RIA offering to connect third-party advisors to our back and middle office by summer. This channel remains critical to retaining relationships through our referral network. But even more timely, it allows us to present a custody alternative for advisors who are unhappy with the proposed merger of our peers. We see clear opportunity here as evidenced by the number of RIAs that have reached out to us.","In Corporate Services, we are capitalizing on our industry leadership position and broadening our offering to encompass holistic financial wellness, of which Gradifi will serve as our springboard.","E*TRADE serves many of the leading firms in the U.S., including roughly half of public technology and healthcare companies, many of which are hiring graduates from advanced educational programs with heavy debt burdens. This is one of the most pressing generational problems of our time and is driving the increased necessity for employers to provide a benefit that helps their best and brightest employees position themselves for financial independence.","This has been a true hot topic with both current and prospective corporate clients and legislative proposals recommending favorable tax treatment of tuition payment and student loan paydown is only advancing the discussion. We are fortunate to add this leading provider to our platform further enriching the value that we can deliver.","Shifting to our digital offering. We have much in store as we evolve E*TRADE into a more fully integrated provider of financial services. Over the past year, we have focused on improving ease of use, particularly around mobile and have created a more customizable and personalized interface.","As we enter 2020, our retail goal center on deepening customer relationships, igniting customer acquisition, developing a more analytical approach to our customer interactions and offers and expanding brand residents beyond trading. Some of these specific initiatives, including proving the integration of our brokerage and banking, streamlining our transaction capabilities and enhancing our value proposition for digital advice.","And finally, we seek to balance growth with expense discipline. We have a highly efficient business model that is geared to operating leverage. We will arraign diligent in keeping our overhead low and reaping the benefits of our digital first platform.","However, we will not constrain ourselves when it comes to investing for growth and we recognize the opportunity created in the marketplace by the proposed Ameritrade Schwab merger. As such, we are revising our 2020 expense guidance to at or below $1.6 billion from approximately $1.5 billion.","Our original thinking post-commission cut was to reduce advertising and marketing development expense substantially into 2020. We now see clear opportunity for growth and anticipate marketing spend closer to last year's level.","Additionally, we've accelerated the growth in our financial consultant for us from approximately 410 today to a goal of more than 450 by year-end 2020 and in excess of 500 by 2021. This buildout is key to taking full advantage of the growth opportunity that is now squarely in front of us.","We've also accelerated the onboarding of sales and service personnel and our Advisor Services team to take advantage of what has become an even more present opportunity. Furthermore, we have realigned our technology prioritization to deliver more quickly for Advisor Services while making sustained progress on our retail growth plan.","Lastly, while purely environmental, we are forecasting better volumes in 2020 and therefore, we'll have higher variable costs and associated expense categories. As always, we will continue to be dynamic in our spending and shift as necessary to respond to the operating and revenue environments.","In closing, 2019 was a year of twists and turns to say the least, but the results demonstrate that we navigated them deftly. As we look to 2020, we could not be more excited for what the future holds.","We have the right team on the ground to further develop our industry-leading platforms and we have a proven history of finding and integrating inorganic opportunities to evolve our Company. We will leverage our strengths on both these trends as we enter the new decade.","We can not accomplish our mission and vision and uphold our values without the hard work and dedication of our more than 4,000 associates. Core to our culture at E*TRADE is an emphasis on diversity and inclusion and I am exceptionally proud of the progress we have made on that front.","We were recently named a Diversity Champion finalist in the InvestmentNews Excellence in Diversity & Inclusion Awards and just this past week, we earned a perfect score on the HRCs Corporate Equality Index, where we were highlighted for our inclusive healthcare benefits and deep involvement in the LGBTQ community.","I firmly believe that an emphasis on inclusion serves as a differentiator in recruiting and retaining the best and brightest talent in the industry, and when it comes to our status as an employer, I am pleased to also note that we were named one of the best places to work in 2020 by Glassdoor and the only online broker recognized within the top 80 companies.","Before passing the call to Chad, I would like to take a moment to express my gratitude to our former Chief Risk Officer, Paul Brandow for his more than decade of service with the Company. Paul built a best-in-class enterprise function at E*TRADE, enterprise risk function at E*TRADE and he is finally embarking on a much deserved retirement. Paul has served as both a mentor and a business partner \u2013 over various points in my career and we are fortunate as an organization to have benefited from his expertise.","After meeting with a number of qualified candidates, we ultimately decided to leverage our deep bench of talent and tapped our Corporate Controller and Principal Accounting Officer, Brent Simonich to be our CRO. Brent has built a more than 20-year career at E*TRADE through diligence, integrity, and hard work. And I look forward to having him take the same approach to the risk function.","I will now turn the call over to Chad to walk through the financial results.","Chad Turner","Thanks, Mike. For the quarter, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $172 million or $0.76 per diluted share. Included in the quarter was a $19 million pretax or $0.06 per share benefit to provision for loan losses.","Offsetting this is a $0.14 negative impact made up of $21 million in restructuring and acquisition-related expenses tied to the closure of the New York office, severance from organizational changes driven by cost containment initiatives and expenses related to the purchase of Gradifi as well as $8 million in impairment of certain technology assets and a $11 million of higher tax expense related to the reevaluation of deferred taxes.","Before walking through earnings in detail, I'll spend a moment on customer deposit trends given the several moving pieces to modeling the impacts of cash on earnings. Q4 represented a record quarter for customer cash growth, topping off our strongest year ever for deposit growth. There were several driving forces and many should continue to contribute to strong or accelerated deposit growth over time.","First, we experienced strong traction in our premium savings banking product, which grew to $8 billion during the year and further enables us to retain high value relationships. We have additional projects in our pipeline focused on enhancements to our retail banking experience, which should enable further growth of our banking offering.","Second, our leadership and corporate services and record implementations over the past few years contributed meaningfully to deposit growth, as our customers\u2019 generated record proceeds in 2019. By their very nature, corporate services relationships serve as an evergreen pipeline of deposit growth as all participant activity ultimately manifest itself as deposit flows into the retail channel.","Over the past three years, retail deposits source from corporate services have grown at a 9% annualized pace or more than double the growth rate of our other deposits. That pace of customer cash formation should only accelerate considering the nearly doubling of stock plan awards over the past three years currently funneling through the corporate services machine.","And lastly, with respect to customer net purchase activity, with history as a guide, we assume customers will be net buyers over time, although not at the pace we experienced in 2017 and 2018. A simple moderation of net buying behavior should support strong future cash growth. Customer cash growth has continued at a strong pace in 2020 with balances already up approximately $1 billion.","Shifting to core results. Net interest income decreased by $40 million sequentially as our average interest-earning assets remained relatively flat and NIM contracted by 27 basis points. Balance sheet asset levels held steady as we directed deposit growth off balance sheet, creating flexibility that allowed us to return a greater amount of capital to shareholders.","The decline in NIM was driven by three Fed fund cuts in the back half of the year and normalization of securities lending revenue and growth in our relatively higher rate premium savings product. Our blended deposit rate decreased 6 basis points to 28 basis points as we modestly lowered sweep rates on the heels of the October Fed cut and realize the full benefit of Q3 pricing changes. This was partially offset by the growth in PSA. We expect the blended deposit rate, which includes on and off balance sheet brokerage and bank deposits and customer payables to be around 31 basis points in Q1.","Moving to 2020 balance sheet dynamics. With the current reinvestment rate at 250 basis points to 275 basis points and off balance sheet rates around 180 basis points, we are right on the line between deploying capital for on balance sheet customer deposit growth or directing deposits off balance sheet to free capital for incremental share buybacks. Each alternative provides attractive EPS outcomes.","Accordingly, we are remaining tactically flexible in our decision making, growing assets when attractive yields are available while remaining committed to our buyback program. Given these dynamics, we are guiding NIM for 2020 of around 300 basis points with the following assumptions.","First, we assume Fed funds rates remain stable throughout the year. Second, we assume margin balances remain flat to current levels, which are currently in line to where they finish the year. Third, our guidance assumes a flat balance sheet throughout the year with customer deposit growth directed off balance sheet. This maintains some level of new asset purchases as we backfill turnover in our investment securities and the runoff of our loan book.","Finally, we expect to continue to shift premium savings deposits off balance sheet as we began doing in the fourth quarter and bringing lower cost brokerage sweep deposits back in their place. This rotation of moving PSA off while bringing brokerage sweep on will cause some geographic shifts to the model and you should expect to see compression in the blended net fee we earn on off balance sheet deposits from third parties with a corresponding improvement to net interest income given the movement of relatively lower cost deposits on to our balance sheet.","We assume that we shipped a substantial portion of premium savings off balance sheet by the end of Q1, but our actual distribution of deposits will depend on market conditions.","Returning to the P&L. Commission revenue of $56 million was down $66 million sequentially, driven by the commission cuts in line with the expected impact we guided to last quarter. Fees and service charges were up $18 million quarter-over-quarter driven by an increase in off balance sheet fee income and other volume-related revenue.","Third-party cash increased by $6.2 billion as we essentially directed all deposit growth off balance sheet. The average yield on third-party cash was 162 basis points net of deposit costs. This was comprised of third-party brokerage sweep deposit fees of 179 basis points, bank sweep deposit fees of 6 basis points and third-party money market fees of 53 basis points.","For Q1, we anticipate gross fees from off balance sheet brokerage and bank sweep deposits will be around 180 basis points. After accounting for the cost of deposits, we anticipate generating net fees of approximately 165 basis points to 170 basis points on brokerage and 5 basis points to 10 basis points on banking deposits swept to third parties. For the quarter, gains on securities were $14 million well within our guidance range of around $10 million to $15 million.","Shifting to expenses. Total non-interest expenses of $446 million were up $47 million sequentially, driven in part by the previously discussed one-time items. Normalizing for these items, expenses were still elevated as we tactically invested in sales and marketing efforts.","Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 32%, which was higher than our anticipated 27% rate, driven by the revaluation of state deferred taxes. This also drove our full-year rate closer to 28%. We anticipate a 27% tax rate in 2020.","Moving to capital. We executed on $176 million of share repurchases in Q4 and have utilized $586 million of our $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization. We continuously assess market conditions to use capital most efficiently and will aggressively deploy capital to grow the balance sheet if we begin to see signs of a steepening yield curve.","With our assumption of holding the balance sheet flat, we would anticipate executing a minimum of $200 million of repurchases in the first quarter. We finished the quarter with $645 million of corporate cash, reflecting $550 million in subsidiary dividends plus the $176 million used to repurchase our stock and $32 million paid in common dividends.","Finally, after completing our review of the new accounting standard for current expected credit losses, also known as CECL, we anticipate that we will receive a benefit to opening retained earnings of approximately $80 million affected the beginning of Q1.","And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler and the line is open. Hi, Mr. Repetto, your line is open. Go ahead.","Michael Pizzi","There, Rich?","Operator","Okay. So we'll proceed to the next. So next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research and that line is open.","Steven Chubak","Hi, good evening.","Michael Pizzi","Hi, Steven. How are you?","Steven Chubak","Hey, doing well. Thanks. So I want to start off with a question on [NNA growth]. We saw some nice acceleration in fourth quarter, in December, in particular. In addition to the share gains from some of the legacy zero commission players that you \u2013 Mike, I think you had spoken to pretty recently. I'm just wondering, given the incremental investment, are you seeing any opportunity or improved NNA due to the stronger client acquisition following the merger specifically?","Michael Pizzi","Yes, we are. I would categorize the shift in the sort of NNA from coming out of the third quarter into the fourth quarter is driven by multiple factors. One, you hit is the zero commissions have improved the value proposition substantially versus a lot of the financial technology players.","The merger itself has created some degree of inflows, but I'd also like to highlight that we've been more aggressive both on the marketing and sales side, and have been positioning our offering very effectively. And I've seen a broad base lift across both our FCs as well as what is coming in a new customer, as well as additional assets coming in from customers that are already here.","Steven Chubak","Thanks. And just one follow-up on expenses, so based on the 2020 expense guidance, it sounds like the incremental investments are focused on, as you put a number of select or unique growth opportunities presented by the merger, I'm just trying to reconcile, has there been any change in your commitment to deliver on the efficiencies that were maybe contemplated as part of the original $1.5 billion target? And how quickly can you dial that back or manage that spend, if we do in fact enter a tougher environment?","Michael Pizzi","We have a portfolio of expense initiatives that we are \u2013 have assigned teams to and are working on. Many of those predated, some of the recent work to try and take advantage of the market opportunity that's in front of us. That work is ongoing. We anticipate those expense savings will be put forward to increase our growth and to take advantage of the opportunity that's in front of us.","As I highlighted in the prepared remarks, we are after the commission cuts, given what the market environment felt like. We looked \u2013 it looked like we'd be pulling back substantially on advertising and market development. Wouldn't want to ramp sales growth so much.","The merger plus just the change in the environment, seeing the market come back, and customers' engage in a very, very real way with the market has shaped that differently. And that's why we are taking the expense guidance to $1.6 billion.","Steven Chubak","Helpful color, Mike. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Will Nance with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","William Nance","Hey guys. Good evening.","Michael Pizzi","Good evening, Will.","Chad Turner","Hi, Will.","William Nance","Maybe I'll start on the Corporate Services business. So Morgan Stanley was emphasizing some of the success that they've seen in the Solium platform and their appetite to grow the business. Can you talk about the competitive environment, whether you've seen some stiffer competition in corporate services from them or others more recently, and how you're thinking about that into next year?","Michael Pizzi","We are very happy with the progress that we've made in Corporate Services. We continue to improve the functionality of that platform. We think the acquisition of Gradifi really extends us into a new space that we think will be one of the fastest emerging benefits categories there.","You see the importance of corporate service to us. We highlighted the $35 billion of proceeds. It's a record last year. We feel good \u2013 really good about the pipeline in terms of the companies that we're talking with. We believe our product truly makes their life easier. Companies that signed with us can actually reduce their costs around the administration of the plan because the software is so powerful. So at this point, we couldn't be happier with where we are.","William Nance","Understood. And maybe I'll follow-up on the net new asset growth. So this is one of the better months that we've seen in terms of flows into the Advisor Services platform. Can you just talk about the momentum there and sustainability of that flow level and just what we can kind of expect heading into next year as the referral business ramps up? Thanks.","Michael Pizzi","Sure. As you saw in prior periods, there was some weakness coming from some of the larger advisors that came with the TCA acquisition that had some really poor performance and we're losing \u2013 the underlying advisor was losing assets. And so those were coming through to our asset totals.","We've gotten past that. We've added 20 plus new advisors to the platform. And we've sort of made that turn and we're seeing that build. So if you normalize the period for the sale of the ACS business, which is that alternative custody business. We actually had really good flows, up $300 million in the period.","So we're happy with what we're seeing. The referral program is now up and running. It's scaling across the national sales centers, the branches, and we're going to be rolling it out soon to executive services. So we're seeing flows build there. We're seeing solid advisor interest, and we're making great progress on getting the technology to where we think it needs to be.","William Nance","Understood. Thank you for taking all my questions.","Operator","The next question is from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.","Richard Repetto","Yes. Good evening. Can you hear me guys?","Michael Pizzi","Yes, Rich. We can hear you.","Richard Repetto","I apologize with the technical problems here. My first question is on trading. And if you look at the reduction in commission revenue, it's less than the $75 million, plus you've had an uptick in payment for order flow as well quarter-over-quarter. I think it\u2019s about high-double digits. So I guess, the question is, is it reasonable to say that the trading activity is outpacing your expectations?","And I didn't hear a January to-date number and I could have missed that, but just an idea, how resilient this \u2013 do you think this trading activity? And do we have the right or do I have the right view that it is outpacing some of the initial guidance of the $75 million per quarter decline?","Michael Pizzi","Yes. I'll turn it over to Chad for some of the details, Rich. But the January to-date is up about 35%, from where the prior quarter was. So we're off to a great start of the year. We are seeing trade size a little bit smaller, but overall, this is a great environment and we're seeing really good volumes. But I'll turn it over to Chad to give a little bit more color on payment for order flow, trade volumes and items.","Chad Turner","Yes. Rich, so the $75 million that we quoted as a quarterly number, behind the scenes, we think the quarter came in pretty close to as expected around that number. But to your point, the volumes that we saw in Q4 are offsetting that a bit and that's a bit of the dynamic you're seeing there. Also note that we didn't lower commissions until the first weekend of the quarter, so that's getting a little bit of benefit there.","As it relates to volumes and payment for order flow, you can see that trending pretty much in line with our \u2013 with the increased volumes we saw on Q4. To Mike's point, there is a bit of share size, which maybe impacting quality slightly, but still a really positive story. And in Q4 you can see derivatives up a lot, which we do still earn a commission on and payment for order flow. And then that is also up 35% in January to-date. So nice trend we're seeing there on the active trader side as well.","Richard Repetto","Got it. And my follow-up would be, Mike, at an industry competence you sort of \u2013 you stated that E*TRADE hadn't turned away any offers. You also changed the change in control, I guess, payouts to named executive officers. So I guess, I'm just wondering like what's the message you're trying to send to investors? What should we read-through on this?","Michael Pizzi","Well, sure. The change in control payments has been in the investor dialogue for quite some time now. It has intensified in recent months. We decided we would just take the issue off the table. And that's what we did there. In terms of the comments from the conference, I have nothing to add to them here this evening. It was an attempt to set the record straight, which I believe I did.","Richard Repetto","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks. Good evening, everyone.","Michael Pizzi","Good evening, Craig.","Chad Turner","Hi, Craig.","Craig Siegenthaler","I have another one here on the RIA business. With the RIA technology integration completion scheduled for 2Q, what are your expectations for net new assets in the RIA channel for the second half of this year?","Michael Pizzi","Well, let's just start from kind of where we are today. I think we've worked through some of the problems with some of the clients that I talked about in some of the previous question. We're building quite nicely. We're signing advisors. The referral program is scaling. I think this business is on a solid trajectory to continue to accelerate.","Yes, there are some larger national advisors that are waiting for the technology is complete. So that they can connect the way they want to, so that they don't have to go through a separate conversion. I think those will start to build more materially in the second half of the year, specifically into late Q3 and through Q4.","Craig Siegenthaler","And I guess you just hit on that, but you did announce a two very large RIA signed up to the platform like over a year-ago. So is the expectation that those two large IRAs will allocate business to your RIA platform in 3Q, 4Q?","Michael Pizzi","They're already allocating as their part of the referral program, so they're receiving referred assets, and so they're already on the program up and running. But when we get past the conversion, there are additional assets that will come over to our platform as well.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Next question is from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.","Devin Ryan","Great. Good evening, guys.","Michael Pizzi","Good evening, Devin.","Devin Ryan","First one just on the competitive backdrop. So clearly very good flows in the quarter and I'm sure moving forward the competition is going to fight hard to retain their customers. So I'm just curious where you're seeing people compete today, and now that we're for the most part all zero beyond commissions, is it margin lending rates or anywhere else in the model where people are fighting on price to I guess, probably retain customers from you guys?","Michael Pizzi","Devin, I mean margin has been an area that is been very competitive for a long time. I wouldn't describe the dynamics around margin today as being any more competitive than it has been for the more sophisticated larger balance margin customers. It has always been an area where you have to look at the complete profitability picture of the customer and decide sort of the riskiness profile of the margin account as to what you're going to award or give that customer in a negotiation if they're trying to negotiate the margin rate.","Broadly speaking, we're in a position now where most of the revenue received is indirect to the client, meaning the client earns a rate on cash, and then we earn an additional spread on it. The client's order is not a charge to the client. We're just earning a payment for that order from a market center. So as you kind of look what's directly observable in terms to the client is exactly margin rates and option commissions and then maybe a few other fees and service charges, which are not really often charged unless a certain activity occurs. So I think it's a small set of clients that are observing that direct charge. And so I think it's getting more and more difficult to disrupt on the basis of price.","Devin Ryan","Got it. Okay. And then just a follow-up, it seems like you have some evidence on the strong ROI from the ramp in advertising maybe in the fourth quarter, and so that's giving some confidence with the acquisition. But I guess I'm curious on what's changing in the thinking on financial consultants and really feeling like the headcount ramp there is necessary and it's going to have a strong payoff? And if you can, just how you're thinking about the ROI on that as well? ","Michael Pizzi","Yes, sure. As we look at kind of the analysis of financial consultants in terms of just the stats of what a consultant can bring in from an asset and what sort of revenue comes in, and then you look in sort of the assignment universe of clients in terms of how many clients have an active relationship, and then compare that over even into the corporate services world and what we can touch from there.","If we can just linearly hold those production rates constant and add financial consultants, we create the opportunity to grow faster. That opportunity was there before anything occurring this quarter. But I think getting them in place and so growth in that number has always been part of our plan, but getting them in place sooner, getting them in the market today while the opportunity set is there is what we're clearly accelerating and that's driving some of the expense build.","Devin Ryan","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Christopher Harris","Thanks guys.","Michael Pizzi","Hey, Chris.","Christopher Harris","Question on the NIM guide for 2020. I thought I heard you say it is going to be some deposits moving around, some higher cost deposits going off balance sheet, lower cost deposits on balance sheet, and that's part of the NIM. How will that affect your off balance sheet yields for 2020?","Chad Turner","Sure. So as I mentioned, we\u2019re going to earn 180 basis points on a gross basis. And then just for the purposes of modeling, we gave you two different rates off. So on the brokerage side, you would expect that net rate to be in the 165 basis point to 170 basis point range, and then the banking deposit off balance sheet rate to be in the 5 basis point to 10 basis point range. So that's to your point giving you a bit of the math of how that's going to compress the off balance sheet number.","The assumption for the 300 \u2013 approximately 300 basis points of NIM for the year on a flat balance sheet, does assume that premium savings moves off at least a significant portion of it in Q1, which is what is supporting the 300 basis point NIM, while giving a bit more compression off. So depending on how you model growth that gives you a bit of the components of how to think about it.","Christopher Harris","Okay. Thanks for that. And then with respect to advisor, sounds like some good momentum there. However, the platform is new, there's not a really long track record there. Do you think advisors that are not happy with the Schwab and Ameritrade merger are going to be willing to kind of look past that?","Michael Pizzi","Well, I mean, we're focusing on leveraging the platform and the technology strength as a platform, which is a completely open architecture setting that allows sort of the latest in risk management or other items to be connected directly, specifically modeling is a key central advantage. We're going to apply the same principles here that we applied in corporate services. We're going to listen to the advisors and we're going to put in place the technology that truly makes their life easier.","What do advisors want to do? They want to spend their time on client acquisition. They want to get clients in the door. They don't want to spend time on middle and back office burden. We're going to listen to them. We're going to do the things that makes their life truly easier and keeps them out of acquiring clients. So I do think we're going to get good residents around the platform.","Christopher Harris","Got it. Thank you. ","Operator","The next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open.","Brennan Hawken","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.","Michael Pizzi","Good afternoon, Brennan.","Brennan Hawken","Hey. So I think you referenced Mike in your prepared remarks about incorporating financial wellness into your corporate services offering. And you guys just made the acquisition of Gradifi, so that clearly fits in. Does it go beyond Gradifi or is that the expansion? And if it goes beyond, can you let us know like what your plans are, what you need to develop in order to complete that offering?","Michael Pizzi","Sure. The acquisition of Gradifi gives us the most capable platform in the space to manage student loan refinance and student loan paydown benefits, and it's the paydown benefits in particular that we're hearing most from our customers in the corporate services channel. It's a great opportunity for us to add that platform. At a reasonable price tag that gives us something that we can scale very, very quickly in the marketplace.","There are other areas that are very important to financial wellness. Some of them we're in today in terms of products and services on our website from retirement planning and things like that that we can leverage from a planning and tool set. But when you get into kind of other areas such as 401(k), they're probably best approached from an area of partnership and working actively with a larger player in the space in how to go to market together.","Other areas that are out there are going to be things like HSA accounts and items like that. Those are clearly also probably addressed through partnership, but there are also technology innovators in that space as well. So from our standpoint, we're going to build a complete financial wellness offering. We've got a lot of this in house in what we need. Gradifi gives us one missing piece. There's a couple others and we have active plans really on addressing those largely through partnerships, but possible acquisition as well.","Brennan Hawken","Cool. That really helps. Thanks. Thanks for that Mike. And then when you talk about ramping up sales people and FCs, I believe you laid out a plan to ramp not only in 2020, but also in 2021. So when we think about modeling out the expenses out to 2021, should we continue to see some further growth? Would the idea of expense growth be that when we go from your original plan of 1.5, then it moves up to 1.6, should that pace of growth then sustain into 2021? And I think it was touched on earlier, but I'm not sure I got the answer. How are you thinking about an ROI? Or how do you think about the revenue results from these investments and calibrating return on that investment?","Michael Pizzi","I'll let Chad talk a little bit about expense planning in the long-term model. I think a lot of it is how we look at sort of finding productivity to fund investment growth, and what that results to in an expense growth rate. But I'll let Chad cover the details and then how we think about that ROI decision.","Chad Turner","Hey, Brennan. Mike hit on that well. If you look over time, first off just on the long-term earnings. We believe that that low single-digit operating expense growth does support the upper single-digit revenue growth that we expect over time. Clearly that can ebb and flow a bit in any given period, but that's the way to look at it as you step from 2020, all the way through 2023 and 2024.","Now to Mike's point around being efficient and harvesting additional efficiencies to invest, I would use this last quarter as a prime example of that. If you look at our metrics, you will see that our headcount is down quarter-over-quarter.","If you look in more detail behind the scenes at individual areas in the business, what you would find is areas that are down significantly year-over-year to then allow other areas to be up significantly year-over-year as we invest. That's a model that we've used historically fairly well, back when we used to use the operating margin framework as a guide of how do we make sure we're harvesting efficiencies. We're a digital-only firm and so we do have an ability to do that fairly well.","So for example, on the FC side, being able to continue to use operating leverage through technology and other efficiencies to then be able to drive revenue-generating headcount growth is something built inside of our model. I would use that low-single digits as an example of what that looks like over time.","Brennan Hawken","Awesome. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Next question is from Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","Great. Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned the strong deposit growth from the Corporate Services business, I think you said 9%. So just given the larger base as well as more focus of you guys retain those assets, can you provide any metrics, maybe either the trend in the conversion rate or the retention rate just to gauge that potential over the next few years?","Michael Pizzi","Yes. First I would highlight just that the long-term model and the way we built it does not have any sort of meaningful shift in retention rate. That 15% of retained proceeds, 12 months post sale is the number that we still use. [Stef] and team added a great slide to the investor deck, Page 21. I would point you there to give you a good sense of how Corporate Services contributes over time.","We've talked for a long time about the ability over time, not necessarily in any given period, because there are exogenous factors, but over time to be able to get deposit growth in that upper single-digit range.","The slide does a good job of laying that out, where you can see as I mentioned that Corporate Services from 2016 to 2019 is growing at a CAGR of 9% while the remaining businesses at 4%. That's an example of how as that business has scaled and grown at an outsized pace. It contributes meaningfully to cash growth over time.","Given the implementation wins we saw in 2018 as well as 2019 record levels, you could expect that that acceleration would be contribute to that higher overall cash growth in the out years.","Michael Carrier","Okay. And then just one more on the cash. I think you mentioned like the net on the retail side, in terms of cash versus clients like buying like that trend is balanced out versus the last couple of years. Anything that's driving that? I mean, from one standpoint, maybe it makes sense because there's been more uncertainty on the other hand, just given the strong markets, like typically in that backdrop you would see clients putting more cash to work. So just curious if you're seeing anything within the numbers that makes you think that that trend continues?","Michael Pizzi","Well, I think that in terms of what we have seen in 2017 and 2018 was an area where there was consistent increases in retail engagement, meaning that money coming into the market, clients coming into the market, quickly moving balances and redeploying them.","With some of the ebbs and flows of volatility, the geopolitical risk, the election items, trade, you name it. We're seeing a more balanced approach. Customers are still engaged. But they're stepping a bit for the sidelines quicker and moving into cash and that's resulting in a net selling number that's coming into the year-end here.","Look, I'm sure with a 30% gain, some of the selling that we've seen is \u2013 was somewhat tax related. But overall, I think it's a bit of a shift into a more risk-managed or risk-balanced approach within the client set.","Michael Carrier","All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please go ahead.","Kyle Voigt","Hi. Good evening. Maybe just a follow-up on the really strong trends and trading activity, I guess how much of that do you believe is, is related directly to the eliminating commissions versus the market environment? And do you think there could be still upside to the activity levels even from these January levels, the strong January levels as clients continue to kind of acclimate to this zero commission world?","Michael Pizzi","Well, I think certainly we are seeing clients trade more and I think that falls into a couple of different categories. One is clients breaking up their trades in the smaller sizes. That's not necessarily adding a whole lot of value if any, but also just clients trying to trade intraday more, position more, the active traders taking more advantage of the lower commission rate, that is a more sustained effect in terms of the overall volume level. I think that's probably something that's here to stay, but probably not going to grow too much from these levels as clients have pretty much adjusted to their trading styles to what's going on.","Kyle Voigt","Just other one, maybe on the market disruption kind of the assets in motion potentially with the Schwab and Ameritrade merger. And with respect to the opportunity for your advisor channel specifically, can you just give some more details around the sales message that you're going to be going out to market with over the next year to kind of capture some of that opportunity? And any color you can give also in terms of kind of imbalanced calls that you've been fielding related directly to the deal?","Michael Pizzi","Sure. I mean, I talked a little bit in the prepared remarks. We use the word anyone is sort of disaffected. I mean, certainly we want to be a strong presence in the marketplace for that. But there's also just another effect.","When I've talked a little bit about this in the past, if you think of sort of, three physical locations on the intersection of two street corners of three different companies that do the same thing and one closes, the natural just pickup in sort of mindshare or customer mindset that you're going to get from that over time is going to be continuous. And it's not necessarily who's disaffected. It's just there. We are the branded alternative in the marketplace with one of the most iconic brands in the space.","We will benefit even if no one is disaffected just because the number of properties has been reduced. We want to be front in center. We want to have our sales personnel, our tool sets, our digital experience exactly where we want it to be to capture the entirety of that opportunity.","Kyle Voigt","Thank you. ","Operator","Next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Maybe just to continue on that theme, Mike, what are you thinking about for the \u2013 your ambition in winning over customers from the merger over the next few years? And is it \u2013 typically we've seen attrition rates around 5% for some deals and then Schwab has a 4% target for this. Do you think this merger could deliver attrition rate that's potentially much higher than that? And then just over \u2013 just the timeframe of that, typically we see these happen in bunches? Do you see this happening over a multiple year timeframe?","Michael Pizzi","Yes. Look, I think 4% to 5% to get estimate for something where it's managed very well, the best conversions, the best integrations at 4% range is probably a good number. But certainly you can look at other ones that didn't go so well and those numbers can go quite higher.","So there's opportunity beyond that. But I think that's a reasonable size of the opportunity. But I really want to say don't just think of it as that net finite flow. It's also just the number of large branded players in the marketplace, and we should pick up from that just from the evolution of customer mindset as when they're looking for a provider in the space and it's just an increase in the overall natural growth rate. We want to take advantage of that. So it's both elements there.","Now on the advisor side, I think there's a lot more consternation in the market if you will. You can just see it. If you take a look at any of the RIA publications that are out there, a lot of the smaller and medium size RIAs are concerned and there's concern that there's going to be changes around referral flows and greater degrees of internalization.","We want to be a place in the market that has a very strong platform, leads with technology, makes the advisors life easier, provides excellent service to all tiers of advisors, and that's what we're building. That's our mission for our institutional channel. So we think that's going to resonate quite well over time. We thought that was going to resonate well before this acquisition. This is just going to add to that.","Brian Bedell","Okay. Thanks. Thanks for that. And then maybe just along those lines, economically as you try to attract those customers, is that more coming from cash offers that will increase the ad marketing spend? Or do you see yourself competing more on things like margin rates, and deposit pricing? And then are you thinking more about targeting options customers, given your options \u2013 the strength of your options platform or is it not so directly focused on that area?","Michael Pizzi","Yes. Look, I don't have a specific answer to that. I would say \u2013 I would describe it this way, cash offers are here to stay. They've been come part of the industry. And I think that that's something that's just always going to be part of it or less \u2013 the larger clients, especially because they've come to expect it.","And that sort of locks in an amount of that that always needs to be sort of funded and put into your advertising and market development. We've got a great option platform. Of course, we're going to position our option platform as aggressively in the marketplace as we can. We're always out in doing education, trying to get our customers to understand the option market to grow into option trading. We think it's an area of strong retail growth and then we\u2019ll continue to be for a number of years.","Brian Bedell","Thank you.","Operator","Last question is from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Michael Cyprys","Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just on the RIA side of the business, I think today you have over 200 RIAs, $20 billion in assets or so. I guess once you get past the conversion in the second quarter, just curious, what's the asset or RIA capacity of the platform once you get through the conversion? And how much would you need to spend in order to materially increase that capacity? Say if another $20 billion or $50 billion wanted to come online in the third quarter, how much would you need to spend to accommodate that?","Michael Pizzi","Yes. That is the beauty of the integration and conversion. Once we connect to our core middle and back office systems, our scalability of the RIA business is directly in line with the scalability of our main business.","We operate with significant excess capacity obviously for trade volumes and extremely high volume days, which come every now and then. We've got a solid amount of capacity for client accounts and items like that. We're going to scale this business in the same way. It's not something \u2013 that would be \u2013 if we had to add compute power to for the amount of growth, it's not a cost that I'm really worried about if we were to see growth at those levels.","Michael Cyprys","Okay. And just a follow-up question on the technology front. You talked about some of the high level, at least some of the analytical approaches that you referenced earlier. Just hoping you could dig in a little bit more, flush that out around some of the analytical approaches on customer offers that you have in the marketplace. How you are approaching that today and how might you evolve your approaches around analytics around customers over the next couple of years?","Michael Pizzi","Sure. We are investing in data and analytics across the company. We want to learn about our customers, what they want, with the best product set to put in front of them is, how to customize our experience better. I'd say, we've been on this journey for a little bit, but we're really starting to ramp now much more in sort of into those insights, using those insights to drive business, using it to inform our marketing strategy, how and where we place offers, how and where we place our advertisements, things like that. So it's taking a much more data and scientific approach to the problem of marketing that we have ever taken really in the past.","Michael Cyprys","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Okay. And no further questions. So I'll turn the call back to you.","Michael Pizzi","Sure. Thank you all for joining us tonight, and we'll talk to you again soon. Thank you.","Operator","So that does conclude our conference call for today. We thank you for participating and you may now disconnect."],"7959":["E*TRADE Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:ETFC) Q1 2014 Earnings Conference Call April 23, 2014  5:00 PM ET","","Executives","","Paul T.

No other recordings or copies of this call are authorized or may be relied upon.","With that, I will now turn the call over to distinguished, Mr. Idzik.","Paul T. Idzik","Thank you, Brett. Good evening. Thank you for joining us. We had a very positive first quarter with progress across multiple fronts; favorable economic conditions catalyzed retail engagement at levels not seen in years. And we see the opportunities to actively reduce legacy risks. This solid performance gave us the fuel to power our investment engine, as we continued sharpening our focus on the customer and on productivity.","To share some highlights from the quarter, our net income was the highest in nearly seven years. We posted company records across several retail performance metrics. we completed the sale of our market making unit. the team further curtailed our risk exposure capitalizing on opportunities to sell legacy assets and terminate costly liabilities. We continue to execute on our capital plan, recording our third consecutive quarterly dividend from the bank to the parent. and finally, we evolve the public phase of E*TRADE with a launch of a completely revamped platform, Type E*.","Needless to say, we\u2019re quite pleased with how we preformed during the quarter, and more importantly, with the steps we took to improve the long-term positioning of the franchise for our owners. On the risk reduction front, after years of diligently managing down exposures to legacy risks, we capitalized on opportunities to accelerate those reductions. this included the land mark sale of $800 million of TDRs at a gain. We also sold the remaining balance of non-agency CMOs and eliminated $100 million of costly wholesale funding.","Matthew will provide more details on all of this shortly. But suffice it to say that any one of these items of loan would have represented good progress in reducing risk. Along the same lines, we also continue to sharpen our focus on the core business with the completion of the sale of our market making unit in February, adding $76 million to our parent cash position.","A key area of focus since my arrival has been the recasting of our marketing efforts to better reflect how we engage with our customers today. After lots of hard work, mountains of analysis and detailed customer research, we launched a completely new brand platform, which encapsulates our desire to build deeper with our customers, Type E*.","This launch is an important milestone in our ongoing evolution as we work to expand our presence as a trusted destination for advice and assets. This new campaign underscores E*TRADE\u2019s commitment to do more for our customers and also leverages digital media in a way that resonates with these customers.","Additionally, we\u2019ve added new capabilities to more actively track effectiveness, including the customer response. So while, it\u2019s just a few weeks old, we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019ve seen thus far and we\u2019re closely monitoring our progress.","Turning to our results, we\u2019ve recorded earnings of $0.33 for the quarter, our net income of $97 million. Earnings benefited from the robust investor activity, better engagement with our customers and continued reductions in legacy costs. Trading activity was at its highest level in nearly five years with DARTs of 198,000, just below our 2009 company record when market volatility was more than double this quarter\u2019s levels.","Our customers were overwhelming bullish with net buying activity of $3.9 billion in the quarter. The most we\u2019ve seen in nearly two years. Just over 20% of customer trades were in options, a decrease in the past several quarters, where it approached one fourth of our trades.","This shift was driven by a significant ramp up in equity trading, consistent with past periods of Main Street re-engagement. We crossed into the double digits in terms of the portion of our trades executed through our mobile application at about 11% for the quarter. Worthy at note, trading activity is somewhat subsided since quarter-end with DARTs in April to date tracking down a little over 10% from March, but still at healthy levels.","Margin loan balances for the quarter averaged $6.9 billion and exited the quarter at $7.3 billion, the highest levels in more than six years. across growth metrics, we set a record with net new brokerage assets of $4.1 billion, representing annualized growth of 7.5% and we added 72,000 net new accounts, the highest in more than five years, while attrition was a company record-low at 7.1% annualized.","We also showed continued progress and hoping our customers with the retirement, investing and savings needs with the retirement assets up 21% from the prior year, and representing 22% of our net new brokerage assets in the quarter. We continue to see attractive growth in our managed products, which ended the quarter at $2.6 billion, up 11% during the quarter end, up more than 50% from a year-ago.","We also received external validation for the team\u2019s hard work across the handful of recognized outlets. Barron\u2019s awarded us four stars in their annual best of online brokerage feature, including very high marks for research amenities, customer service and education, as well as range of offerings. stockbrokers.com acknowledged our products and services with two first place ratings for No.1 Smartphone App and No. 1 Client Dashboard and five additional best-in-class ratings.","And finally, we were recognized the two Webby Awards for our website and mobile applications, a high distinction for all things Internet. Now well, it\u2019s nice to be recognized for our hard work, the true proof is in what we\u2019re hearing and seeing from our customers. And with retention at an all-time high and engagement at record levels, we feel quite gratified by our progress.","I\u2019d now like to take a moment to briefly address topics that have garnered extensive media attention of late: high frequency trading, fairness of retail investors and the current market structure. E*TRADE was founded on the principle of fairness, with a determination to level the playing field for retail investors. This principle continues to govern our every decision and underscores the company\u2019s commitment to our customers. As a trusted partner in helping retail investors navigate the markets and improve their financial well-being, we take our role quite seriously.","Ensuring best execution for our customers is and always has been top of mind for us. And almost any measure will indicate that it is a great time to be a retail investor, E*TRADE continues in its determination obtain price improvement for its customers. This means that we are helping our customers obtain a better price for their trades than the prevailing market and achieve it frequently.","Last quarter alone, we obtained more than $20 million of net price improvement across all equities and options trades \u2013 direct savings for us customers. Our ability to help our customers realize better pricing is predicated on the current market structure, where multiple trading venues, both on and off exchange attract business through incentive models, exchanging volume for improved prices, payment for order flow and rebates. This model helps reduce overall customer costs, delivering outstanding execution quality.","Internally, we apply great rigor to reviewing this process and conduct regular reviews to ensure our customers receive the best execution quality, including improved pricing. With this commitment to our customers as our top priority, we vehemently condemn efforts by any market participant \u2013 high-frequency or otherwise \u2013 that attempt to gain the system at the cost of the retail investor.","Now turning back to the quarter and before I hand the baton to Matthew, I\u2019d like to say how pleased I am to start the year with such strong results and such impactful actions. On top of our solid performance, we took confident steps to better position in this company for the future. We have a talented group of colleagues and a sound financial strategy in place, and we are evolving our approach to better support our customers, and to me, that sounds like the right recipe.","And with that, I will turn the call over to our allegiant CFO, Matthew Barrick.","Matthew J. Audette","Matthew J. Audette.","Paul T. Idzik","Or Barrick, Audette.","Matthew J. Audette","Thank you, Paul.","Paul T. Idzik","Yes, okay.","Matthew J. Audette","I couldn\u2019t agree more, I\u2019ve been with the company nearly 15 years. And while I look at our resulted metrics, this feels like the best combined quarter we\u2019ve ever had. And in conjunction with the actions we took to improve, the company\u2019s risk profile and financial position, we are off to a great start to the year.","On the results, for the first quarter, we reported net income of $97 million or $0.33 per share, an improvement on net income of $0.58 per share in Q4 and also from $35 million or $0.12 per share in the year-ago quarter. Our first quarter net revenues were $475 million, up from $446 million the prior quarter and $420 million in the year-ago quarter.","Revenues included net interest income of $256 million, up 4% quarter-over-quarter, as Q1 net interest rate improved 7 basis points sequentially, or average balance sheet grew by $400 million. Spread exceeded our expectations as a result of more favorable stock lending results, higher margin balances and the lower prepayments on our securities portfolio.","Given the key drivers of our spread are becoming more and more business and macro-driven, with margin growth, stock loan and prepayment levels on securities becoming the key drivers of our spread changes of late, predicting this metrics is becoming more and more difficult, it can do predicting customer activity, which is nearly impossible to do.","So rather than a spread forecast, which requires predicting those things, I would just highlight the following. If we use the current four curves and assume margin, stock loan and prepayment stay at their current levels, spread would be in the low-to-mid 240s for 2014. Commissions, fees and service charges, principal transactions and other revenue in the first quarter were $194 million, up 10% from the prior quarter and up 18% from the same quarter of 2013.","Average commission per trade of $10.64 was down $0.33 from the prior quarter and $0.66 from the year-ago period. The decrease was primarily due to the mix shift of more equity trades relative to options. Principal transactions revenue was $10 million, which reflected the inclusion of G1X to February 10 when the sale closed. The pretax income on that revenue was less than less than $2 million. going forward, the principal transactions line will be zero and we will see an increase in the fees and service charges line, where we book payment received for volume right into third parties.","And given the recent focus on payment for order flow, I\u2019d like to give a little more detail here. In the first quarter, we received $25 million in payment for order flow. The split was roughly even between equity and options. Net gains of loans and securities were $15 million this quarter, including $6 million related to the sale of the remaining balance of non-agency CMOs. During the quarter, we also terminated $100 million of high cost repo, resulting in an early extinguishment of debt charge of $12 million. We also had $90 million of natural runoff in wholesale obligations.","I would also point out that we have an additional $600 million of obligations set to expire during the remainder of 2014, all scheduled to roll off in Q2. Our operating expenses for the quarter were $290 million in line with our expectations. As a reminder, we expected Q1 to be above our range of $270 million to $280 million, due to seasonal factors and the inclusion of G1X for a portion of the quarter. With respect to investment spend, as we said last quarter, we will continue to be mindful of the operating environment and dynamic in our thinking, maintaining the ability to dial back should conditions warrant.","That said, with current market conditions putting the wind at our back, and with very clear plans, we still feel that now is the right time to invest in the business. Accordingly, we expect expenses for the remainder of the year to be near the high-end of the range.","One final point on the P&L, our effective tax rate in the quarter was 33%, which was reduced by a $7 million benefit related to a recently approved New York State Tax Reform. Excluding this benefit, our effective tax rate was 38%, which is our general expectation for a go-forward tax rate.","Moving onto the loan portfolio, I am quite pleased to report that we sold $800 million of our 1-4 family modified loans, that\u2019s about 10% of the entire portfolio and the bulk of our 1-4 family modified portfolio. Thanks to recent market improvements, we were able to complete the transaction at a slight gain to where the loans were held, because these are TDRs, we\u2019ve reserved for total expected losses through a combination of prior write-downs and reserves in the allowance.","Furthermore, the sale is accretive to earnings going forward, as the benefit from the associated reduction in servicing and FDIC insurance cost will outlay the corresponding reduction in net interest income. This represents the first sale of its kind since the portfolio transitioned to runoff in late 2007. The purchaser is the current servicer of those loans, making this a swift transaction for us and a smooth one for the borrowers. We actually closed on the transaction yesterday.","The TDR sale should indicate that we are always mindful of market opportunities to reduce our legacy risks. But I would note that we do not plan to sell anymore loans in the foreseeable future. This quarter\u2019s provision for loan losses was $4 million, including in $11 million benefit from the third-party settlement. This settlement brings us to the end of a long road of put-back and recovery settlements, which we have actively pursued since 2007, accumulating a total of $450 million, while we continue to pursue one-off recoveries, there is nothing of this magnitude remaining on our radar.","Excluding the settlement, this quarter\u2019s provision would have been $15 million, $2 million less than the prior quarter and at the bottom of our expected range. For the remainder of the year, we expect quarterly provisions within a range of $10 million to $30 million, which includes an expectation for a 4% improvement in home prices.","Charge-offs for the quarter of $54 million, were impacted by two unique items. First, they were increased by $42 million related to the TDR sale, as we charged off the full reserves related to these runs. Second, they were reduced by $11 million in the third-party settlement. Excluding these items, charge-offs for the quarter would have been $23 million, flat with the prior quarter and nearly zero for the 1-4 family portfolio, as impacts have improved term prices coupled with improved delinquency trends offset any new losses on this portfolio.","Specific to our portfolio, home prices improved 1.3% during the quarter, leading to continued improvement in our LTVs. The average CLTV for the home equity book improved slightly to 97%, while the average LTV for the 1-4 book improved 84% due in large part to the TDR sale. The portfolio ended the quarter at $7.4 billion, a reduction of $1.2 billion from the prior quarter.","Excluding the impact of the TDR sale, our portfolio contracted about $350 million during the quarter, which includes $330 million of pay-downs. For the remainder of this year, we expect runoff in the range of $300 million to $325 million per quarter.","Our allowance ended the quarter at $403 million, decreasing $50 million from the prior quarter, while the portfolio was clearly in a better position than it has been any very long time. We continue to be mindful of future conversions in the home equity portfolio.","Currently, there are $700 million of loans set to convert in 2015, and another $1.1 billion in 2016. As a reminder, these loans continue to voluntarily prepay, with the balances converting in 2014 and beyond, having come down by more than 40% over the past three years.","To date, $300 million of HELOCs have converted to amortizing payments. The performance of these loans has been encouraging, experiencing a spike in delinquency in the month, immediately following conversion, but then reducing to a manageable level in the following months, as borrowers adjust their payments to the updated amounts. Keep in mind that those loans that had converted to date represent a very small portion of convertible balance and may not be representative of the performance of loans that will convert in the future. The loans with balloon payments, the losses on conversion have been slightly better than our expectation. Recall that we reserve for our full loss expectation on these loans which is roughly half of the $220 million balance.","Moving to capital and our financial position, we ended the quarter with $525 million in corporate cash, approximately $300 million above our target of two years of debt service coverage. Corporate cash benefited during the quarter from both the $75 million dividend from the bank, as well as $76 million in proceeds from the sale of G1X. And importantly, we submitted our first ever OCC administered stress test at the end of the first quarter. We hope to receive feedback in our submission during the current quarter and it\u2019s our objective to share more with you regarding our capital planning process later in the year. At that time, we also hope to be in a better position to give you some more specifics on our thinking around usage of corporate cash.","As for our capital ratios we posted improvement on our Tier 1 leverage ratios, with the bank ending the quarter at 9.7% with approximately $165 million of capital generation, funding a $75 million dividend and balance sheet growth of $150 million. The current leverage ratio ended the quarter at 7%, up from 6.7% in the prior quarter. We also remain well-positioned under the new Basel III capital rules, which would significantly improve our risk based capital ratios across the board, which are all currently more than double and triple current well-capitalized thresholds.","So in closing we had an enormously positive first quarter. Growth in our business was accompanied by many steps we took to reduce our risk profile. I'm proud of where we stand and look forward to continuing to execute on our strategy and capital plan throughout the year.","And with that, operator we\u2019ll open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And one moment please for the first question. And the first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto. Please proceed with your question.","Richard H. Repetto \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners LP","Yes. Good evening this is \u2013 the question is for the allegiant and implacable CFO.","Matthew J. Audette","Thank you.","Richard H. Repetto \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners LP","So the sale of the TDRs was impressive and I\u2019m trying to get more color on the environment, you\u2019ve sort of warned or implied that future sales warned in the making. But could you go through how this occurred and whether the environment, whether there\u2019s any opportunities say even in the home equity or TDR portfolio to duplicate any of what you did this quarter?","Matthew J. Audette","Definitely, Rich. So the secondary market and being generic the troubled assets space, there has been a ton of buyer interest and demand. So that's the area where we really saw change and you can see that in the TDRs, now you can see in the sale of the remaining non-agency CMO portfolio. So two very good transactions from our standpoint, when I look at the rest of the portfolio, things have not changed.","Especially on the home equity side, the secondary market when we look at those values versus the value for shareholders to keep it and keep managing through it, that dynamic has not changed. The secondary market on the first liens sign just simply when compared to home equity is definitely better, but again that equation of it is, better to keep it or sell it has not changed, as well. So that\u2019s why we don\u2019t view any other sales in the foreseeable future. But I \u2013 from my chair, it does not take away to the positive nature and the power of getting the TDR sale done.","Richard H. Repetto \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners LP","Okay. And then I had the follow-up would be backed in that is another bank today Flagstar up this reserve dramatic or significantly based on its I\/O loan portfolio. and I guess I\u2019m trying to see, you\u2019ve been building reserve for several quarters now on the home equity I\/O portfolio and just trying to see whether there\u2019s any potential like, is this fully vetted whether the reserve policy you have for the home equity portfolio is fully vetted by the regulators and is what\u2019s the chance of having to do a reserve bill like what happened at another bank today.","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. Rich, I mean I am quite comfortable with our reserves, as it is somewhat statement of the obvious. I mean we have a very good and active dialog with our regulators. So I think we \u2013 they understand our portfolio, they look at our portfolio a lot. I think the trends in reserves that you\u2019ve highlighted the trends that we have seen for a while and I would expect going forward, which are slight increases on the home equity side where those I\/Os are and improvements on the 1-4 side. So I think this is another quarter of validating our views that that\u2019s occurring and nothing new from my standpoint that gives me concern about reserves from this quarter.","Richard H. Repetto \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners LP","","Okay, thank you and congrats on the quarter.","Matthew J. Audette","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak. Please proceed with your question.","Steven J. Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you, good afternoon. I guess I wanted to start off with two questions pertaining to the regulatory landscape specifically. The first on balance sheet growth. We\u2019ve seen that some of the tougher regulatory provisions are now being assessed on those banks, really specifically being targeted that those would exceed the $50 asset threshold and you manage to produce some fairly steady earning asset growth and you\u2019re gradually building towards that $50 billion mark. and also if you can give us a sense, when you evaluate the risk reward proposition of tripping the $50 billion wire. does the increase in earnings power as you grow the balance sheet outweigh the more owners\u2019 regulatory burden or vice versa?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes Steve. so before we think about the $50 billion mark, just going back to our objectives and getting our leverage ratio up to 9.5% and we\u2019re now at that and above at a 9.7%, big way in a manner that we got there was through leveraging and having the balance sheet come down. So sitting at $46 billion, having a little over $5 billion of wholesale funding that\u2019s going to roll off over time, I think the primary focus we have and that is getting comfortable with our leverage ratio, getting comfortable through this stress test and seeing where we go from there. I mean $50 billion is something obviously, we\u2019re aware of and focus on, but it\u2019s not the primary area focus for us right now, given that we\u2019re below it.","Steven J. Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay, fair enough, and then focusing on another area of regulation, the LCR, have you assessed your liquidity strength or calculated the LCR based on the latest proposal from the Fed and with achieving LCR compliance require any meaningful changes to how you\u2019re currently managing your balance sheet or simply compare some smaller balance sheet adjustments, such as replacing Fannie and Freddie securities with more favorably treated Ginnie\u2019s?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. So I think in the bucket of a silver lining of our investing strategy is solely and incredibly liquid assets. so when we look at LCR, we look at that very close to what we\u2019ve done, we do pro forma calculations. We don\u2019t disclose that calculations, but I\u2019ll say I\u2019m quite comfortable with our positioning and where we stand on LCR, just given the liquid nature of our balance sheet.","Steven J. Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","","Okay, thanks. And then just one more addition on capital management priorities, I may be jumping the gun here, I\u2019m not given, you said you\u2019re focused on the corporate cash discussion next quarter. But many of us on the call have gone through the exercise of modeling the path towards normalized and I suppose borrowing any negative surprises on credit, the level of capital accretion from returned earnings in DTA utilization over the long-term context is going to be very substantial.","And when we look at the various levers, they\u2019re going to drive earnings accretion and some different capital deployment opportunities whether it\u2019s reduction in corporate debt, on-boarding of the off balance sheet deposits, accelerated reduction in high cost repo or even share repurchase. when you look at all those in a long-term context, how do you prioritize each, and I suppose where considerations are influencing your current ranking.","Matthew J. Audette","","Well made-up question, I mean I think that I\u2019d put in the bucket of, if those things pan out the capital accretion that you highlighted. We\u2019d be in a position to have in a pretty high quality problem of looking at a host of options all of which I feel like would be beneficial for shareholders. So I think the very first part of your question, I think is probably to take away here.","We are looking at all those options, and we hope to be in a position to give you more details on our thinking later in the year. And that\u2019s really all we have to say \u2013 all I have to say today. The only other thing I would highlight is, one of the things that we have been at high on our list that we\u2019re focused on is debt reduction. But again, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ve decided anything. So we\u2019re helpful later in the year, we\u2019ll give you more details on the thinking.","Steven J. Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay, fair enough. That\u2019s it for me and congrats on a very strong quarter.","Matthew J. Audette","All right. Thanks.","Operator","","And the next question comes from the line of Chris Harris. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Harris \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","","Thank you. Hey guys, so a follow-up question on credits. Matt, you had talked about the HELOCs and that there has been some prior experiences of HELOCs that have converted to their amortization period. I know it\u2019s a really small sample size, but can you give us an idea as to what those initial loss rates were and those are about $300 million bucket.","Matthew J. Audette","","Yes. So it is the all very small numbers, right, it\u2019s a few hundred million. I think that the main point I would make without getting into the details of the numbers is it\u2019s managed or there are small amounts and we do see a spike in delinquency in that first month and then you see it come right back down to a manageable level, still a little bit higher than it was before it converted. but at a manageable level, which to us speaks to someone who has got a payment on automatic bill pay, just didn\u2019t realize the payment was going well; once I noticed that, they corrected me in the vast majority come back down. So my standpoint, they\u2019re manageable numbers, but it is a very small sample. and so it\u2019s not necessarily indicative a much.","Christopher Harris \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","","Okay, yes, I understood. And then a follow-up question on a different topic, I guess payment for order flow, we appreciate you guys providing the level of detail that you do, it\u2019s more than most. But I\u2019m wondering, I know there\u2019s a variety of sources of payment for order flow whether it\u2019s selling the order flow wholesalers or whether it\u2019s rebates from exchanges. Is there anyway you guys can give us a little clarity on what percentage of the payment for order flow falls in each of that buckets \u2013 each of those buckets and kind of reason I\u2019m asking is that the selling of the order flow to wholesalers doesn\u2019t seem to be that much of a focus, but there is some regulatory focus on say, doing something that may take.","So having that breakout would be really helpful for us to start and assess full kind of risk we could be looking at.","Matthew J. Audette","Yes, so Chris with given the amount in the breakout between equities and options is probably as helpful as I\u2019m going to be, we\u2019re not breaking anything up beyond that.","Christopher Harris \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay. Maybe one final question that on the business. You guys have been turning favorably for quite some time now. And really what\u2019s sticking out and this isn\u2019t really a new phenomenon but your attrition rate being kind of at record low. Do you guys think there\u2019s any more upsides to this number, or do you think kind of where you have it now, is kind of a reasonable level to expect going forward, because it gets much lower than that and you guys are going to be looking at competing with some of the best-in-class numbers, I think.","Matthew J. Audette","Well, we certainly don\u2019t hope to see an uptick in that number, we certainly hope that it stays steady or goes down a bit, right? I\u2019ve given how reported. That\u2019s very difficult for us to predict. I think we\u2019re doing the right things to engage better with our customers. You see our net new account grows at attractive levels, net new assets. And important to us is not only keeping the attrition number at an attractive rate, but growing the existing customer relationship. So I think that\u2019s all we can really say on this topic.","Christopher Harris \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay, got it. Thank you.","","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein. Please proceed with your question.","Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good afternoon guys.","Matthew J. Audette","We know your name Alex?","Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Thanks.","Matthew J. Audette","(Indiscernible) currently.","Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","I\u2019m used to that. As Joe and I\u2019ve heard worse. So on the leverage ratio you guys are at 9.7% at the banks, so clearly above your 9.5% target. I guess what needs to happen for you to kind of come back to the regulators to see if you could adjust the amount of capital you could dividend back to the bank. And then also \u2013 sorry back to the ALCO, and on the flip side do you need to actually get a regulatory approval if you decide to bring some of the deposits back or is it just a function of what we have access capital at the bank, we don\u2019t want or we can\u2019t dividend to the ALCO, we could bring some of these deposits back? How would that process work?","Matthew J. Audette","So it would all be part of the capital planning process and discussion Alex. So I would look at them together, we have a very good and active dialogue with our regulators on discussing a host of matters. And when we look at the short term nature of capital distribution, which includes the level of the leverage ratios at 9.7%, our short-term plans are still the same, in the prior quarter up to the amount of the prior quarter bank earnings. The longer-term plans are still the same to close down 50 basis points a year from the 9.5% per year beginning this year. But the big next step for the big next process for us is really focused around the stress testing.","So that is submitted, we really hope that this quarter is a good quarter of dialogue and back and forth putting us in a position to or putting us in a position to speak with more specificity later in the year on this exact topic, so that\u2019s our goal to work towards that. So we\u2019ll talk later in the year.","Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay got you. And then shifting gears to the business for a second, clearly, really strong organic growth I think one of the best we\u2019ve seeing from you guys in a while. Maybe you guys could spend a minute just talking about the sources of those net new assets coming in, whether that\u2019s some of the existing clients, where you staring to gain a little bit more wallet share I know that\u2019s been the strategic priority for you in the past or is it winning business from some of the competitors?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. So I\u2019ll take the first out and then sure Paul can carry on that. So net new assets at $4.1 billion, definitely it\u2019s I mean the record quarter for us. I think the new verses existing roughly a fifty-fifty split and so nice $2 billion number on each. I think the general sources of this new assets really hasn\u2019t changed, meaning there\u2019s not a bunch of assets moving in back and forth within our sectors it\u2019s really assets coming over from the traditional space to our space. We\u2019ve seen that for a very long time I think this quarter just validated to us and that is continuing.","Paul T. Idzik","So that\u2019s good.","Matthew J. Audette","All right.","Paul T. Idzik","Yeah.","Matthew J. Audette","And that\u2019s good.","Paul T. Idzik","So that\u2019s good.","Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","All right. Great, last quick number question to margin balances clearly strong for everybody really exiting the quarter, wondering if you could provide where things stood on margin balances in April.","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. So, as Paul covered in his prepared remarks trading has gone down in the month of April around 10% versus March. Without giving a number on margin, margin has largely held in where we ended the quarter.","Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it, great. All right, thanks a lot guys.","Operator","","(Indiscernible) that was Mr. Blostein. And the next question will come from the line of Mike Carrier. Please proceed with your question.","Michael R. Carrier \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Hi, thanks guys. And then, may be first question just on the interest spread outlook and somewhat related to the sale and I understand your comments on with margins, stock loan, it is more volatile, in terms of the outlook. Just any color on what the impact on the prepay side was. And then when we think about sale and then also the reduction in wholesale funding and then, the reduction in FDIC and service cost. Can you just go through some of those items in terms of what the impact will be or the offsets to get to somewhat of a neutral impact or positive impact to this P&L.","Matthew J. Audette","","Sure. So, in general on the TDR sale, I mean, it has three impacts, a little of a decline in net interest income going forward and a bit of an improvement meaning a decline on the expense side on both FDIC and servicing. All those three things together I\u2019d characterize as a slight benefit going forward. On the prepay and security side, so prepayments and securities continue to be at incredibly low levels for us. So there were roughly a 7 CPR in Q4, which was incredibly low that came down even further in Q1 of a 6 CPR, a level at which you would even with really no rate incentive to refinance, a level at which you would expect to be higher.","So if those prepayments stay that\u2019s part of my scenario, on spread going forward in the low to 240s. That\u2019s one that is incredibly difficult to I predict, which is one doing it. But it is a very low number and was a low number in Q1.","Michael R. Carrier \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. and just a follow-up, in terms of the investment spend, we think about on the technology side on the head count side, just in terms of what that should be driving in terms of the revenues. So whether it\u2019s net new assets in bringing money in, something on the trading side, whether it\u2019s mobile or new strategies. Just I want to get a sense and then if you do start to get slippage on the revenue side, how quickly can some of that be pulled back.","Matthew J. Audette","","Well, we are \u2013 I\u2019d say our investment spending is in three broad categories. The first is in technologies you mentioned, that\u2019s quite important for us to stay. At the right level of technological innovation and stability that our customers expect and I think you\u2019re seeing us go over 11% for mobile trades this past quarter, it is indicative of the type of things we need to do to help our customers do the things they want to do. The second category is advertising spending year-over-year. We\u2019ve launched a new platform, we\u2019ve launched in the way that we think as quite smart. We\u2019re engaging more robust in a digital frontier and that has meant an increase in there. And third is in talent, we\u2019ve added teams and individuals in the marketing area and technology et cetera. And certainly, we had to add teams as we continue to improve our regulatory standing and respond to the request that regulators have for us as we go forward on our business.","Those costs are recently dirigible, the area that\u2019s less controllable of course is the things we do to respond to regulators, but we certainly have the opportunity to use the term tabs on both technology spend and advertising spend as the revenues warrant what we do and drive what we do. The type of things you are starting to see that those drive are the net new accounts more growth from existing customers, lower iteration. So you should look that we certainly keep our eyes on those targets and those categories of indications that our customers are responding to what we are doing.","Michael R. Carrier \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","","And the next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan. Please proceed with your question.","Devin Ryan \u2013 JMP Securities LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon. So, just want to follow-up on the trespassing, trying to get a little bit better sense around the timing and I guess the progression of dialogue with the regulators. It sounds like you are expecting feedback this quarter. But just given that they are already pretty incrementally familiar with the portfolio and capital plan. Do you expect that at that point where you get that feedback if you\u2019re comfortable with the test that you will receive approval to move forward with that capital plan relatively short order or is that piece of feedback is part of the bigger process in your views with the back-and-forth carried on for some time thereafter.","Paul T. Idzik","We have closed and fairly continuous dialogues with our regulators including submitting a multi-year capital plan, which they are very intimate with and we submit our stress test in March. The requirement was we use Q3 2013 numbers for that. It\u2019s the first time, we were required to officially submit a stress test, but it\u2019s not the first time that we\u2019ve shared stress test results with the regulators because we run that as a matter of being good business people.","So, as Matthew said, it\u2019s our objective to share more with you regarding our capital planning process later in the year. We like to better tell you when we actually know better what we are going to be able to do and we look forward to having a constructive dialogue around that subsequently.","Devin Ryan \u2013 JMP Securities LLC","","Fair enough, okay. And then, just also wanted to just circle back on the strength in DARTs that you have been experiencing recently and also the slight change in mix that you saw with higher cash at a derivative as a percentage, and I\u2019m just trying to get a better sense of are you seeing that longer-term investor, we are engaging. It seems like the active trader has continued to be active, but I am just trying to think about that the engagement that we are seeing for long-term investor and do they feel more entrenched today with today with margin balances increasing or just still feel pretty fragile to the extent we saw some volatility. I know it\u2019s difficult to predict, but while we get a little more color there from what you guys are seeing now from the actual investor basis within your customers.","Paul T. Idzik","Well, I would say the number that indicates how Main Street\u2019s feeling is that increase in equity trades relative to absence trades and as we\u2019ve been tracking and about 25% option trades in prior quarters and was down to 20% because the cash equity trades where much higher. I spent quite a bit of time with customers. And I would say they realize they really need to put their money to work, but the level of uncertainty with what\u2019s happening around the world and still some of the economic indicators are leaving them bullish about needing to invest, but still really keeping their eye on the dashboards and paying probably more attention to what has been happening then, we might suspect otherwise.","Devin Ryan \u2013 JMP Securities LLC","","Got it, okay. And then, just lastly with respect to the loss on the earlier extinguishment of debt to $12 million loss that resulted from the decision to terminate the $100 million in wholesale funding. Did that seem like a little bit large penalties of just curious would drove that decision whether we could expect there to be similar termination of contracts moving forward.","Paul T. Idzik","Sure. So, just looking at the wholesale book overall if you go back, before we started focusing on deleveraging, we had about $7 billion book. And we look at that from the perspective of overtime, we want that to run down, which it will also and if there is anything we can do to accelerate that, that makes sense economically. To make sense from a capital ratio standpoint we want to do that. And we did about $1.5 billion of that during our deleveraging focus. What we saw, we saw an opportunity this quarter on a specific charge of $100 million, the $12 million prepayment penalty should really indicate that was very high rate stuff, meaning while the penalty was high, the benefit going forward should also be high. So, it\u2019s just something that we thought made sense to do, put in the bucket of accelerating balance sheet clean up. I was very happy to do it, very excited about it bring wholesale down to $5.2 billion, we\u2019ve got another $600 million that are maturing on their own next quarter, bring it to the $4.6 million. So all in all I feel good about wholesale and I feel good about the transaction.","Devin Ryan \u2013 JMP Securities LLC","Great. I appreciate the color and congrats on a strong quarter.","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) And next question is from the line of Chris Allen. Please proceed with your question.","Chris J. Allen \u2013 Evercore Partners","","Hi, good morning guys.","Paul T. Idzik","Good morning.","Chris J. Allen \u2013 Evercore Partners","I just wanted to ask about the fees and service charges and their sequential increases, I\u2019m assuming some of that\u2019s driven by increased pay forward with the Q1, but I was wondering if you can give any color on that and just have to think about the run rate moving forward.","Paul T. Idzik","Yes. Chris, I mean, that there is two basic quarter for those by far the biggest item in net lines. The $25 million of payment quarter fall at $47 million. So, that line large are going to move with customer activity. And the second biggest item in there is really recurring fee income related to assets that we manage primarily the net. But, it is predominantly payment for quarter meaning it\u2019s going to move the volume.","Chris J. Allen \u2013 Evercore Partners","Got it. If I mean assuming if there was a fourth quarter, the number would have been couple of million dollar above that in terms of payment for order flow of $25 million, would you (indiscernible).","Paul T. Idzik","Yes. I mean, I would put that in the bucket of noise. It\u2019s only five weeks of the quarter and that we had UNX so it will be would be buyer stuff a little bit, but not meaningfully.","Chris J. Allen \u2013 Evercore Partners","Got it. And any thoughts in terms of what would happen if I mean, there restructuring and the quarter fall I mean, any thoughts in terms how you might monetize your order flow or how the impact of modification of the trade outlook if there was a implementation of a trade-off role would impact the payment for your guys.","Paul T. Idzik","First of all, we are committed offering our customers value beyond price through customers service, education professional guidance. And we believe are offering is really compelling and competitive. If anything happens in the competitive landscape we would evaluated at address it at that time, but I cannot really speculate on what is to happen in that space.

No other recordings or copies of this call are authorized or may be relied upon.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Idzik.","Paul Idzik","Thank you for joining us, and good evening. We had a good second quarter characterized by continued brokerage growth, noteworthy de-risking of the balance sheet and encouraging progress in our regulatory dialog.","In the core franchise we continued to sharpen our focus, strengthening our foundation and raising the bar internally on quality. This quarter that took the shape of launching our new brand platform, delivering a clearer message to our customers and prospects regarding the breadth of our capabilities. It also took the shape of focused investments in talent and infrastructure, positioning our company for future success.","The quarter brought continued accumulation of accounts and assets even in the midst of an industry-wide slowdown in trading activity. And with respect to our overall risk and financial position, the quarter benefited from the completion of the landmark sale of modified loans and marked improvement in the composition of our investments and funding sources. And perhaps most importantly, we made meaningful progress with our regulators, completing our first ever Dodd-Frank stress test.","Starting with that topic, since many of you have expressed more than casual interest; during the quarter we received feedback from our regulators with respect to our stress test submission. Matthew will share some of the details, but to foreshadow a bit, the dialog with our regulators on this topic has been quite healthy across both key dimensions of their assessment.","First, in terms of how our actual numbers fared, meaning capital adequacy and liquidity across various scenarios of macroeconomic and environmental stress; second, in terms of our planning process, our methodologies and stress testing capabilities.","With respect to the first, we performed well under all stress scenarios, and we feel positive about our capital position over the test period. On the second, we were encouraged by the dialog surrounding our stress testing capabilities and methodologies, our planning process, risk management and controls.","Over the past several quarters, you've heard us talk a lot about building out our enterprise risk management framework. Our stress testing capabilities are a prime example of this build out as we work to ensure our processes and procedures that met the expectations of the current regulatory environment and of our owners.","Net-net, our stress test results were as good as we could have hoped for. As you can appreciate, we view the entirety of this process to be an important step in our regulatory dialog, and importantly our continuing progress prosecuting our capital plan.","Turning to our financials, we recorded earnings of $0.24 for the quarter and net income of $69 million. Earnings benefited from an elevated net interest spread and the continuing trend of diminished credit costs. Expenses of $284 million were down sequentially, and while reflecting ongoing investments in the business, including elevated marketing spend corresponding to the launch of our new brand platform and its surrounding promotion.","Now, as we think about expenses, we remain confident that investing is the right thing to do at this time. We're also very conscious of pressures to revenues and the need to balance the bottom line impact.","Accordingly, we continually assess the appropriate level in areas of investment for the current environment. And while one quarter of muted activity does not make a trend, we're prepared to tighten our belt should revenues wane for a sustained period of time.","Further during the quarter, we exhibited continued improvement in the complexion of our balance sheet with reductions in legacy investments and funding. We completed the landmark sale of $800 million of our modified loans and rolled off $600 million high cost wholesale funding as those obligations reached their scheduled maturities.","Now, in terms of brokerage metrics, DARTs were 155,000 in the quarter, down 22% from a five-year high in the first quarter, but up 4% from the prior year. Options as a percentage of total trades were 23%, and our customers continue the increasing trend of engagement via mobile devices with a record 11% of trade executed to our award winning mobile apps. Finally, trading has held up July to-date, which has been up 3% from June.","One final point on trading; while the public discourse in this topic has calmed, our focus on delivering the best possible execution to our customers has and always will remain our top priority.","During the second quarter we were able to achieve price improvement for our customers of slightly over $20 million. That number is consistent with last quarters, but on lower volume, meaning we did an even better job of helping our customers get better pricing on the orders they placed with us.","Customer margin receivables remain relatively constant during the quarter ending the period at 7.3 billion and averaging the same throughout the quarter. These were again the highest levels we've seen in many years. We did however see some mild yield compression here as the number of accounts leveraging margin reduced, while the balances per account grew.","We added $1 billion of net new brokerage assets during the quarter. As expected, the pace of additions slowed relative to last quarter's record, reflecting seasonality in April. We added 33,000 net new accounts in the quarter, bringing our total year-to-date beyond the total for the entirety of 2013.","Our annualized brokerage account attrition of 8.6% edged up a bit from the prior quarter's all time low, but was still one of the lowest quarters in the company's history.","Meeting the retirement, investing and savings needs of our customers continues be an area of intensified focus for us. To that end, we were very encouraged with the continued growth in our managed products ending the quarter at 2.9 billion, up 11% over the prior quarter and 62% over the prior year. Retirement assets also accounted for the bulk of our total net new assets in the quarter.","At the board level, we were fortunate to add Mr. Gary Stern as the Director during the quarter; significantly strengthening our skill set at the board table. Gary's background having spent 27 years as President and CEO of the Minneapolis Fed is especially relevant, given the focus of the company.","With regard to external validation, we were recognized by J.D. Power during the quarter as our overall satisfaction index showed more improvement than any other provider in the self-directed space. And importantly, we received upgrades in each of our three credit rating agencies, DBRS, Moody's and S&P; these upgrades reflecting our progress across many fronts.","So in summary, I'm pleased with what we accomplished during the quarter, and feel good about prospects for the future. We've done a lot to bolster our position in the brokerage business, including our recent brand platform launch and intensified focus on the customer.","We also remain clear-eyed and purposeful in working to strengthen the financial health of the company for the more robust balance sheet shape and the continued execution of our capital plan. We feel encouraged by the regulatory dialog around our stress testing, which has been especially rewarding, given the amount of energy my colleagues have devoted to enhancing our risk and regulatory position over the past several years.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to our assiduous CFO, Matthew Audette.","Matthew Audette","Thank you so much, Paul. I certainly echo your sentiment on the quarter in our overall position. We have great momentum internally and externally as evidenced by the strengthening of our franchise, the improving health of our balance sheet, our regulatory progress, the confidence our customers continue to place in us and our performance overall. And I'm especially pleased that our progress is starting to be recognized by our rating agencies with positive actions during the quarter from each.","So, to start with our results; we reported second quarter net income of 69 million or $0.24 per share. The decrease from net income of 97 million or $0.33 per share in Q1 and an increase from a net loss of 54 million or $0.19 loss per share in the year ago quarter, which included 142 million of goodwill impairment.","Our second quarter net revenues were 438 million, down from 475 million in the prior quarter, and 440 million in the year ago quarter. Revenues included net interest income of 270 million, a 2% sequential increase as Q2 net interest spread improved eight basis points to 255 basis points, while our average assets decreased by 700 million.","The strong spread this quarter was driven by a combination of the core business as well as some balance sheet actions. On the core business, despite an industry-wide decline in trading activity, our margin and related stock blending book were robust during the quarter with even higher average balances than in Q1.","On the balance sheet side, we had several factors impacting the spread, including the scheduled runoff of 600 million of wholesale borrowings, which reduced the overall size of the balance sheet, strong performance on non-accrual loans and the one-time benefit to loan yields related to the TDR sale. While we were quite pleased with this spread performance in Q2, the benefit to the TDR sale along with the strong performance on non-accrual loans are not likely to recur in future quarters.","In addition, prepayments on the securities book picked up towards the end of the quarter as summer moving season started to kick in, something that is likely to continue into Q3. So, factoring in the likely decline in loan securities yields and assuming margin and stock loan remain at Q2 levels, our spread would be in the mid 240s for the second half of 2014. Please keep in mind, this is not a forecast, it's more of our run rate on the spread as we exited the second quarter.","On balance sheet size, this quarter's decrease was driven by the reduction of wholesale funding along with customer activity, which included 400 million in net volume. This brought our balance sheet down to just under 46 billion. There has been some interest recently on our expectations for future balance sheet size. We've been around our current balance sheet size of 46 billion since late 2012, which is reflective of two things; first, we were focused on de-leveraging to bolster our capital ratios. And second, we deliberately remain below the 50 billion threshold, which is still our intention today. We're quite comfortable with our ability to manage the balance sheet size accordingly to leverage such as those we've utilized in the past.","Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenue in the second quarter were 161 million, down 13% from the prior quarter and up 3% from the year ago quarter. Average commission per trade of $10.72 was up $0.08 from the prior quarter and down $0.38 from the year ago period. The sequential increase was primarily related to more options trades in the mix along with more trades from our corporate services customers.","Fees and service charges revenues of 46 million included 22 million of payment for order flow, compared with 25 million in the prior quarter. This reflected a 19% decline in total trades in the first full quarter impact of the sale of G1X.","Net gains in loans and securities were 7 million this quarter, the majority of which related to the TDR sale. The prior quarter's gains of 15 million included 6 million related to the sale of our remaining non-agency CMOs.","Our operating expenses for the quarter were 284 million, down from 290 million in the prior quarter. The decrease relates primarily to the fact that G1X was included for a portion of Q1, and FDIC expense declined 5 million sequentially, largely due to the TDR sale. These declines were partially offset by increases in compensation and professional services.","As Paul mentioned, our advertising spending in Q2 was higher than normal as we launched our new brand platform type E. Our plans for full year marketing spend are unchanged at roughly 10% increase from 2013. We've just focused more of our spent in the first half of the year in 2014.","In considering our overall expenses I'd echo Paul's comment that we're mindful of the environment with thinking about our own investments under different operating conditions.","From where we stand today, we still believe that make sense to invest, so we will continue to do so. As I think about the metrics that we used to gauge the appropriateness in us, we had solid momentum across a number of this. Spread has increased in the lows, partially due to healthy margin loan balances, an indicator of customer engagement. Credit has improved relating to lower provision and FDIC expense. And our corporate interest expense has come down with a possibility of further declines. So all trading activity has come down has over the past three months. That isn't the only indicator of our ability to invest.","Now, given our frontloading of marketing spend and the seasonality of the second half of the year particularly Q3, we expect overall operating expenses come down slightly from this quarter's level during the remainder of 2014.","Moving on to the loan portfolio, we had ended the quarter at 7.1 billion, a reduction of 325 million from the prior quarter driven by 310 million of payments. For the next few quarters we expect runoff in the range of approximately 300 million per quarter.","This quarter's provision for loan losses was 12 million at the low end of our expected range. This is down slightly from Q1 which would have been 15 million excluding a third-party settlement. Our allowance ended the quarter at 401 million essentially flat with the prior quarter.","Charge offs for the quarter are 14 million were predominantly in the home equity portfolio as one- to four-family charge-off was zero, which is consistent with last quarter adjusting for unique guidance.","As we think about provision expense going forward, we are mindful that the majority of our HELOC portfolio converts to amortizing over the next few years. To take a step back we think about our home equity portfolio in three separate categories when it comes to reserves. The first is balloon loans of 210 million, for which we are already reserved for the full life of loan.","The second is, home equity installment loans that's 600 million, which have always been amortizing. And the third is home equity lines of credit of 2.3 billion, the majority of which are not amortizing. It's this third category where we generally reserve for the next 12 months loss expectation and where conversions are scheduled to pick that materially in 2015 which could cause provision expense to increase in the quarters surrounding conversion.","And additional point on provision expense is that we've had essentially no charge-offs in the one to four portfolio over the last couple of quarters, which has caused our reserves for that category come down to keep overall provisions low.","With the current allowance for this book now relatively small at 44 million, there is not much more room for this trend to continue. So we expect provision expense for the rest of 2014 to be predominantly driven by the conversion of HELOCs and to continue to be within the range of 10 million to 30 million per quarter. Actual results within that range will be driven by the performance of conversions relative to our expectations.","One final point on the loan portfolio, home prices improved approximately 5% during the quarter leading to continued improvement in our LTVs. The average CLTV for the home equity book improved to 94%, while the average LTV for the one to four book improved to 81%.","Moving on to the regulatory front, as Paul mentioned, we received feedback from the OCC on our stress test which were submitted at the end of the first quarter as part of the first wave of Dodd-Frank Act stress test for banks of our size.","The submission was based on September data and included our operating forecast through 2016 under varying scenarios. The most constraining being severely adverse which contemplated inputs such as the 40% drop in the equity markets, and the 25% drop in home prices.","Since the results for banks in the 10 billion to 50 billion range are not public for this first official test. I can't discuss much in a way at specific results. But as Paul mentioned the two key takeaways are; first, we remained meaningfully about the regulatory low capitalized levels for all capital ratios across all scenarios. And second, we were quite satisfied with the feedback around our stress testing process and our approach in methodologies.","In all, we feel incredibly good about what we've accomplished here; our considerable efforts to de-risk and de-leverage are proving their worth with our strong capital performance across all scenarios. When coupled with our company-wide focus on building out our stress testing capabilities and controls over the past couple of years, achieving results like these is quite gratifying.","One final point in our submissions, keep in mind that they were based on September 30th, 2013 data. Since then our risk profile has improved. Through solid earnings the continued runoff of legacy assets and funding the sale and elimination of remaining non-agency CMOs and most important our sale of 800 million of modified loans reducing a disproportionate level of tail list.","Turning now to what this means for our capital and dividend plans going forward? The stress testing process for banks of our size differs in the CCAR process. So while the completion in response to these stress test is great progress, includes an important hurdle. It is not of length in approval of our capital plan. Each dividend request will continue to require a formal approval on a quarterly basis.","As we focus on our longer term capital plan while this stress testing process and its results are a key milestone equally as not more important will be demonstrating sustainability in the processes we had built, specifically in enterprise risk management, meaning, it's a great progress that build out our ERM framework that it will be even better when we can demonstrate a sustained operating track record.","So while our longer term plans continue to include managing the bank to a lower Tier 1 leverage ratio of 8% ultimately, our near-term plans are to continue requesting quarterly dividends of consistent amounts. In light of our regulatory dialog including the feedback on our stress test, my hopes are unchanged in wanting to be in a position to have more clarity on our path to our longer term plans by the end of the year. I think the accomplishments of the past couple of quarters only bring us closer to this objective.","Turning now to the use of dividends; we've been spending a significant amount of time thinking through what is the best use of capital. After much thought and analysis we believe the best use of capital today is to reduce our parent company debt. This is consistent with our commentary over several quarters now and is reflective of plenty of recent work on the topic. However, keep in mind that while this is our thinking today, this can, and likely will evolve over time as we get more clarity around our dividend levels and the returns in other uses of capital improve.","I'd like to add a little more color on current thinking around debt reduction. While we believe reducing debt is the best of capital today, we are also mindful that paying off our debt entirely, all 1.8 billion of it would likely result in a costly and inefficient capital structure. The key question therefore becomes how much reduction should we target. After much work in reviewing a host of different measures including earnings capacity, competitive measures, regulatory capital guidelines in credit rating agency data, to name a few. We believe the right level of debt for us over the long-term is approximately $1 billion.","This means, based on our thinking today, we would ultimately pay off 800 million of debt. The timing of and our ability to reduce debt by this magnitude will depend on several factors. Most importantly the level of dividends from the bank to the parent in cost associated with paying down our existing notes. I don't have precision around our plans today, but I hope to be in a position to provide more clarity on actions later in the year. As a reminder on year's callable debt is the 2017 notes which are callable in November of this year. Our nearest maturity is May of 2016 when 435 million comes due.","Overall, we feel strongly that reducing our corporate debt will put us in a much stronger financial position and will drive shareholder value. But again please be mindful that changes in the environment could shape and change our views and there are multiple constituencies involved in these decisions including our board and regulators. We are focused on executing our capital plan in getting into a position to reduce debt.","In closing, it was a solid quarter for us. We meaningfully improved our risk profile in our recognition our efforts with upgrades from all three credit rating agencies. We made good progress with the regulators on our dialog around the stress test and the receipt of our fourth consecutive quarterly dividend. And I feel good to be talking with more specificity on our plans for use of capital. I look forward to continuing and evolving that dialog in the second half of the year.","And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto. Your line is open, please proceed.","Rich Repetto \u2013 Sandler O'Neill","Yes, good evening. First question is for the assiduous CFO here. Matt, I didn't quite -- when you talked about the balance sheet size, you said it was deliberate to keep it at 46 billion, but what I didn't get or maybe I just didn't hear you. But does that include going forward that you're going to do everything to stay below a [specific] (ph) type situation at the bank? Or how do you balance that with growing the balance sheet and producing more net interest income, but you're having more expense side if you hit that 50 billion mark?","Matthew Audette","Yes. So Rich, so in speaking to our views today, it's been a big focus of ours to get the balance sheet size down, to get the capital ratios up, specifically the leverage ratio. And a secondary focus of staying below 50, I think over the long-term things of course could change; the returns on those deposits could change. Our wholesale funding, we still have 4.6 billion of that that's scheduled to roll off over time which creates a bunch of capacity to bring deposits back on balance sheet, so really speaking to our views today knowing that over time they can certainly evolve.","Rich Repetto \u2013 Sandler O'Neill","Okay. I know that they could evolve, I guess, quite well. If you do want to get to, say, 300 basis points spread in a different environment, it just appears like the balance sheet would need to be bigger. Anyway, I'll ask one more like a follow-up question. Thank you for the discussion on the debt and the ideas and thoughts on capital usage.","I guess the question is when you say if the environment change like what else, what type of environment would you not want to take down the debt level or where that target would change and that would not become 800 million of debt reduction not be the priority where you might do some other capital return whether it be dividend, buyback or etcetera?","Matthew Audette","Yes. So hopefully the message is debt reduction is absolutely our focus. I think the key thing to always keep in mind is we're going to be focused on what is the best use of capital for shareholders. Those things could change. I think just using the topics that we were just discussing, the return on deposits, especially there is deposits of balance sheet in this interest rate environment with the level of FDIC costs that we had in running the bank at 10.2% leverage ratio, the returns on that could be dramatically different with higher levels of interest rates with 8% leverage ratio, and FDIC rates is cut in half. So things could evolve over time. But I want to be very clear that our focus today in the best use of dividends is to reduce debt of the parent.","Rich Repetto \u2013 Sandler O'Neill","Okay. Thanks and congrats on a good quarter.","Matthew Audette","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein. Your line is open, please proceed.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for a lot of color and a lot of details I've seen there on the call. But let's -- I wanted to go back to the capital question.","I guess on the one hand you guys still have significant amount of excess capital at the bank today. So by our math it's about 300 million. And it looks like there is also a significant amount of excess cash at Holdco today, which should enable you to pay down the debt that's callable this year. So I guess what I am trying to get to is it feels like there is flexibility in the interim to deploy some of the excess capital at the bank without necessarily funneling it to the Holdco. So can you discuss, I guess, that opportunity and what really goes into that decision, because there is a couple of things you guys could do obviously both on the deposit front or breaking down the wholesale funding front?","Matthew Audette","Sure, Alex. So I think on the near-term focus on capital levels and use of capital, we are really focused on continuing to generate capital earnings at the bank and dividend being in a position to continue to dividend those specific amounts. When we get to the longer term plans that are being able to start to run at a lower leverage ratio that's going to involve reviewing a host of different things, I hope to be in a position by the end of the year to get more specificity and details on that.","I think the core of your question is because we're above 9.50% is there some flexibility to do something with every dollar above 9.50%. It's not as black and white with that. We are focused on having healthy capital ratios at the bank continuing those consistent dividends and getting to a place where you can achieve the long-term. So that's where we are focused.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Thank you for that. And then the second question I have for you guys is the discussion around provision guidance. In the $10 million to $30 million, I guess, the view is -- that's your expectations for the next couple of quarters assuming unamortizing loan book and the losses there perform as expected. Can you give us a sense of what that 'as expected' is? I don't know what sort of loss number that you are assuming or something else that we can use as to gauge the performance of that book relative to your expectations?","Matthew Audette","The short answer is no, Alex. I think the longer answer though is that the range of 10 to 30 is of course informed by our views. I think if you look at just the last couple of quarters on home equity, the provision for the home equity component or book itself has been around 20 million which is coincidentally right in the midpoint in the range. So we'll obviously see it over time, but in the 10 to 30 is the best I can give you.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Got it. And just one more from me, on spread income real quick; if you look at securities lending that's been, I'd say, surprise for the last couple of quarters. How sustainable you guys think that incremental revenue you have seen within NII and securities loan for you?","Matthew Audette","It's tough to predict. I mean it's margin and securities lending go pretty much hand in hand. So I think it's in the same bucket of how well could we predict whether the Q1 DARTS we're going to hold steady as well, right? So it's very hard to predict. We're obviously very happy with it. But it would just be hard to predict.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak. Your line is open, please proceed.","Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities","Hi, good afternoon.","Matthew Audette","Hi, Steve.","Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities","I was hoping to spend a little bit of time dissecting your logic or rationale as to why you are reluctant to grow the balance sheet above 50 billion. And I recognize that there is a risk of incurring incremental SIFI-related expenses. But just taking a step back and looking at the progress you've made on the risk management front, you have all of the capital and liquidity stress test systems in place including the regulators are pleased with your progress. I'm simply just talking to identify what are the potential sources of incremental expense that would compel you to limit your growth to the bank beyond 50 billion, because based on all of the cost benefit analysis that we do, that's the opportunity that's most accretive.","Matthew Audette","Steve, I think we've been incredibly clear about our primary objective which is to get the leverage ratio at the bank (indiscernible). So in order to do that we have reduced the size of the balance sheet, a secondary objective there has been to stay under 50 billion. Our objectives remain the same of continuing to maintain that leverage ratio at the bank till we get to a place where everyone involved is comfortable that's migrating to that longer term capital plan.","I think another thing that's very important for us, the amount of time and energy and effort that we spend on enterprise risk management, highlighting the stress test build out as we have today, but another key thing for us is demonstrating sustainability in the things that we've done. So it's not just important to build something out. It's important to build it out and show that we can do it over time. There is lots of things to do, but I think we have shows over the past couple of years, we've laid out a very long-term plan, in each quarter that goes by, feel like we are continuing to make progress on it.","Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities","Okay. So presumably if there is sustained progress that's made and you demonstrate that to regulators, is there any reason that you will then still be reluctant to grow the balance sheet beyond 50 billion? I'm just trying to identify whether is an individual source or area of incremental cost that you simply haven't incurred as of yet that makes you reluctant to consider that alternative?","Paul Idzik","Steven, I think there is certainly a bit of incremental cost you would expect to see in legal compliance risk and some in IT. We are talking about theoretic right now. We are pretty clear there have been underscoring today that our intent is to stay consistent with our capital plan and to really work on that and to stay below 50 billion. I am encouraged by the fact that in Washington and around the country there is recognition that a bank that's 50 billion or 55 billion doesn't have the complexity of $250 billion bank. There is some healthy discussion which I think has been well balanced about how do we think about that level and how might that change, and as well as all banks of X billion dollars are not of the same complexity.","So we are very happy to keep driving value for our owners by prosecuting our capital plan and to maintain a watchful eye on our opportunities, but also maintain a watchful eye on the regulatory and political environment. We are pretty happy with that current stated course of action.","Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities","All right. That's certainly fair. I do appreciate that color. Then just one more from me on the detail relating to your -- to managing your corporate data, and, Matt, I do appreciate the additional color you provided there. I just wanted to get a sense as to how the trust preferred is actually fit into that whole plan, and whether an improvement in your credit rating would actually prompt you to reduce the level of targeted debt.","Matthew Audette","So the tougher parts are rest that are in the bank but in their current regulatory environment. They are still included in good Tier 1 capital up at the parent. Obviously that is being phased out starting in 2015. I think what we've said today trust preferred are considered capital, so they are not on our focus.","I think whereas to your second question on where our ratings go? Is that going to change our thoughts and level? Yes, I think the \u2013- our in the level of debt is after reviewing a host of different measures and is our view on the right level of debt over the long-term. I think if you just look at the financial results and the balance sheet that we've been producing and extrapolate that out. The credit rating associated with that over the long-term I think would be quite good. So we thought that through and thinking through the right level of debt at $1 billion.","Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities","Okay. And actually just to -- relating to the first question on the troughs, I know that you do have one trench that's actually quite expensive, which if you are going to maintain that level of billion dollars of debt outstanding, presumably you would want to take out at least some of those higher cost trenches, I just want to know how that would fit into the overall strategy?","Matthew Audette","I put that in the bucket of tactics, Steven. I don't have any comments on that. I mean we are well aware of course of the trust preferred. We are well aware that one of them has got a 10% coupon on it. It's a very small amount. I'll put that in a bucket of tactics that we will deal with at a later time.","Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities","All right. Fair enough. Thank you for taking my questions.","Matthew Audette","Sure.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier. Your line is open, please proceed with your question.","Michael Carrier \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys. Hey, Matt, first on expenses, I think you mentioned just on the 284 level just going forward that kind of pull back some -- in that range of 275 to 280, I want to get some color. And then if the environment does remain muted in terms of the levers that you have to pull back it because most of the advertising -- are there other line items that you guys have invested some -- that you could pull back if this lasts for a couple of quarters?","Matthew Audette","On where expenses are heading, I mean if the trend is down slightly and really highlighting the seasonality of marketing where we are focused on spending roughly 120 million for the year but we spend 70 million of it in the first half of the year. And then of course typical Q3 slowdown in volumes, you'd likely see some sort of movement in that direction as well meeting down on the clearing cost. So I think that those are things to look at. If we were to conclude we needed to pullback. I think marketing is always the most obvious one, but I think when you look at the areas that we are investing in is largely associated with people.","So if you look at where our expenses have grown, it's in a combination of comp and professional services. And there is a very specific -- many specific thought processes is by and one of them is to have enough in professional services that if it does make sense to pull back. We've got the type of spend that we can pull back as opposed to doing it all through -- pull some employees. Well, that's a little bit more difficult, a little bit more costly to pull back. So I think we've got that right balance for many reasons, but one of them is so we can be a little bit tactical if necessary.","Michael Carrier \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's helpful. Paul, I may have just a follow-up. I think over the next few years, two years, you got outside on the provision side, the capital deployment once you get approval. When we think about on the top line in some of these investments that you are making, if I look out over the next two, three years where do you see the most maybe a reward for that investment? Is it on the net new asset side and some of the fee-based products? Is it on more accounts on the trading side or is it on the retirement side? I was just trying to get a sense of where you kind of see that top line going?","Paul Idzik","We are in the yes\/and category there. First of all, we think we can do a better job, and as we reposition the brand, do a better job of capturing more over existing customers assets particularly retirement assets and longer term investing assets.","Secondly, I think you've seen the numbers. We are doing a better job already attracting net new accounts and that's obviously a combination of bringing in new accounts and retaining, keeping our attrition low. So we are thinking about working both sides of that P&L if you will, both side is what comes in on the revenue side.","Let me just give you an example of where the investment spending is very tangible, very oriented towards the doing a better job as a digital company, being a bit smart about how we go about things. The team has gone through and redone in a very sophisticated way in terms of doing customer testing etcetera or online application. And we've increased the hit rate, if you will the funding rate on that online application from 50%, so half of the people who started in actually funding their accounts to 58%. That's quite a terrific increase, and we are looking for further opportunities to make it easier for people to do business with us and therefore bring us more business.","In addition, we think there is some real opportunities to improve the octane mix, if you will of the average customer by continuing to add financial consultants prove to excellent dialog with customers in helping them identify their needs are growing the portfolios that we help those customers with and helping those customers organically grow their portfolios and make better informed and smarter decisions about their financial health. So we are not looking for just one line as we improve our relationships through our customers. We are looking for progress across a multiple number of revenue lines.","Michael Carrier \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Chris Harris. Your line is open, please proceed.","Chris Harris \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thanks. Hi, guys. The whole topic around you guys need to demonstrate sustainability in your risk management processes, I'm wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit more guidance around that. How long do you guys have to demonstrate that sustainability before you can do a little bit more with your capital?","Paul Idzik","Well, I'd say the sustainability issue is not a single point in time issue. As our regulators get a better understanding of what we do and a more fulsome understanding of what they want to accomplish across the industry. Those expectations change. We are very gratified for example that the skills and talent we built around stress testing have resulted in our regulators providing us feedback that indicates they are comfortable that we have a sustainable process with which to do the stress testing. That's very important as I said earlier, not only to our regulators, but certainly to our owners. I don't think there is any easy answer to what constitutes sustainability, because our regulators expect us to be improving what we do on the risk management compliance front, logically expect us to improving that everyday.","We certainly are seeing indications from the regulators that they are taking this very seriously and even the largest institutions are discovering you can't take your eye off the ball in this.","Chris Harris \u2013 Wells Fargo","Is it fair to say that that process could take multiple years?","Paul Idzik","It's not a multiple year issue in terms of our build out. I feel very good with the build out we've done. But as I said, the sustainability issue is not one that just stops today. New regulations come in the force, we add new product lines, we add new products the regulators are going to want to see us build compliance and control around that and demonstrate sustainability over time. It doesn't just stop at a certain point in time.","Chris Harris \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay.","Paul Idzik","There is no time clock on our intent and our great desire to improve our relations and are standing with our regulators and there is no time clock and them having a very logical desire to continue improving the safety and soundness to the financial institutions around this country.","Chris Harris \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. Then as it relates to the dividends how do the bank \u2013 bank's net income has been over $100 million for the last two quarters and the dividends still remains at 75. I'm just wondering why there is that slight difference. Why you guys can't -- at least dividend and the net income up? Then related to that why can't you at least dividend and capital to get you back down to the 9.50% ratio like why the regulators want to see this now 10% plus Tier 1 leverage at the bank?","Matthew Audette","Chris, a couple of things, first, it's only -- it hasn't been too long since we didn't have any dividends at all, right? So this is the fourth quarter where we already have dividends, and we are in incredibly good position to have that. I think our view on dividends and what we have expected over the short-term, that has been very clear in a consistent range. Our view in dividends over the longer term, I think we've been very clear in where we want to go. And our getting between those two points, we're working on and we hope to be in a position to have more clarity by the end of the year. I think having a bunch of different steps and why we're not doing exactly this amount of dividends or that amount of dividends is not something I'd comment on. I think our near-term plans are clear, our long-term plans are clear. I think we have a great track record of executing well, and that's where we are focused on.","Chris Harris \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. Just one quick point of clarification for me regarding the flexibility on paying down the debt; just so I'm clear, the amount that's available today, I assume that's just all in the corporate cash bucket, 570 million or could you potentially source cash from other places?","Matthew Audette","No, that's the total amount. And keep in mind; we wouldn't bring that down to zero, right? We wanted -- historically, and our view is to keep at least two years of debt service coverage up at the parent, which would be around $220 million at our current debt level. So we wouldn't take it down out to zero. But that is the primary source of cash with that reduction.","Chris Harris \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay, helpful. Thank you.","Matthew Audette","Yes.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Devin Ryan \u2013 JMP Securities","Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. Most of my questions have been asked; maybe just one on the brokerage and it looks like another pretty solid account add quarter, and you obviously had a really robust first quarter. With respect to all the changes that have occurred here with marketing strategy and I believe there are some streamlining to the account opening process. I mean, are we actually starting to maybe see some traction tied to that yet, or has the recent momentum just been more related to the environment unless some of these things that have actually changed internally at the company?","Paul Idzik","I think that's an insightful question, thank you for that. Just like we had a discussion earlier on similar topic, we want to see several more quarters of this type trend before we're happy with believing that some of the changes we made are sustainable. But certainly having net new accounts pass the mark we had in all of 13 already this year is a good sign. We're seeing positive progress in our customer satisfaction and feedback from customers.","And further I think we stack up pretty well on many of the metrics against our competition. So we're feeling better about what's happening. We have a lot of work to do. No one is putting down tools here. So I'd say stay-tuned, but I think we're on the right path.","Devin Ryan \u2013 JMP Securities","Okay, great. And with respect to just the headcount growth, obviously 4% is still a pretty robust number, and you guys did alluded to this with the investment spending, but can you just give a little more detail around where that is specifically located? Are these revenue driving seats versus maybe some catch-up on the support side, and is there still more hiring to come or do you guys already gotten there now that you have headcount up, I'd call it 10% year-on-year?","Paul Idzik","Well, first of all, as we add new accounts etcetera in that we need to maintain customer service levels and as we're engaging more richer dialog with our customers and trying to provide greater level support as they entrust us with higher asset levels, we need to add financial consultants. So, there is definitely some additions in the customer-facing side. We've continued to add staff on the compliance, risk and legal sides as the environment continues to change as we've needed to do more in both the advertising space. We've talked about wanting to be more analytical and smarter about what we're doing and shifting the focus of what we do in marketing to be more focused on our customers, less advertising focused and more customizing around our customers and prospects. That requires not only marketing people, but technology people.","So, those are the areas we're doing hiring in. And as a company that tries to support and does successfully support its customers not only with online channels, but with a dedicated high quality team of professionals, the definition around E-Trade of what's customer-facing and what's not customer-facing is a little blurred. I mean I think I'm really proud of working at a company where a great majority of my colleagues believe they're getting up everyday to make the customer's lives better and they will attract more customers.","Devin Ryan \u2013 JMP Securities","Okay, great. And then just with respect to the capital -- I apologize to beat the dead horse here, but I just want to make sure that I'm clear, so the regulators, are they necessarily waiting to monitor your risk management processes further here, before they potentially allow you to move forward? Is that what we're waiting for or we're just still having that dialog and it could happen at some point in the near future, but we just don't know the exact date? And I guess following on that, are you interacting with the same group at the OCC that review the stress test on this front as well?","Matthew Audette","So, I think on the path from here. I mean I think the new information this quarter is our comment on the stress test. We said last quarter I hope to be in a position by the end of the year to give comments on our view on when and how we'd head to the longer term capital plan. That's the same comment this quarter. So really nothing has changed other than we've gotten to the stress test.","So, I think the fact that our capital ratios increased through the wholesale reduction, wholesale funding reduction and customers were net buyers of the balance sheet didn't actually grow during the quarter has pushed the leverage ratio up about 10%. And I think the focus on what do we need to do to be able to use that incremental piece of -- interim piece of capital I think is missing a broader picture, right? We're heading towards the longer term capital plan; we've been headed to that capital plan for quite some time.","So that's what I'd take away from this. As far as who we interact with, we have -- I feel like we have great relationships at the OCC and the Fed, we interact constantly and have very good dialog.","Devin Ryan \u2013 JMP Securities","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Chris Allen. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Chris Allen - Evercore Partners","Good evening, guys. I just wonder if you could tell us what the one-time benefit in the loan book that's showed up in the loan yield this quarter was.","Matthew Audette","Yes. So, there is a couple of things, and you may have noticed in the delinquency tables, we had delinquent loans maturing at a much faster pace in the second quarter. So, to the extent those are non-accrual, you can add some periods where you get more than one interest payment in a period.","And then second on the TDRs, we had a subset of those that were on non-accrual as well. When we sold those, we were able to get paid for the total amount of accrued interest. So, creating a little bit of a boost in the yields during the quarter, but if you look at the trends going back to in Q1 were it's just below 4% and it popped up during the second quarter, everything else being equal I'd suspect it would go back down in Q3 to the levels we saw in Q1.","Chris Allen - Evercore Partners","Got it, okay. And then, in the past you've given us some metrics around the HELOC book in terms of voluntary prepayments. I'm wondering if anything has changed in that front, is it still close to the same levels we've heard in the prior quarters, and the credit quality as people trying to amortize, does that remain steady or is there any change in that front either?","Matthew Audette","Yes. The short answer is nothing new. On the home equities the metrics have been -- approximately 40% have made voluntary payments of around $500 more in the last year, about half of those, 2500 or more. So nothing has changed on the performance of those that have gone through the end of draw. The comments there are the same. It's just such a small population that extrapolating anything from that to the larger population that is going to become amortizing, 15 and 16 is something that we think makes sense to do.","That being that, we're encouraged by what we see in that population that once you hit the end of draw period, that there is not some dramatic credit shoe to drop. But again it's a small population.","Chris Allen - Evercore Partners","Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse","Good evening, Paul. Good evening, Matt. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of questions on some of your longer term initiatives, would it be helpful to get a progress report on some of those initiatives, I'm particularly interested in your initiatives to deepen customer wallet share, any metrics around progress that would be helpful?","And then secondly, how should we think about the longer term cost implications of your push towards mobile fee-based platform? Should we expect some pressure on operating margins as you invest to grow or can you preserve core margins, how wide you transform the platform?","Matthew Audette","So, I think a couple of things I'll address there, Christian, on deepening the customer wallet. I think a good tactical example is our managed products. We continue to grow those at a much faster pace than growing our overall assets. We're up to 2.9 billion in those accounts in the second quarter versus 2.6 billion last year. And those are the types of things where you think about the classic assets and customer that we'd get long ago. They would likely have that type of money, buy they would keep it elsewhere. They're starting to bring that type of money to us. I think that's the type of thing you'd see on deepening the customer wallet.","From a fee-based platform, there is no dramatic or broad cost implications of that. I think there are lot of things on -- lot of the areas that we've investing that Paul touched on earlier, whether it's customer-facing, technology or people, they're working on trading type assets as well as a fee-based type assets. I don't think there is a broad cost-based implication to the extent that we're successful in that.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse","Okay. You don't think you (indiscernible) transform increasing number of financial consultants, etcetera, I guess is my question.","Paul Idzik","We feel very positive about the pay back period related to the specifically the addition of the financial consultants, and I just want to remind you that one of the things that we found frustrating a little while ago was the fact we weren't doing a stellar job of explaining to existing customers the breadth of our offerings. And I'm encouraged based upon some customer focus groups that I've personally attended as well as some of the data that the customers are starting and process the starting to understand the breadth of E*TRADE's capabilities much better than they ever had before. And I think as you see the net new assets coming in both from brand new customers and from existing customers, that message is starting to resonate.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse","Great, that's helpful. I guess my second question on payment for order flow, just given some of the focus around non-marketable equity limit orders and the rebates they have gotten from exchanges would just be helpful to get your views and how you get comfort around your practices here?","Paul Idzik","We have extraordinarily thorough practices in our order routing that have been reviewed at the highest levels of the firm and include independent experts who take a look at that. We feel very, very comfortable with what's happening there. And we believe in all likelihood in many cases we're operating at or near best practices across what we do.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon. (Operator Instructions) Mr. Fannon, your line is open. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Fannon - Jefferies","Great, just one from me on longer term expense trends. Clearly you've highlighted the investments that you're making today and ongoing, but in an environment where -- the revenue environment is still okay and volumes are tracking at levels now, do you think 2015 still represents an area for which they'll still be spending in areas like professional fees and hiring or does that where we start to see a bit more of the leverage in the model?","Paul Idzik","Well, first of all, welcome to your first call.","Dan Fannon - Jefferies","Thank you.","Paul Idzik","Thank you for joining. We're already starting to see some of the benefits of our investment. Certainly as we continue to grow accounts, you'll see us have to add professionals to support those customers. A significant amount of our build outs have been in many areas, but much of that depends upon our continued analysis of what we need to build out as well as what we can afford. We're certainly not spending money simply because we've had a good couple of quarters. We're spending money with the intent to be able to support the brand as we're now portraying it to our customers and to shift the way we serve those customers, both online and over the phone and in-person.","So, it's not a linear relation between just a couple of variables, it's an attempt, and successful attempt to-date. It's starting to change the P&L dynamics of our company. So I think you have to stay with us for several calls, and you'll see what will start to happen.","Dan Fannon - Jefferies","Great. And I guess one more follow-up just on the FDIC expense, it seems like the benefit this quarter you highlighted was from the sale, and should we just assume the trend in that associated with the runoff in the portfolio, or are there other variables that could result in step functions or changes in that trajectory?","Matthew Audette","So, over the longer term, we'd expect it to come down by half. I think in the shorter term if there are any tactical things like the TDR -- sale of TDR portfolio; they're impacted in a meaningful way. I think the short answer to that is no. I mean when you go through the details of the account, the higher risk assets where there is a surcharge for those, the TDRs were disproportionately high when you look at the rest of our portfolio.","So, I would view the current rate which was $19 million and also roughly 19 basis points on assets is about where I'd see it in the near-term, keeping in mind if we continue to do the things that we've been doing, the bias on that is going to be a lower rate, not a higher one.","Dan Fannon - Jefferies","Great. Thanks for answering my questions.","Operator","And we have no more questions at this time.","Paul Idzik","We'd like to thank everyone for joining this evening, and hope you have a pleasant evening. Bye-bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude that conference call for today.

No other recordings or copies of this call are authorized or may be relied upon.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Roessner.","Karl Roessner","Good evening and thanks to everyone for tuning in. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full-year results call. This January call typically provides a natural point to pause and rehash 12 months of accomplishments, while looking forward to what the next 12 may bring. While I will provide somewhat of a retrospective, this moment in time is defined by executing with intensity and focusing on our charge to grow the business. So while we may be at a natural reflection point, we are anything but paused. After laying out a plan in late Q3 to refocus the Company on brokerage growth, this past quarter we marched forward in devising, and beginning to implement, the many tactics to deliver on that plan, positioning the Company for success.","To quickly recap the 2016 highlights, we built solid momentum and closed the year as a leaner, more focused, more agile organization, well-positioned from a financial and capital standpoint.","We entered the year lowering the bank's target leverage ratio by 100 basis point reflecting the continued improvement in our risk profile and our regulatory position. We distributed a significant amount of capital to the parent, and seized opportunities to accelerate our share repurchase program, buying in more than $500 million dollars worth of our shares. After bringing our balance sheet to nearly $50 billion, we announced our decision to grow through that threshold, and began the work of building out the structure to support that growth.","We delivered a commitment to our investors to be responsive to the revenue environment, shifting our investment philosophy to an operating margin framework. We managed the legacy loan portfolio through the bulk of the loan conversions from interest-only to fully amortizing, effectively removing the largest remaining credit risk overhang.","We completed our first major acquisition in more than a decade, jump-starting a transition back to our scrappy brokerage roots, and realigned our business to be more nimble while achieving meaningful cost savings.","And finally, we laid out concrete and tangible growth goals for the Company.","To this last point, I will turn to our key areas of focus that we believe will drive our growth, all of which I will subsequently expand on.","First, finalize the OptionsHouse integration, and realize the full potential of this combination. The team, customer base and functionality we acquired are vital to reaching our growth goals. The integration activities began the day after closing, and we are tracking to plan. But this process is about much more than personnel and infrastructure. At its heart it is about our customers, and ensuring each and every one has access to, and appreciation of, the best of what we have to offer across platforms.","Second, breathe new life into our marketing. As I've mentioned before, our challenge is not one of brand awareness, but one of perception. As such, we are hard at work developing a plan to move the needle on our brand identity, better positioning E*TRADE as a home for both active traders and long-term investors, and doing so in a thoughtful, effective, and typically irreverent way.","Third, take advantage of our operational leverage. In no uncertain terms, our commitment to be responsive to the revenue environment in our spending remains the bedrock of our plans, even as we look to accelerate growth. We have a powerful, fully scalable model, and we continually evaluate opportunities to further optimize our cost structure and investments.","And fourth, continue to dispassionately assess opportunities for efficient capital deployment, including reviewing inorganic growth prospects. As our earnings profile strengthens, so too does our capital generation and our prospects for its deployment. While we are focused on balance sheet growth, and plan to resume share buybacks later this year, we will continue to review all value generative paths for our shareholders' capital, and adapt as the environment evolves.","This list is far from exhaustive, and in some ways it's just the tip of the iceberg. With a small handful of folks focused on assessing potential opportunities, the majority of my team is working hard to maintain momentum on the charge forward to meet our growth objectives. And to reiterate those targets, in the short- to medium-term, we aim to improve our account and asset growth rates by 200 to 300 basis points, which, using Q3 as the starting point, would equate to a brokerage account growth rate of 4.75% to 5.75%, and annual brokerage asset growth about 100 basis points higher than that. We aim to shift the mix of our trades to be 35% in derivatives predominantly in options but also including a significant increase to our futures volume. And we plan to grow our managed assets to $6 billion.","To review our current state, this quarter, we grew brokerage accounts at an annualized rate of 2.8%, and brokerage assets at a rate of 4.7%. 29% of our fourth quarter trades were in derivatives, with roughly 27% in options. It should go without saying that integrating platforms and expanding our offering to customers is paramount to growing this metric, as is enhancing and fully integrating our futures offering.","On managed assets, we ended the period with $3.9 billion, including around $240 million in Adaptive Portfolio accounts. We continue to see significant opportunity for growth across these accounts, with the right marketing and customer positioning.","Our most immediate and impactful goal is to complete the OptionsHouse integration. I am pleased with our progress, and feel good about our plans for completing this. The two remaining components platform integration and clearing conversion are both slated to occur in Q3. We aim to deliver superior active trading capabilities to the combined customer base, incorporating the best of both offerings, and we have the right folks in technology and product focused on delivering just that.","And while delivering an exceptional digital experience is in our DNA, we must never rest on our laurels, and must always seize opportunities to improve. The integration affords us a unique moment in time to review our entire digital offering with a fresh perspective, and a few new sets of eyes, to further captivate our customers.","On marketing, we've restructured the team and installed new leadership with deep industry experience. We've also aligned the department within the brokerage business and positioned the new team to ensure they are focused on our key success metrics. And at the top of a long list of initiatives is the re-launch of our brand. We've enjoyed phenomenal brand awareness, and we intend to build on that to reclaim our challenger position in the industry. Expect to see more around mid-year. In the meantime, we are working on updates to our website, including an overhaul to the look and feel, along with improved navigation. Further, we are working to listen, understand, and respond to customer feedback in much better ways. We are off to a solid start, and I'm excited for our customers to experience the changes that lie ahead.","With respect to operational efficiency, of the utmost importance to us, and to me personally, is remaining highly mindful of how we spend our shareholders' money. Part and parcel to this is our op margin commitment. During 2017 we will manage to a target of 38%. This number is adjusted to exclude provision for loan losses, which has been a significant benefit to earnings for the past six quarters. But importantly, it includes all planned costs related to balance sheet growth and the OptionsHouse integration.","Mike Pizzi will provide additional details on this, but I cannot stress enough that under my watch we will be steadfast in our expense discipline. If we identify areas for investment which expand beyond this target, we will have to fund them through additional savings found within the business.","And finally, on capital deployment, we continue to focus on opportunities to drive meaningful value through prudent stewardship of our shareholders' capital. We have two very well established capital initiatives for 2017, growing our balance sheet, and resuming share repurchases.","We officially commenced the first, and as of this morning we can boast roughly $52 billion in consolidated assets. Our plans have us reaching $57 billion by mid-year, slightly higher than our original assumption, and ending the year around $62 billion. This avenue has only increased in attractiveness over the past quarter as rates rose and the amount of available deposits grew.","Further, with all the chatter around regulatory requirements, and thus costs, possibly being eased under the new administration, we are hopeful this path could become even more compelling as the year progresses. In addition, as a savings and loan holding company, the timing to comply with the enhanced bank holding company requirements has been extended relative to our original assumption. We now expect we will have until 2019 to become compliant with CCAR, resolution planning, and certain other onerous and costly requirements. Separately, the Fed also announced a one-year LCR compliance phase-in period for banks newly crossing $50 billion.","And regarding the second initiative, as I previously mentioned, we intend to resume share repurchases in the second half of the year.","On a separate, yet concurrent track, we continue to evaluate opportunities for inorganic growth. To be certain, I am confident in our Company's organic prospects, but vigorously support our responsibility to evaluate inorganic opportunities, as our platform offers immense scalability, and additional opportunities remain.","To provide some color on the primary areas that warrant our attention. First, brokerage. Given the scalable nature of the brokerage business, opportunities that afford additional account and asset volumes typically present attractive economics. However, there is a noticeable lack of inventory in what I would call the traditional category at present. We continue to keep our eye on opportunities that can present new capabilities to our customer base.","Second, stock plan. We have a top-rated equity compensation platform and could easily add scale to it. We continue to look for opportunities that can expand the scale or add scope to what we offer to our corporate clients and their plan participants.","Third, wealth management. This could provide a natural extension of our existing cash management and banking capabilities that we offer to our brokerage customers and stock plan participants. We have an acquisition channel into the high net-worth segment of the market, but fall short on capabilities to service them following an exercise of stock plan assets. Further, the expansion of cash-related capabilities could prove valuable, particularly as we've unshackled our balance sheet growth.","And finally, advisor services. This space is quite broad, but our focus is on RIA platforms as they could further our asset and account growth capabilities and leverage much of our existing infrastructure. While we would be a late entrant, the RIA channel continues to be a high-growth segment within our industry. If we deem that the RIA channel is compelling, entering via acquisition would be the only feasible route at this stage.","To be clear, we are not pursuing a transformative transaction and any potential acquisition would be viewed through our capital deployment lens. My management team and our Board are extremely focused on the appropriate use of, and return on capital, and we will hold that focus as we evaluate inorganic growth opportunities. Also, as we demonstrated with OptionsHouse, we will be diligent, and anything we pursue would support our core business and align with our digital ethos.","Turning now to our results. Net income of $552 million or $1.98 per share represents our best year since 2006. It also includes a net benefit of $0.33 per share related to provision and income tax benefits, partially offset by executive severance and certain restructuring costs. This reflects our commitment to meticulously manage expenses, the wind-down of our legacy loan portfolio, which outperformed our expectations greatly, and the strength of our business model, even during a period of tepid growth.","As for metrics, 2016 was a curious year as the markets opened in January and February with one of the bigger selloffs in recent memory, regained their footing, and then went on a rally following the election, with major indexes reaching all-time highs. Meanwhile our customers opportunistically sold during periods of positive market activity, particularly around Brexit and the election, marking the first full-year on record they were net sellers.","Our DARTs for the year were 164,000, up 6% from 2015 with derivatives representing 26% as compared to 24% in the prior year. These increases are related to OptionsHouse, which is fully reflected in our Q4 metrics. As for January, our DARTs are currently tracking up 8% from December, including a nice bump yesterday as the DOW hit a historic high.","Customer margin balances ended the year at $7.1 billion, up from $6.8 billion at the end of Q3. After hitting an intra-quarter high just after the election of $7.3 billion, they trailed off over the last six weeks as we saw additional customer net selling.","For the year, we added 105,000 net new brokerage accounts, excluding the OptionsHouse acquisition, and the impact of shutting down our Hong Kong and Singapore operations, representing 3.3% growth and a record-low attrition rate of 8.4%. This is a modest improvement from 2015 levels.","We brought in $9.4 billion of net new brokerage assets during the year, representing a 3.8% growth rate, flat with 2015 levels.","In closing, it was an important year for E*TRADE, but as I said earlier we're very much in the thick of things when it comes to the work we have to do. As 2016 was a year of refocus and resolve, 2017 will be a year of execution. We've brought the Company back to its core brokerage roots, embraced our digital spirit, and have become more nimble. We've begun to define who we are and we're working to incorporate a strong message in our marketing to connect with and re-engage traders and investors alike. I'm excited to be leading a fantastic team of committed professionals. When I took over this seat about four months ago, we established an aggressive timeline, and the ensuing sense of urgency remains ever-present within our walls. It's only been a quarter, and I won\u2019t pretend that our metrics yet reflect our efforts, but I fully expect we will go a great distance in the year to come.","And with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Mike Pizzi.","Michael Pizzi","Thanks, Karl. For the quarter we reported net income of $127 million or $0.46 per share. That compares to $139 million or $0.51 per share in the prior quarter and $89 million or $0.30 per share in the year-ago quarter.","Revenues for the quarter were $509 million, up $23 million from the prior quarter, reflecting the first full quarter impact of our acquisition. Year-over-year, revenues were up $70 million primarily related to OptionsHouse, a larger balance sheet, increased customer cash, a better interest rate environment, and organic growth in trading activity.","Net interest income was $288 million, flat with the prior quarter as both our balance sheet and net interest margin held relatively steady. Net interest margin of 260 basis points was slightly above our expectations due to a better interest rate environment, and an increase in average margin balances. Rates rose on both the long and short end of the curve and while that benefit wasn't fully reflected in Q4, it's a meaningful positive for us going forward. Our average reinvestment rate is currently in the 225 basis point to 250 basis point range, which is consistent with where it has been following the post-election bond market sell-off.","In terms of forecasting full year NIM, if we hold margin rates and interest rates flat with where they ended Q4, grow the balance sheet at our planned pace, and assume no rate increases during 2017, we'd expect NIM to land in the range of 250 basis points to 255 basis points. However, if we project a Fed Funds increase in June, as the market broadly assumes, and a corresponding increase in term rates, this forecast would improve by around 10 basis points.","Commissions revenue of $122 million increased $15 million quarter over quarter. DARTs increased 24% sequentially and our commission per trade decreased $0.55 to $10.42. The reduction in average commission per trade reflects the full quarter impact of OptionsHouse, and thus provides a good go-forward run-rate.","Fees and service charges increased $12 million quarter over quarter, driven by a full quarter of OptionsHouse as well as additional fees from cash held off balance sheet. There are a number of moving parts on this line in 2017.","First, once we complete the clearing conversion, OptionsHouse margin balances will move onto our balance sheet and begin earning net interest income as opposed to fees and service charges.","Second, as we move customer cash from third parties on to our own balance sheet throughout the year, the associated revenue will similarly be recognized through net interest income.","Third, we assume the rate earned on third-party cash will increase from around 45 basis points during 2016, to around 70 basis points for the full-year 2017, assuming a sustained better interest rate environment.","Finally, we will realize the full-year run rate associated with OptionsHouse order flow revenue.","Other revenues increased $1 million sequentially to $11 million. Securities and other gains were $8 million, down from $14 million in the prior quarter, which spiked as we took advantage of Brexit-driven market volatility. As we grow the balance sheet this year, we expect fewer opportunities to realize gains and thus expect the 2017 quarterly levels to be roughly $5 million.","We recorded a provision benefit of $18 million in the quarter. The allowance reduced by $14 million to end at $221 million, as net charge-offs were a recovery of $4 million. With the loan portfolio now at just $3.8 billion, it is a mere fraction of our total assets. HELOC conversions are 85% complete as of year-end, and will be more than 95% complete at the end of Q1.","Moving on to expenses, non-interest expense for the quarter was $322 million, down $1 million sequentially. This quarter included $7 million of restructuring costs primarily related to OptionsHouse, and $2 million related to crossing fifty. The prior quarter included $6 million of executive severance and $25 million of restructuring and other acquisition-related activities. Adjusting for these unique items, non-interest expense increased $21 million, primarily from the inclusion of OptionsHouse for the full quarter.","Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was above target at 37%. That number excludes provision benefit of $18 million, but includes about $9 million of non-recurring costs primarily related to OptionsHouse and the $50 billion initiative.","With respect to our operating margin guidance for 2017, as Karl highlighted, we are targeting 38% inclusive of all planned one-time costs related to the acquisition of OptionsHouse, and the build-out of our systems and personnel to comply with heightened regulatory standards. We are not modeling any movement in the Fed Funds rate, though we recognize that broad-market expectations include at least one increase during the year. If this does occur it could provide either upside to our operating margin or an opportunity to invest further in the business should the returns be appropriate.","Looking forward to a sustained better rate environment, we expect our operating margin to settle in the mid 40% range, which reflects our belief that in a stronger rate environment, a rising tide lifts all boats, and increased competition and investment needs would likely be a reality to keep up with the business environment.","I am happy to provide this all-inclusive number, but I also recognize the desire for investors to track our progress on the one-time expenses we've laid out. So, to provide further insight, we announced expected deal-related costs to total $52 million, and incurred approximately $15 million in 2016. Now, with more clarity around the integration, we expect that total number to be closer to $46 million, with approximately $22 million to come through in 2017.","Similarly, connected to the balance sheet expansion, where we initially outlined $50 million in total implementation-related charges over two years, with work well underway, we have refined our estimate. Our updated assumption is for roughly $20 million in implementation-related costs over the next two years, with approximately half of that in 2017. We continue to expect the recurring component to be $15 million annually.","In terms of timing and trajectory, we expect our first quarter op margin to be in the mid 30% range, pressured by seasonally higher marketing and compensation-related expense, along with elevated non-recurring costs. However, as we realize the benefit of a larger balance sheet, and the integration progress leads to synergy capture, we expect it to improve throughout the year, exiting the year with Q4 in the low 40% range.","As for capital, during the quarter we distributed $150 million up to the parent, comprising $100 million from the broker and $50 million from the bank. For the full-year, we moved an impressive $858 million up to the parent, including $435 million from the broker. We expect ongoing distributions from the broker to be in line with excess capital generation, which was $70 million in Q4. That's the amount we intend to move in Q1.","The bank distribution was again below its prior quarter earnings of $118 million as we retained capital to fund planned balance sheet growth. In 2017, we plan to consume a meaningful amount of capital at the bank and grow the balance sheet. Accordingly, our current plans include a halt to dividends from the bank to the parent until 2018.","Sticking with our balance sheet, we ended the quarter at $49 billion, with customer cash held by third parties at approximately $17 billion. And pro forma for the OptionsHouse integration, about $13.5 billion of those balances are readily available to move onto our balance sheet. We crossed the $50 billion mark the first week of January and as Karl noted, today we are at approximately $52 billion.","Crossing the $50 billion threshold has been an important part of our plan since the middle of last year and has grown increasingly more attractive over time. While the political landscape has infused meaningful uncertainty into the future of regulation, we continue to plan for full compliance under the current framework. That said, if the $50 billion threshold were meaningfully raised, and the requirements surrounding CCAR, resolution planning and LCR were eliminated for companies of our size, the associated costs could further reduce. Hypothetically, if we were to limit our regulatory build-out to only the elements we believe we should address in any case, we believe our current assumptions for roughly $20 million in implementation costs, plus $15 million in running costs, would reduce to around $15 million upfront and $10 million ongoing.","Now, as for the timing of growth, it will be dictated largely by the amount of available capital. We ended the year the with bank Tier 1 leverage ratio of 8.8%, implying about $275 million of capital in excess of 8.0%. Our plan remains to lower the bank leverage ratio to a targeted minimum of 7.5% this quarter, and we are in active dialogue with our regulators on the topic. At that point, the parent leverage ratio, with a targeted minimum of 7.0% would become our binding constraint.","So in summary, we have a lot going on. I'm excited about where we are, what we have in the works, and the opportunities that lay ahead.","And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","And our first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. You may proceed with your question. ","Richard Repetto","Yes good evening guys.","Karl Roessner","Good morning, Richard.","Richard Repetto","I guess first question is for Karl or Mike would be on 38% pre-provision margin, it seems -- that seems conservative, it seems like you've taken out a lot of cost, you have the cost the $21 million that you already had taken out and you get lower SIFI cost now as well as well as synergies from the OptionsHouse, is there any -- can you give us a little more detail on walking because we have higher margins in that with these changes that you've given us here tonight in regards to SIFI and so forth?","Karl Roessner","Rich, if you back out the one-time items that we talked about in the remarks there, specifically the integration costs, which we project over the current year plus the build-out of SIFI costs in terms of both the one-time at around $10 million. And then the recurring building to about $15 million that's going to, that's going to drive that margin higher. So we are including them in that margin guidance, we did that largely for simplicity.","Richard Repetto","Okay. All right, I guess one follow-up or one another question would be, can you give us the pro forma DART growth you gave us, your sales are downsized accounts, assets, and trading. So just the pro forma DART growth 4Q over 3Q.","Karl Roessner","Okay. Q3 pro forma DART should be 173, Rich.","Richard Repetto","Okay, okay. And then very last question is, it looks like the sweep cash with the build-up of couple billion in sweep off balance sheet, sweep cash was that just a -- I'm just trying to see usually it felt like people are moving more into the markets and coming out as they did in the prior quarter.","Karl Roessner","Yes. So customers have been -- customers have been very tactical all year, the year opened with the market going down, we saw a lot of net buying off of that as the year went up, we saw degrees of selling a very tactical around the election, customers really buying and then really sort of taking gains off quickly on the market move.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. You may proceed with your question.","Devin Ryan","So obviously nice net new assets, the past two months $3 billion. To try and get a sense of if you can how much of that you thought was may be in election bump versus something you could actually point to that that you feel like you're doing and may be along the same lines, we're talking a lot about increasing kind of the active trader sales efforts. So maybe just a little bit more specifics around what you're doing there and then just, if we see that growth come through how we should think about the profitability of that. I'm assuming there will probably be some promotions with that as well.","Karl Roessner","Okay. Let me take the second part of the question first around active trader sales. The way we talked about and the way that we continue to look at it, we have a very solid active trader group right in a group of customers who are at the higher end of our book, who we provided very good services to and we're building out a team to really make sure that we're getting the best for them in everything that we do.","So more to come in terms of what we're directing at them in terms of platforms, in terms of the OptionsHouse integration, the options platform that we will go out, so that team is under construction, but that's a very important avenue for us and a very big part of our revenue. So Mike you want to go into this?","Michael Pizzi","Yes I mean, I mean specifically in the first part around the quarter, I would say that the election had a lot to do with some of the volumes and re-engagement of the retail customer. Obviously we've seen a pretty good sort of sector rotation in the market from various sectors that have been lagging prior in the indexes, customers engaged on that the higher volatility, the movements in the market all were great beneficial during the period.","I mean we've got a lot of things inflate around growth, I would like to say that some of that was some of what we immediately put in place, but I have to give credit to the market environment as really supporting the overall effect in the quarter.","Devin Ryan","Got it, that's great color. And then just with respect to the balance sheet growth, the $57 billion that's targeted by the middle of the year is that just an illustration kind of based on your estimate of capital build, just trying to think of your capital building faster and that's the best use of capital. Could you actually add a portion of that $5.5 billion of additional deposits faster?","Michael Pizzi","There is a number of considerations. We are -- we're taking money back from external third-party banks. We had a capital plan that we have -- that we are going to present with our regulators that we've been in dialogue up until this point. So yes, we could go faster of capital is available. But it is really an estimate based around capital building and capital availability to do this in the fairly thoughtful way over the course of the year.","Devin Ryan","Got it, okay. Just last quick one here. Second lending, how are you thinking about rates there and the outlook for that part of business?","Michael Pizzi","Like I say it's obviously a business with ebbs and flows with the degree of hard borrowers in the market and the degree of market activity. The fourth quarter had a bit of volatility to it but overall pretty healthy, pretty healthy levels and expecting really that to continue as the market environment continues throughout this year. Overall, I think the best way to think about that is about how it should scale overall with the size of the margin book. Bigger margin book should give us -- should scale directly into the more notable collateral.","The only thing, I would add to that is, if we see any significant change in the IPO market or any significant amount of hard to borrow is increasing in the market, then we should be able to do a little bit better out of that book.","Devin Ryan","Yes. But the NIM guidance essentially reflects kind of what has been that not some big change.","Michael Pizzi","I think Q4 is a pretty good overall run rate for right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Conor Fitzgerald with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Conor Fitzgerald","Good afternoon. Just want to talk on the operating margin target of 46% with the rate uplift, obviously quite a good deal better than June today. I just want to understand your confidence as being able to drive the better revenue to the bottom-line. And then just on technical aspect does the ones that are $144 million expense numbers are the $144 million number include the $70 million of expense synergies from OptionsHouse?","Karl Roessner","Yes. So just in terms of our confidence level to drop it to the bottom line. Mike's prepared remarks readout a statement in there about this impacting sort of all boats equally in terms of a rising tide.","So what we looked out there when we sort of look forward in a increasing rate environment there in all likelihood there will be competitive pressures around pricing around going after active traders and we will still be in the hand to hand combat that we are so fairly confident that we'll be able to drop quite a bit of it down, but we also know that we're going to be in quite a bit of pricing pressure and other changes in interest rates. Mike, you want to cover the last piece.","Michael Pizzi","Yes, look the slide really is a pro forma of long-term earnings power. So the expense base is directly taken from the operating margin target. So in that sense, yes it should include everything, but this is not guidance in for 2017 in terms of what the exact expenses should be running through. So I just want to clarify, when we talk about the synergy target but we're showing on sort of the long-term slide versus the evolution.","And then just to reiterate Karl's point, we do think the market will grow more competitive. There is an increase in both, in both columns on that chart about the amount of expenses there, but we have to respond to the competitive environment, we feel it's going to get more competitive, but we feel it's very competitive today. And so while there is an increase in the overall expense base to maintain that competition and get to those levels -- operating margin levels, the market can change and competition can increase beyond what we're expecting.","Conor Fitzgerald","That's helpful. And I will go to 46% NOI 2017 numbers just yet and then Karl just want to get an update on the interest level in M&A in the RA space. I know you touched on that in your prepared remarks, just want to hear how you were thinking through how you would consider acquisitions in that space just given the uncertainty around the deal. And then just given your comments about being focused on the returns to shareholders on my math, I think it's a 12% return on equity on the incremental balance sheet growth. So should shareholders expect that any M&A you pursue would have to have a return on invested capital above that level?","Karl Roessner","Well, there is a little bit of -- there is a little bit overall lift I think in the rate environment that's giving us a pretty good overall return in the current environment. So I think your math is on par, correct. It's going to be in the 12% range overall. And that's really the best use of capital. From a pure cost of equity standpoint; we are probably a little bit lower. So we're probably achieving a spread to that. But I think right now in the current environment, the best use of capital is to grow the balance sheet and that's what we're doing.","Michael Pizzi","Just to get to your point about appetite and sort of where we are, we are looking opportunistically in that space and it is the only logical way to get into this is through an acquisition. So if I had a look into my cards and sort of see where we were, it would make sense to go look at a platform that we could use to build. Right, we're not looking at a transformative transactions or big messy transaction, but rather one that would provide us additional sort of green shoots for growth, but the return that would have to be there, right, as we've shown. And as we'll continue to say to you all, we are stewards of our shareholders' capital, and our shareholders dollars and we will put it through the capital lens each and every time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question.","Christian Bolu","Good evening guys. Just on the growth prospects here, just putting aside inorganic opportunities, just bigger picture curious how you think about where the growth will come from. Are you expecting to expand the pie here, bringing new customers into the brokerage industry or is this a ploy for market share from the competitors?","Michael Pizzi","So Christian it's a bit of both, right. When you look at what we've done around OptionsHouse and bringing in those, capabilities and what we have been the number one rated options platform coming across, that's a new offering, when the package that with education, and the right active trader sales team and sales program that we're putting together now and we think that that will be a nice area of growth for us.","There is also some dislocation as everyone knows going on in the marketplace. So there are active traders out there who are interested in looking for and finding new homes and then getting better at the services we offer and trying to mine into our stock plan participant population that we have who early customers on us, we don't use us for anything else than executing their stock plan trades.","So there are a number of areas -- areas of focus, that we believe that we can get into quite quickly and quite a meaningful way that will help us drive this growth. So I think both of your points we are hitting very hard.","Christian Bolu","Okay, got it. And then just a question on liquidity management on the balance sheet. I guess if you put may be I guess $62.5 billion target just correct if I'm wrong, but it will mean effectively all your client cash will be on the balance sheet in securities with the duration around three to four years, I mean little bit of cash, but most have been securities to the extent we see a massive upturn in resale engagement and there is a significant move away from cash. Just help me understand how you manage liquidity just given the best I could tell that would be the more -- when its all the retail brokers you would have, I think the kind of most of your cash in fairly long-dated securities.","Michael Pizzi","Yes, I think the best way I think about that is, is the composition of the portfolio. The portfolio has a significant amount of really fairly short duration securities or floating rate securities in it. All of the securities in the portfolio at this point are agency backed with many of them being full facing credit guaranteed securities. They're incredibly liquid and allow us to reposition the balance sheet quite readily.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. You may proceed with your question.","Steven Chubak","Wanted to dig into Slide 21 for a moment. Looks like the majority of the balance sheet in business growth targets that are laid out here are actually within reach or within grasp at this point. And I'm just wondering whether you believe that most of these targets are actually achievable on within a reasonable timetable call it by 2018 and as the forward curve in fact materializes and we get for rate hikes are 100 basis points. I just want to gauge whether that 273, that's an aspirational target or if you think it's readily achievable within the next two years.","Michael Pizzi","I think the scenarios we are outlining on the slide are readily achievable. Getting back to one of the prior questions, you have to take out the investment items in the $50 billion regulatory build-out the integration cost but assuming we are -- we execute on all of that and deliver our growth targets, we should be able to achieve the economics that are shown in the slide.","Steven Chubak","Got it. And just switching over to the expense side, Mike, obviously very encouraging to see the progress that you guys have made and you laid out a lot of the different changes in terms of the guidance components that you laid out previously. I'm just wondering how we should be thinking about the jumping off point for expenses in 2017, after adjusting for all the new guidance or may be said differently, what expense base is actually contemplated in that 38% margin goal.","Michael Pizzi","I think we -- in terms of jumping-off point I think we gave clarity around sort of the early part of the year. Keep in mind, Q1 had certain spike and resets and other things that roll through the comp deadline. We are hiring people for the $50 billion initiative, there are some consulting spend going through that is going up a little bit early in terms of where the balance sheet's going to be so operating margin in the early part of the year is going to be a little bit pressure but probably in that mid-30s range but we are going to be exiting hopefully right around 40 so it's just about 40.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. You may proceed with your question.","Chris Harris","Thanks. Regarding OptionsHouse integration. I mean there is some pretty big things that happen in Q3. You talked about that one of those being clearing conversion are there no more synergies coming out until that occurs and then when those things occur we will get synergies kind of in the back half of 2017.","Karl Roessner","To this point, we've been very safely executing a lot of the expense synergies well on our way. But you're right, the amount of synergies coming out over the next period time the slow product until the conversion is complete. The conversion is really necessary to bring all of the revenue synergies online that's going to be cash portion, the investment of the cash as well as the margin economics then following that will be where there will be additional costs.","Chris Harris","Okay. But we're not providing any specific guidance around what the synergies might be for 2017, the dollar number.","Karl Roessner","No, not at this time. We're on track lower the synergies as we originally outlined.","Chris Harris","Got it. Okay and then just get clarity on one item. If we, do get another fed rate hike in 2017 or maybe actually even two how should we be thinking about the incremental margin from that?","Michael Pizzi","I think the additional rate hike should drive if it comes in mid-year, I think if you look at the fed funds futures curve. I think right now it's probably looking around June is sort of where it's priced it that would give us about 10 basis points of an expansion in the net interest margin for the full year. You can do the math what that means, around dollars. In terms of what that means for us is -- is where we are now in building out for growth. If there are opportunities to invest that additional and to continued growth or accelerate growth we're certainly going to take it if the returns are appropriate. It's not, we're going to have the discipline, let it roll through, I think that's the, that's the way I think you should think about if the opportunities are there. We'll make the investment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed with your question.","Brian Bedell","Great, thanks guys. Good evening. Just I would drill down again on the NIM for this year. Mike if you maybe talk about margin loan pricing if you expect to be able to get all of that for each fed hike and then your assumption of the yield curve that is baked in the NIM guidance and then also if you can talk about any kind of sweet deposit data when you would expect to be passing that through to customers.","Michael Pizzi","Yes, I think we are in terms of overall margin I think we did pretty good this quarter. You can see we are able to push through some of the margin from the rate hike and some of that just in terms of the mix composition of the book also helped us out this quarter as customers more at the higher, higher rack rates reengaged a bid. We will continue to price the margin book effectively with movements in fed funds, but we're well aware that much of the market is negotiated pricing and we continue to -- we will continue to negotiate against the competitive backdrop.","Looking at the cash side of the, of the balance sheet. We haven't really taken any actions yet. We're looking at the overall landscape of the competitive market where money fund rates are and looking to see when we will have to do it, but at this point we have not, we've not really taken any action into effect.","Brian Bedell","In the sensitivity to the statistics is I guess what yield curve assumption do you have and sort of any guidance?","Michael Pizzi","Yes. We gave the NIM guidance we gave assumes no additional Fed rate hikes. So the way we do that is we essentially if just were in the balance sheet according to our plan effectively reinvesting at the marginal reinvestment rate and not increasing the federal funds rate. If we get one increase in mid-year, you can add 10 basis points to that range.","Brian Bedell","As I meant on the longer part of the curve, if I would say we got another 50 basis point on the 10-year how would your sensitivity change.","Michael Pizzi","Yes, we are essentially allowing longer-term rates to evolve, according to the forward curve. So modeling some degree of upward drift if in that additional 10 basis points but in our base NIM guidance, we are holding rates constant.","Brian Bedell","Okay, that's good. And then just on the price competition I guess how you're thinking about, you with this -- with the industry consolidation going on, you're looking that as an opportunity to get customers from emerging entities and how aggressive, I guess, would you be on them. And with that change depending on -- on the environment obviously if the macro backdrop is more supportive for revenue growth, margins would you tend to get more aggressive on that for customer acquisition. ","Karl Roessner","Yes, we're actually pretty, pretty aggressive on customer acquisition now, it's one of the first things that we turned our focus to. As I said before, there is a lot of dislocation including the recently announced merger and there are a lot of folks who might be willing to look at new homes. So we're definitely focused on that and something we're driving. ","Brian Bedell","You rented up right now basically.","Karl Roessner","Yes, we have.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen with Buckingham. You may proceed with your question.","Chris Allen","Good afternoon guys. I was just curious, and I apologize if I missed this, the balance sheet guidance of $57 million I think it was mid-year, and I think $52 million the end of the year, how much does that assume is coming from the transfer of third-party deposits and how much is assumed from organic growth.","Michael Pizzi","Well, you look at the amount we have the $13.5 billion you have but we have enough third-party cash today to achieve those balance sheet targets. We're not really disclosing what our internal growth estimates are for cash for the year, but we have the capability really of delivering on the balance sheet forecast out of the$13.5 billion pool that's available today. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Carrier","May be just on the commission rate you guys mentioned, most of it just with OptionsHouse, just curious as you're bringing on clients I mean if there is some movement in the industry, like, do you see much pressure there, whether it's on margin or whether it's on your commissions. I know you guys mentioned longer-term as rates rise, you might see more competition. I think that's expected. But in this current environment, are you seeing much yet.","Karl Roessner","I mean we don't -- when we deal with customers and we sort of get into moving customer balances or talking to people finding a new home and coming to trade with us, it's almost always hand-to-hand combat. Right so there is pricing pressures around bringing folks in on negotiated pricing, folks who come in at on the rack rate pressure or others in the industry we haven't seen a lot of downward pressure on. But for the larger accounts, the active traders and the folks who really make a difference in terms of what they deliver for us and for our shareholders that there's absolutely pressure and that increases every day but the dislocation is driving a lot of that there's a lot of competition for that pool of individuals. There is definitely a finite pool of active traders out there.","Michael Carrier","Okay. And just as a follow-up you mentioned in the prepared remarks just a focus on like the marketing the strategy, shift versus maybe the past year. Just wanted to get a sense on where is the time or where is the money being spent and what are the expected returns or the goals if you look over the next 12, 24 months from that shift?","Karl Roessner","Yes, look -- we're looking and sort of devising the entire marketing plan right now. Right now, we're spending a lot of our time and efforts going after customers whether be true website, email campaigns or others developing an entire new approach to our brand that we hope to launch by the mid -- middle of 2017. So I'd expect a lot more on that.","In terms of the returns we're going to look at marketing to drive a significant amount of our customer and account acquisition and asset acquisition that we've talked about so looking at that to be quite a bit of it. We have increased our marketing spend in the numbers that we have but we will stay within our op margin on that spend.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Mewhirter with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. ","Doug Mewhirter","I had a question about the stock buyback or the potential stock buyback you talked about how you're going to be holding more capital in the bank this year but you're still going to be, you can do on the second, may be the second half of the year for the stock buyback. I would assume that you would -- you would buyback approximately when you could dividend up from the broker plus may be some surplus cash you already have; is that sort of the way to think about it? ","Karl Roessner","I would think about this way. We have the amount of capital and we're generating capital through earnings that's going to keep our Tier 1 leverage, allow us to grow the balance sheet, keep our Tier 1 leverage ratio at the binding constraint of 7. As we look at sort of that balance sheet evolution in a sort of thoughtful way over the course of the year as we get into the latter half of the year, we think we're going to have enough capital to return to buybacks.","Now the best use of capital to accelerate the balance sheet growth or we have more cash available that's going to leave us sort of with the high quality decision to make as to whether we want to get back to buybacks or whether we want to continue to pursue the balance sheet. But when we look at our capital plan today, when we look at how we're bringing money over, we look at the expectation of our forecast, we feel pretty good that we'll be able to return to buybacks in the back half of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Cyprys","Hi good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Just on the stock plan business, looks like the unexercised stock plan assets are down about two years in a row now $180 million down to about $103 million. So can you just talk a little bit about the competitive dynamics within the stock plan business, what sort of growth rate do you see for the industry and what your specific thoughts are in terms of what you do differently now in terms of gaining share?","Karl Roessner","Yes, I mean look the stock plan business is really the B2B component of it that you're talking about. There's a pretty long lead time on getting new clients over and converting them on to our system. I mean, pretty, pretty happy with our Equity Edge online platform that we have right it's an industry leader and we continue to add new clients but that business is extremely lumpy in terms of where the markets are, in terms of where the particular stock is, you get folks who get stock for the first time, it's in floated it's gone the next day they are marked up for a personal spending goal, for a car or house. So it gets a little lumpy and it's hard to sort of dig into where we are, what we think on that front. I'm very happy with the pipeline that we have out there right now. And I'm very happy with the team that that services that business.","Michael Cyprys","Any thoughts on M&A for that business?","Karl Roessner","Absolutely. One of the things that we're thinking about as I said a little bit earlier on the stock plan side looking both at scale, so lot of participants in that business really looking to get out or sort of looking to move around and we're quite happy with it because it's a natural extension and the natural feeder to our channels here.","So we like that, and also looking at other opportunities to deliver additional products on that line as well as it makes sense and anything even in that space will look through the capital alliance to see if it makes sense for our shareholders. But yes it's absolutely one of the areas we're looking at.","Michael Cyprys","Okay, great. Just as a quick follow-up here. Just on retirement, just curious how you plan to grow your retirement-related assets and how you think about prioritizing that versus the investments that they have going on with the active trader side of the business and then maybe you could just touch any sort of gaps you have on the retirement site today if any, how you want to close that?","Karl Roessner","Yes look to me; it goes hand in hand, right. We need active traders and we also need investors, as I said earlier, with us with E*TRADE, it's about perception. Right are we the home for people's longer-term money did they look to us as the company; they want to keep their dollars with. So big part of our marketing push and the marketing campaign be developing will be to generate additional awareness around that and also to take a good hard look at our offerings. I mean our adaptive is a very nice product. It's pretty seamless. It's got a nice customer interface but we really haven't marketed it, haven't gotten out there and we've been sort of languishing in the $1 billion to $3 billion range over the past seven or eight years in terms of assets under management or longer-term money. So it's really about perception and we intend to focus on it quite a bit. So it's both sides that we're investing in at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Kyle Voigt","Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on OptionsHouse, I'm just wondering now that you've had the acquisition close for a full quarter, can you just give an update on any attrition that you're seeing and I know it's still very early days, but also can you give an update on, if you have a better line of sight on the cross-selling and revenue synergy opportunities and the timing of how that will unfold? Thanks.","Karl Roessner","Sure. Look the acquisition went pretty smoothly, the integration is going similarly smoothly. Very happy with the team that we acquired, we love the capabilities they bring to the table and I love the energy that they bring to the table that definitely helped us move to a more sort of agile environment and gotten a lot more lean in our execution.","So that's been working very well. In terms of delivering the cross-sell and the products out to our customers, it's why the Q3 finish on both the conversion of the clearers and getting the tools up and running in terms of getting that over to E*TRADE is really important to us. So more to come in late third quarter and hopefully by our third quarter's earnings call, we'll be able to give you some more info on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Rutschow with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.","Rob Rutschow","I was wondering if you might be willing to share the level of payment for order flow revenues and what the impact of the OptionsHouse clearing conversion might mean for that and then longer-term, what if any impact moving from 30% to 35% derivatives might have on that revenue line item?","Karl Roessner","Order flow for the quarter was about $29 million overall. We don't really break out the full quarter effect of OptionsHouse on that number. But I think you're right that options have a bit of a higher overall payment and so improving option mix has a lot to do with it, but the real way to improving the option mix is just the regularity of the trading that goes on in the book, it really comes from the commission side, it's not really a desire around the order flow but the order flow is definitely part of economics there.","Rob Rutschow","Okay. And if I could just shift gears. Are there couple of key things that you're looking to do better in converting the stock plan clients into brokers or more importantly managed asset clients. So in other words, what are you looking to do better differently to get more of those clients to convert?","Karl Roessner","So one of the biggest thing is that we -- the challenge that we have on that front is showing stock plan participants that we're more than their stock plan provider as they use us, they look at us on the Corporate Services side as the folks who do the plumbing for their stock plan accounts. So getting in front of them earlier providing education seminars, dealing with the Corporate Client upfront when we execute the B2B agreement to make sure that we can get on and become a provider of choice for when those individuals having events in their stock plan and they have additional cash to invest, helping them understand that we have a robust, right that we're in the space that we do have the tools that they need, raising general awareness as I talked about before of our longer-term investing solutions.","So it's to me a lot of it is around that and then we also talk a little bit in the prepared remarks around some wealth management but that could be nice bolt-ons or partnerships that help you provide additional asset management tools or capabilities to our stock plan clients who have the resources and a lot of times trade off of us to go use dollars when we have the same tools and products available.","Operator","At this time, I will turn the call back to you, Mr. Roessner for any concluding remarks.","Karl Roessner","Thank you all for joining us on the call and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Have a nice evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the call for today.

Joining the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Karl Roessner; and Chief Financial Officer, Michael Pizzi.","Today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements, including statements about E*TRADE\u2019s future, operational, and financial performance and synergies related to the OptionsHouse acquisition, which reflect management\u2019s current estimates or beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.","During the call, the Company will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures.

All of these documents are also available at about.etrade.com.","Note that the Company has not reconciled its forward-looking non-GAAP measures, including non-GAAP adjusted operating margin, to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, because material items that impact that measure are out of the Company\u2019s control, and cannot be reasonably predicted.","This call will present information as of July 20, 2017. The Company disclaims any duty to update forward-looking statements made during the call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available via phone and webcast later this evening at about.etrade.com. No other recordings or copies of this call are authorized or may be relied upon.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Roessner.","Karl Roessner","Thank you, Ash. Good evening and thank you for joining. It\u2019s a pleasure to speak with you again, especially in the wake of such strong results and solid progress on our key initiatives. We have a lot to cover tonight, so I\u2019ll get right to it with a brief rundown of the Q2 highlights, all of which we will address in more detail. ","During the quarter, we marched forward on the integration of OptionsHouse, establishing many of the back and middle office connections which set the stage for the clearing conversion expected in early August. We rolled out a bold new marketing campaign beginning with our brand re-launch that returns us to our irreverent roots as a challenger brand. ","We delivered solid business growth with our best Q2 ever for asset growth and year-to-date account growth at the top of our target range. We recorded robust customer activity with record DARTs, a record mix of derivative trades, record customer net buying, and end of period customer margin balances that matched our previous record. ","We generated solid revenue growth in spite of absorbing a full period of reduced commissions. We grew our balance sheet as planned flexing the expanded earnings power that comes from more fully monetizing our customer deposits and we meaningfully reduced our allowance for loan losses to reflect the preponderance of positive performance data on loans that have converted to amortizing. ","And as if that\u2019s not enough, today we announced a reduction in our consolidated Tier-1 leverage threshold of 50 basis points, unlocking significant capital to be deployed to the benefit of our shareholders. Given our financial performance and the 50 basis point move, we are commencing a $1 billion share repurchase program which we expect to complete by the end of 2018, not too shabby for what are typically placid Q2 months. ","Now to spend a bit more time on each of these elements. On the integration, the team has exerted a tremendous effort to ensure a seamless conversion for customers, and I need to express my sincere gratitude for all the members of the integration team. ","Their tireless work into the twilight hours, including during the weekends and summer holidays, sacrificing personal and family time has truly gone above and beyond. With the each mock conversion, test and retest, they are delivering on our commitment to our customers and to our shareholders to harness and channel the full power of this acquisition. ","Over the next few weeks, all OptionsHouse customers will be brought into the E*TRADE ecosystem. This migration will expand their access to tools and services and simultaneously ensure the advanced derivatives tools and products to which they are accustomed remain just a click or tap away. ","From that point forward, we will build and further refine our offering, creating a unified and exceptional experience for all customers with a complete set of industry-leading tools and features. And now to highlight our most visible and exciting launch of the past quarter, our new brand campaign which rolled out in late June. ","Through it, we are making a conscious return to our challenger brand roots while speaking to our target customer segment in a far more relevant way. Our current executions are just the beginning and we have some serious firepower in flight as we add new work and optimize our creative mix and media spend. ","Our brand strategy taps into the everyday frustrations consumers feel when faced with constant depictions of exaggerated wealth and offer a positive way to channel that frustration into action. ","It\u2019s about optimism and the opportunity to own your own destiny, all executed with the tongue and cheek humor and irreverence consumers have come to expect from the E*TRADE brand. It\u2019s early days, but we are certainly pleased with the splash we\u2019ve made thus far and has heard great feedback from customers and prospects alike. ","Following the launch of the campaign, we have experienced a pronounced boost in key metrics relative to advertising awareness among our target market, prospect website visits, and most importantly new account growth. So bottom-line, we are getting our swagger back and effectively engaging our audience in a way that we haven\u2019t done in quite some time. ","I look forward to continuing to evolve the message delving more deeply into our value proposition and ensuring that E*TRADE is impossible to ignore. Since I took the helm in September, we have benefited from a strong market and elevated consumer confidence, but I certainly don\u2019t intend to shirk full responsibility for our successes. ","The enhancements we are making to the company are real and the impacts are tangible. Over the past three quarters, we have discussed executing on three core initiatives; the integration, our marketing, and improving the customer experience. While the first two are in their early stages, the third has been a pervasive element of every initiative, investment, and organizational structured decision. ","Our results are beginning to reflect these actions. First and foremost of the changes we\u2019ve made to our structure, which have positively resulted in improved productivity with clear accountability and strong cross-functional collaboration. We infused the organization with experienced, focused, and decisive leaders empowered to do what\u2019s right for our customers at every turn, which is foundational to achieving our growth goals.","We\u2019ve also put real focus into more fundamental elements of the employee experience like socializing a new mission, vision and values that unifies our culture of innovation, collaboration, and ownership and elevating talent development as a key business priority. Altogether, this has better aligned the employee base to our growth goals and focused everyone on the end customer.","A key drive in that regard has been addressing and eliminating our top customer dis-satisfiers. These range from the incremental in terms of tweaks to our account opening or fund transfer experience to larger scale efforts around improving efficiencies on our customer service process. All are based on active customer listening.","Key wins thus far include a better navigation experience on the website, an enhanced online application experience, and refinements to handful of our products and customer experiences. ","Like the steps we took to simplify our managed offerings this quarter, streamlining the customer risk tolerance questionnaire, reducing the minimum investment for robo, introducing a more competitive fee structure, and eliminating a handful of allocations that often proved misunderstood or misused by our customers. This is a small illustration, but we are focused on making continued enhancements across the product suite and all stages of the customer journey, and I look forward to sharing updates as we deliver them. ","As for our Q2 metrics, typically the second quarter proves challenging as tax season pressures net asset growth and the start of summer produces a lull in trading activity.","This quarter was clearly distinct, however, as we posted tremendous results across the board. DARTs ticked up from last quarter to 208,000 which is our best quarter on record adjusting for the exit of our international business in 2009 and our derivative mix improved to 32% of trades, our highest mark ever.","Customer margin balances ended the quarter up 12% at $8.2 billion tying our previous record. Net new brokerage assets of $2.6 billion represent our highest Q2 on record and brought our year-to-date growth rate to a healthy 4.9%, almost a 125 basis points higher than the same period last year.","Managed assets ended the quarter at $4.6 billion, an increase of 18% year-to-date, more than double the growth of the equity markets. We added 41,000 net new brokerage accounts in Q2 bringing us to 99,000 so far this year, which is nearly 60% higher than the same period last year and reflects a year-to-date growth rate of 5.7% at the top end of our target range. ","Attrition decreased slightly to 9% for the quarter, though was still elevated in light of the strong gross new activity last quarter including the typical flow through of less permanence as well as corporate services accounts. While this is an area of intense focus for the company, it is important to note that our customer attrition across our highest service tiers remains exceptionally low. ","In terms of July activity through yesterday, DARTs for the month were trending at around 200,000, down 7% month-over-month and customer margin balances had come in slightly to average around $8 billion. ","One element of our business that does not receive as much airtime during these calls, yet certainly garners significant attention internally is corporate services. We\u2019ve long discussed this channel as a strategically important driver of brokerage accounts and assets, as well as a steady source of cash proceeds which of course are a core component of our earnings power. ","I\u2019ve been very happy with the performance of this group and encouraged by the initiatives to bolster our offering. I am also particularly excited about the renewed focus on growing plan participants which is no small task. ","A few reasons I believe we can win more market share in this reinvigorated pursuit. First, we have the industry-leading platform. Our equity edge platform stands head and shoulders above the competition in terms of functionality, reporting, service, and overall experience and while we do receive external validation that tells us as much, the true proof is in the world-renowned client companies we earn and retain.","Second, our intentions are pure. For many industry players the prospects of offering private wealth management to a small handful of senior executives is the magnet that attracts them to this business. To those firms the broader employee base is an undesirable byproduct which often leads to subpar experiences for the vast majority of plan participants. ","Our offering on the other hand, is geared to serve all levels of the organization and it\u2019s particularly well suited for the broader employee population. Third, many of our competitors have recently chosen to shift to an outsourced software solution to service their clients. This for participant companies is tantamount to switching vendors entirely. ","As with any disruption in service, companies may be compelled to look around for something better and I very much like our chances in head-to-head contest with other providers. So we revel in this opportunity. To win in this emerging arena, a company needs the scale and self-directed simplicity that only comes from a digital first provider backed by exceptional service. This of course is our sweet spot.","And lastly, we have the right folks in the right place leading the charge several of whom actually joined E*TRADE from participant companies. So our understanding and appreciation of the challenges that face the industry are unparalleled. In all, E*TRADE Corporate Services shines bright throughout the stock plan space and is an increasingly important component of our path forward.","I very much look forward to sharing updates on our progress with this channel in the quarters to come. ","Before Mike takes you through our results and capital, I\u2019ll add a final note on the growth goals we set last September. We are moving ahead with great purpose and I remain ever more confident that we will nail our objectives on each measure. ","To quickly recap, those include, improving our growth rates on brokerage accounts and assets to at least 4.8% and 5.8% respectively, driving our mix of derivative trades to 35% and achieving $6 billion in managed product AUM.","These remain a central focus for the company and service the guiding metrics around which we structure our projects, our teams, and our efforts. That said, I want to reemphasize exactly what these objectives represents. We announced them to very transparently and publicly illustrate to investors that we can return to meaningful growth in our core business while holding a mirror up to our progress in this pursuit.","By this point, I hope it\u2019s becoming positively clear that our growth engine has indeed been reignited plus some editorial coverage of our strategy chooses to prominently feature scenarios with a company does not achieve its goals. The probability of any such outcome is fading further into the ether with each passing day. ","We have a great team defined by strong alignment, and our focus and resolve is unmatched. Our Board which includes me, is very pleased with our progress and I look forward to driving growth and value for our shareholders for many years to come. ","To sum it up, it was a tremendous quarter and first half of the year for E*TRADE. Important inroads were made and we are exactly where we need to be. The energy within our walls is electric. We are sharp, we are focused, we are executing and we will continue to deliver for our customers and for our shareholders. ","With that, I will turn it over to our CFO, Mike Pizzi.","Michael Pizzi","Thanks Karl. For the quarter we posted net income of $193 million or $0.70 per share which includes a provision benefit and other noteworthy items totaling $0.18 per share. The quarter was strengthened by net revenue generation of $577 million, clearly reflecting growth in the business and the balance sheet, the OH acquisition and the strong operating environment. ","We also maintained our prudent posture on expense management with an adjusted operating margin of 38%, which includes the unique expenses and excludes the provision benefit. ","Now to cover the unique items which benefited pretax income by $81 million. Most prominent was a $99 million benefit to provision for loan losses. Since we transitioned our loan portfolio to run-off in 2007, we have been discussing the potential risk event of interest-only loans converting to amortizing and the defaults that might arise from borrower payment shocks. ","The majority of our loans with this feature had a ten year draw and with the 2007 vintage widely recognizes the riskiest vintage, our sites were fixed on 2017 to ultimately observe the performance of these loans through the event. ","Our reserves assumed a significant worsening of performance post conversion and while there are many factors contemplated in our loss modeling, the most influential input is the actual performance of the loans themselves. ","At this point, the population of loans we previously deemed high risk has outperformed our expectations with a significant portion outperforming for more than 12 months post conversion. Accordingly, our loss expectations on the portfolio have improved meaningfully and the allowance has been reduced by almost half. At this point, we expect the allowance will decrease in future periods in line with charge-offs.","Next is the $9 million charge in communications expense for customer market data. This primarily relates to the fees charged by the exchanges for real-time market data for which they assign higher rates for users that meet their definition of professional. We have worked together additional customer data that helps to find this population and in Q2, we made significant progress in identifying the appropriate customer set.","As a result, we trued up our estimate recording a $9 million charge. Excluding this charge, the quarter\u2019s communication line should serve as a good runrate. ","And lastly, we realized $9 million of expense in the quarter, primarily related to the OptionsHouse integration and the work surrounding crossing $50 billion in assets. Recall that we initially outlined $22 million in one-time integration expense and $10 million in 2017 to build out for balance sheet growth. ","Year-to-date, we have incurred $12 million across both categories and we expect the additional $20 million will be realized over the remainder of the year evenly across Q3 and 4. ","Now on to our core results. Net revenues of $577 million was up $24 million from the prior quarter, reflecting balance sheet growth, and improved interest rates offset by the full quarter impact of our updated commission pricing. Year-over-year, revenues were up $103 million primarily on the same dynamics coupled with the addition of OptionsHouse. ","Net interest income increased 12% to $356 million during the quarter, as we grew average interest earning assets by$3.2 billion and net interest margin increased 11 basis points to 274 basis points. The increase was driven by the full quarter impact of the March Fed rate hike, higher customer margin balances, and strong securities lending activity attributable to a popular March IPO. ","Commission revenue of $105 million decreased 17% sequentially, driven by the full quarter impact of our pricing reductions. Commission per trade for the quarter was $8.02, which we believe should continue to be a good runrate. ","Fees and service charges increased $12 million quarter-over-quarter to $98 million. This was driven by higher order flow revenue related to a higher mix of options trades and higher asset-based fees on larger mutual fund balances, as well as the increased rate on off-balance sheet deposits. I\u2019ll cover more on this in a moment.","As a reminder, at the clearing conversion, we will capture all of the revenue synergies and the vast majority of remaining expense synergies associated with the OH acquisition. ","When we announced the acquisition nearly a year ago, we highlighted $16 million of annual revenue synergies predominantly derived from onboarding customer cash and margin balances with the subsequent increases in short-term rates coupled with the growth in the balance sheet, we now believe we will capture closer to $20 million of annual revenue synergies.","Non-interest expense for the quarter was $359 million, up $17 million sequentially, inclusive of $18 million in unique costs. Our 38% adjusted operating margin was up slightly from the prior quarter and above our expectations as a result of strong customer activity during the quarter. With respect to the full year adjusted operating margin, we previously noted that a June hike could add up to 100 basis points to our target of 38%. ","We are still at that belief and accordingly are increasing our 2017 operating margin target to 39%. You should expect the third quarter to be in line with Q2 before increasing in Q4 on balance sheet growth and a full quarter of realized synergies from OptionsHouse. Note that this assumes our current plans for investment spending, as well as all unique charges. ","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 39% which is in line with our expectations for the next two quarters. As for net interest margin sensitivity of rates, in Q2, we benefited from the full quarter impact of the Fed\u2019s March rate hike and modestly from the June hike. ","And while the long end of the curve didn\u2019t show resiliency until quarter end, we did maintain an average reinvestment rate on the securities in the 230 to 250 basis point range. This, aided by an improved rate on customer margin with strong growth in that product raises our expectations for full year 2017 NIM to the low 270s. This expectation assumes no changes in the rate environment and that margin balances are held constant. ","During the quarter, the yield on third-party customer cash averaged 92 basis points, up from 58 basis points in Q1 incorporating the benefit of the June Fed hike. ","Our expectation for the remainder of the year barring any further rate hikes is for those deposits to yield approximately 120 basis points noting the volume should continue to reduce as we onboard deposits to grow the balance sheet. Third-party cash will reprice roughly in line with short-term market rates with around a three months lag to receive the full benefit of the move. ","On the capital front, we have several forces acting in our favor this period strong earnings, the significant reduction in our allowance and the lowering of our consolidated Tier-1 leverage threshold together driving an outsized formation of capital. ","This has enabled us to launch a larger buyback program while maintaining balance sheet growth at our planned pace. We believe the move to 6.5% reflects a more appropriate leverage threshold in consideration of our overall strategy, asset composition and risk profile. It recognizes our continued strong financial performance, as well as ongoing dialogue with our regulators. ","Following the change, we now have approximately $520 million of excess parent capital pro forma for Q2 levels. That in conjunction with our strong financial performance has enabled us to institute a meaningful share repurchase program with plans to complete $1 billion in buybacks by the end of 2018. We will proceed at a measured pace over the course of the program. ","As for balance sheet growth, we are on track to end the year with $63 billion in total assets, even in the wake of Q2\u2019s record customer net buying. I will note however that the factors making onboarding deposits the most compelling use of capital can shift with interest rates and the shape of the curve.","The rate on off-balance sheet sweep toggles more closely with Fed funds while our incremental yield on securities is more closely tied to the belly of the curve. If the economics flip, we will change course, but at this point, we plan to hit our balance sheet growth targets. ","One last point on capital and parent liquidity. During Q2, we distributed $50 million of capital to the parent from the broker\/dealer. In Q3, we anticipate distributing $100 million. Also worth noting, earlier this week, our corporate debt rating was upgraded to BBB by Standard & Poor\u2019s citing our continued reduction in legacy risks and our growth of stable revenues. ","I believe we have additional upside potential on our ratings over the medium term driven by all we are doing to improve the business, our earnings and our continued efforts in risk management. ","In closing, it was an awesome quarter. We completed significant work on the OptionsHouse integration. We generated strong business growth and we grew revenue in solid fashion shrugging off the impact of the commission reductions, we progressed well on our balance sheet growth and we crystallized the next leg of capital deployment bolstered by a reduction of our leverage threshold.","All are positively value generative for shareholders and all tie back to Karl\u2019s points about renewed energy within our walls. ","And with that, we\u2019ll open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. ","Rich Repetto ","Yes, good evening, Karl. Good evening, Mike. I guess, the first question is the substantial buyback and I see the $520 million or freed up capital, I guess, if you could walk through how you came up with the $1 billion and how you came up with that number, I guess, starting with \u2013 I guess, the $520 million because of the lower leverage ratio?","Michael Pizzi ","Well, the $520 million of excess is pro forma for where we ended this quarter at 7.5 down to the level of 6.5. Inclusive in that is the $100 million of reserve release, so that gives you sort of the starting formation of capital. ","The remainder of that amount is really, as we look at our capital plan over the next sort of horizon cycle in terms of looking at the out years, specifically the next budget year through the year end 2018, we look at the capital generation in corporate cash and corporate liquidity available to fund the buyback program and that gave us a rough idea in terms of how we wanted to size it overall. Looking at that, we feel $1 billion is a good number that we can complete at a measured pace over that time period. ","Rich Repetto ","Got it. Okay. And then, I\u2019ll just do one follow-up. That\u2019 be on the \u2013 I guess, Karl, on the revenue synergies from OptionsHouse, you\u2019ve up the revenue synergies and I am just trying to understand with the price reductions how would up the revenue synergies, I guess, is it all from Fed rate hikes and on the net interest side or how you came up going from a 16 and higher, I guess?","Karl Roessner","The largest revenue synergy from the OH deal, as we talked about, is really related to the cash balance that comes from the OH customers being fully deployed within our model. That amount is now better simply because we are in a better rate environment overall and can earn a higher rate of return on that cash, that\u2019s the primary driver in the increase in the revenue synergies. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Conor Fitzgerald with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. ","Conor Fitzgerald ","Good evening and thanks for the feedback you are seeing on the new advertising campaign. I was just wondering if there is a way for you to quantify how much of an impact do you think the new campaign could have in your account growth. ","And then just a question on your targeted demographics with the new campaign, it seems like you are targeting customers who want to invest on their own ideas versus some of your previous campaigns that are more geared towards customer retirements. Is that a fair read? I am just curious what demographics you are going after.","Karl Roessner","So, on the first point, Conor, on the first points, it\u2019s really looking at rolling out the ad campaign is sort of early days, right it was end of June when we took it out. And what we\u2019ve seen so far is, a good reception and nice increase voice, share of awareness, and then some new account builds and also just driving more eyes to our website on the prospects side and more interest overall on E*TRADE. ","So the first part of that rollout was really about branding, and it starts to get to the second part of your question, this is going to be a staged rollout. First one is getting us back on the map by sharing the irreverent voice that we have letting customers know that not only we are still in the game, but we are here to help them with their finances at every stage along their life. ","So it\u2019s not a target to demographic we are looking at. You will see more of the campaign rollout over time as it starts to shift, so it\u2019s definitely not a shift from a starting investor versus retirement versus some of the other tools or products and services that we offer. ","You will see more around our functionality and more around the products and services and our value prop in particular out into the fall and thereafter. So this is just a very beginning of the campaign and it\u2019s really just on brand Conor. ","Conor Fitzgerald ","And that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then just on expenses, I think excluding the one-time communications expense and the integration charges, your pretax margin was 41% this quarter. Just given some of the revenue tailwinds you have from the larger balance sheet in the June hike, should we think about your core pretax margin as growing from that 41% ex any integration charges?","Michael Pizzi ","Well, as we outlined, we gave the guidance, it\u2019s 39% including the $20 million of remaining charges which we expect to occur pretty much evenly over Q3 and Q4. Keep in mind, there is some variability in timing of some of the $50 billion work we are moving at pace and making great progress. But sometimes things take a little bit longer, but we are doing well and moving through it. Yes, the environment is good. You can see that really within the margin balances within the net interest margin and other factors, and so we will have more to say about what the 2018 operating margin guidance will be at a later call.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. ","Devin Ryan ","Okay, thanks. Good afternoon guys. Maybe first one if you are just on the record level of net investor buying in the quarter. How does that make you think about the client cash management and your duration profile? ","Obviously, the firm still has flexibility with off-balance sheet sweep, but as that diminishes you just move more to on balance sheet, do you think about maybe holding more floating rate or has that just naturally shortened the duration of the overall balance sheet because you want to kind of keep more liquid?","Karl Roessner","Well, look at our deposit flows quantitatively. We break down a volatile balance away from core balances. That volatile balance is invested in floating-rate-type securities or very short duration securities overall. So we factor that in, in terms of the overall volatility in the product and the estimation of the product duration. ","From a liquidity standpoint, I would say that the very high level of liquidity to balance sheet really holding the preponderance of government and agency obligations that we do, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be changing really our mix or approach to it at this point.","Devin Ryan ","Got it. Okay. And then a follow-up here just the retail brokerage industry I am seeing some pretty good asset flows over the past several quarters I think as a whole. When you look at your net new assets, and kind of break them down is it or can you give us any sense of how much is new customers that are kind of new to the market or how much is transfers of accounts and within the TOAs, is that coming from kind of direct competitors in this kind of brokerage base or is from wirehouses or just where are you seeing the flows from?","Karl Roessner","So it\u2019s interesting. When I look at what the commission cuts did and the price cuts did couple of months ago and then coming into this, it really tangibly show that a lot of money in motion it got people to really think about their finances again and sort of check in and look at what they have and where they are. So there is a lot of money in motion. ","I think we\u2019ve gotten our fair share across the board. So I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s from any particular source we are seeing both new money come in, we are seeing money from wirehouses, we are seeing money from competitors. It does remain extremely competitive out in the marketplace. ","But I do think this caused a reengagement along the retail brokerage side and that coupled with what\u2019s gone in the marketplace and just how strong the markets have been. We are absolutely seeing a lot of money in motion, but there is nothing I can provide finger on to say, 60%, 70% 80% from this one source that\u2019s really across the board. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak - Nomura Instinet. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. ","Steven Chubak ","Hi, good evening. ","Karl Roessner","Hi, Chuk. ","Steven Chubak ","Karl, I really appreciate the helpful commentary you provided on the corporate stock plan business. Some of the competitive dynamics in this space. Recently, one of your large wirehouse competitors which predominantly serves the high net worth clientele within the corporate stock plan business actually outlined in your initiative in an effort to take market share and really cash provider in that by moving down market. ","And just seeing as this is an area where you continue to have a leading presence. Some of you could speak about the competitive dynamics in this space today and maybe how you are positioning the firm to build a little bit of a mug to ensure, you protect your market share against any new entrants?","Karl Roessner","So, it\u2019s a great question and thank you and the time is absolutely appropriate. So, one thing I don\u2019t look at it as \u2013 around what we have, I am actually quite proud of the product that we have in equity edges is the leading platform out there. ","So when you look at stock plan and you look at the way that it\u2019s been run historically, I am quite proud of what we did when we came in and sort of realigned the leadership and ownership of that business to make sure that the stock plan business itself was focused on just that, right. ","Getting out there and serving and winning new big ticket customers in the client base and new big ticket corporations and companies, whether they\u2019d be public companies or those about to go public, right, with their stock plans and make sure we are serving that client base with our number one sort of leading platform. ","So that\u2019s the first piece. In that space, I am extremely confident in our ability to compete and when you talk about sort of going folks out and work with saying they are going to go down market, now the question shows is what that is, in the prepared remarks, I talked a little bit about serving the entire broad based employee population. ","I think our product does that very well. So competing head-to-head it is \u2013 I am very, very happy with our chances there. And when you look at what they talk about in terms of some of our competitors are going to this outsourced technology solution, it\u2019s a great product, but that\u2019s a change for the client, right it\u2019s a change for the corporation. ","So many of those are going to be put up a bid and in that situation I like our chances very much. So yes, it\u2019s very competitive. But we are one of the leaders in the space. We continue to invest in the platform and it\u2019s a broad based platform. So we don\u2019t need to go down market. We serve the whole market. We are happy to take all comers to our platform. ","The second side of that is really in the realignment was making sure when you talk about the plan participants where we have about 1.5 million plan participants on us who are potential E*TRADE customers making sure that those are focused on by our E*TRADE securities reps and make sure that we are in there. They know what services we can provide. ","They understand that we can offer them help in their financial well-being. It fits another part of what we are focused on. So, I like the competitive environment in this space. I like our leadership position in this space. And I\u2019d promise you I am not building a move around that. ","Steven Chubak ","Thanks for the helpful color on that Karl. And switching gears to capital management side, Mike, you gave some helpful detail in response to an earlier question around what prompted you to decide on the $1 billion as the appropriate size for the buyback. ","I am just thinking about all the capital management priorities that you\u2019ve outlined in the past. Why not take the \u2013 since it\u2019s $500 million of excess you have today, why not initiate a dividend in lieu of a buyback? And maybe thinking about other potential alternatives, how should we interpret this recent announcement in the context of the strategic M&A priorities that you\u2019ve outlined in the past?","Michael Pizzi ","Sure, I\u2019ll just answer the question on a possible dividend first and Karl can cover where we are on M&A priorities. In the release of capital or the reduction in capital requirement, it\u2019s a one-time item. It\u2019s not really a core basis to form a dividend around. And you see also the release coming out of the allowance as well, also really being one-time. ","We think a dividend needs to really be built around sort of the core earnings and growth over time from that earnings stream. Now we are combining both of those when we do this, so they are \u2013 I guess, you could have introduced a small dividend, but our decision really in looking at it from a capital generation standpoint is a good portion of this is related to actions that we are taking within the capital plan, we felt that the right pathing here was to doing this by a buyback and really look at that over our \u2013 over the next year. So beginning now through the end of 2018.","Karl Roessner","And on the acquisition front, we have talked about the areas that we would think about going into and starting again with the overlay that we are just not interested in the market for a transformative transaction right now. So we will be looking for additional products or additional services that we might be able to bolt-on, what other functionality or technology we might be able to bolt-on through our offering. ","These are leap frogs, catch up or get into a new space in that respect, but it\u2019s an interesting market right now in terms of valuations and what else is available out there and we\u2019ve been very good stewards of our capital. We don\u2019t intend to change that decision right now. ","This is far and away the best use of our capital is to return it to shareholders and continue to grow our balance sheet. In terms of the areas that we would look at and if there was something compelling, we would still consider and that\u2019s really in the stock plan space. Right, is there a way to get additional scale to bolt-on additional corporate and grow that area, is there something out there, but right now there is not a lot on the horizon and this is the best use of capital and we will continue to look at things that way. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. ","Chris Harris ","So, credit quality continues to surpass your expectations. I would think that your prospects of potentially getting capital release at the bank have now improved. So you guys talk a little bit about how we should be thinking about that opportunity? ","Michael Pizzi ","Right now the minimum at the bank is 7.5. The minimum at the parent is 6.5. That\u2019s our operating mandate for the time being and really the binding constrain really go forward on the buyback program really becomes the overall level of corporate liquidity. In the past, we\u2019ve talked about two times debt service. ","We should think of that as really a minimum in the overall level really with what we need from an operation standpoint, what we feel good from a risk management standpoint running the company. It\u2019s probably about twice that level and that\u2019s really what\u2019s going to form our expectation of pacing going forward. ","From a move into the bank capital level, the bank capital level is at 7.5 today and we are holding it there on our planning process. But I will say that the balance sheet is improving continually if the portfolio runs down there is less risk and the reinvestment is defined as agency securities only at this point. So, there \u2013 we are optimistic of the possible opportunity, but for right now, the level is 7.5.","Chris Harris ","All right, sounds good and a quick one on expenses. Is there much in a way of expenses that are still tied to the loan book at this point? And if so, can you guys quantify that for us?","Michael Pizzi ","The expenses with the loan book are what you can imagine, it\u2019s the number of headcount that we need across the areas in terms of the administration and operations of the book. So essentially service our oversight workouts, loan modification review, compliance around the operation of the loan portfolio as well as the modeling of the allowance process and stress testing. ","We haven\u2019t really broken those expenses out at a direct way. From an overall expense base they are not going to be incredibly meaningful, but from a cost basis around the size of the loan portfolio, in terms of the revenue to loan portfolio is putting off they are quite meaningful in the overall sort of when it create a \u2013 segments in loan P&L. ","And so, that\u2019s how we think about it. They don\u2019t scale very well with the portfolio although they do scale it some degree, but we do think at this point, holding the portfolio for the foreseeable future is still in the best interest of our shareholders. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. ","Michael Carrier ","Thanks guys. Just a question on the balance sheet. On the off-balance sheet cash are there any limits in terms of where you can bring on and then Mike, you just touched it in terms of the rate backdrop, different scenarios can shift the priority and what you want to do with the capital? ","So just any color on that and then it sounds like from the initiatives that you guys have in place, the focus on growing the balance sheet after the transfers is on the core brokerage business and if clients have 10% to 20% in cash, then that will continue to grow. Is anything that\u2019s more focus direct on cash balances from like a \u2013 from a growth initiative?","Michael Pizzi ","Yes, from what we can bring on the balance sheet, we are targeting 63 for year end. We\u2019ve got \u2013 off to get to 63 in terms of what\u2019s off-balance sheet, so we don\u2019t really need to see organic growth to get to that level. In addition, we are probably left with a round of $1 billion of additional deposits we can onboard into next year beyond the 63 target for this year. ","And that would use up what really could realistically be brought on. The rest would need to remain off-balance sheet for FDIC insurance purposes. So that\u2019s essentially larger cash balances in the remaining portion of the balance. It is a best way to think about cash growth from that point going forward is it\u2019s going to scale overall with account growth. ","The average balance of cash per account in that sort of 15% to 20% range depending on sort of customer risk appetites. It\u2019s going to scale really as accounts grow with some additional cash really coming from the corporate services business as corporate service executions work through over time and you typically will see that during Q1. ","Michael Carrier ","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. ","Dan Fannon ","Thanks. I guess, I want to talk about activity levels and how you are thinking about that once you fully integrate the platforms and you are getting the full suite of products and technologies across OptionsHouse and the E*TRADE customers? And then also, I think in your previous comments, that\u2019s not included in potential revenue synergies, that was the $20 million or so that you highlighted?","Michael Pizzi ","Yes, the revenue synergies we gave, the vast majority of them are coming from the OH\u2019s cash. The second pool is really just coming from taking the clearing in-house and monetizing the full value of the margin that comes \u2013 that is essentially being split with the third-party pre-integration.","Karl Roessner","Yes, and in terms of activity and what we expect post-integration, it\u2019s one of the reasons that when I talk about this and I talk about sort of the excitement that we have around here is, we haven\u2019t fully integrated yet. ","We haven\u2019t gotten the fantastic tools and technology that OptionsHouse brought to the table out to our E*TRADE customer base. So, we absolutely look at that as a very big part of us going forward which is why I am so pleased with where we are today on growth goals. ","Dan Fannon ","Great, and then just the follow-up on the fees and services charges. Mike, you mentioned some moving parts in terms of the increase this quarter and then just thinking about going into next quarter and thereafter with the higher rates and from the June hike, should we see all of equal that number continue to rise based on the money market yields of the off-balance sheet cash that\u2019s coming through there?","Michael Pizzi ","Well, yes, to the extent we outlined the rate for you in the prepared remarks, so, we expect about 120 basis points or so on the off-balance sheet. So it\u2019s going to go up from the 90 that we are at this quarter, but the balance is coming down as we onboard cash. So when we look at the total fees and service charges line for this quarter, the increase is across a lot of \u2013 a couple of different categories. ","One is the increase in rate on a declining balance. The rate effect in the quarter is bigger than the balance effect and so we get a benefit this period because of the two rate hikes that occurred. The other elements driving it are really within the order flow line are increase in options in the quarter led us to have better overall payment for order flows from options because we get more on an option contract than \u2013 an option order than we do on equity order. ","There is two top combined with some of the asset-based fees that we are earning which were also up contributed to the improvement in fees and service charges on the quarter. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. ","Brian Bedell ","Okay, thanks very much. So just, maybe back on the buyback, maybe if you can just talk about whether you plan to be more opportunistic or more sort of regular through the quarters and if your stock price goes up significantly, would you pair that back and look at other alternative uses of capital such as if you see if you want to be opportunistic on small sized M&A. And when can you actually get back in the market after earnings here?","Michael Pizzi ","Yes, so, look, I think we\u2019ve shown in the last program that we can be a little bit tactical to the extent we have corporate liquidity and excess capital to work with, we can be tactical around the execution. That said, we don\u2019t authorize large buyback programs with a view of just leaving them out there. We intend to return capital and so I would expect us to get started. ","But within those confines we can be tactical as we have been in the past around possible share price movements. In terms of upside, I think it would depend on the conditions of the time under what should happen in terms of where that price is we don\u2019t really have a target at which we would stop at this point. But I mean, I think we would consider it in the environment we are in and the relative alternative capital opportunities that we would have.","Brian Bedell ","Okay, great. And then, maybe a question for Karl, obviously you are proceeding well towards the growth goals, it\u2019s still early days of course. Assuming that you do hit them and can sustain them. If you can improve the PE, I guess, in terms of what investors are willing to pay for the earnings growth, how do you think about or how I can tell, how do you in the forward think about staying independent versus other strategic alternatives such as a sale?","Karl Roessner","Yes, so, it\u2019s a good question that\u2019s one I face quite often. So, what I would say is, as a management team here, right, and so this is for the management team here we are focused on continuing to drive value in the business every day, right, you guys see the changes that we are making. ","You see some of the impacts they are having, yes, we have some tailwinds behind us, but I think we\u2019ve done quite a nice job in terms of bringing this price along and really reigniting the growth engine that we have. ","As a Board, we know what our duties are and we will continue to evaluate those, right. This is a very well informed Board. We go through an exercise. Once a year where we look at the intrinsic value, we have third-parties come in and talk to the Board and educate them to make sure that the Board understands what the starting point is for any discussion should those even happen, right as the CEO, I can tell you, I fully expect to hit the growth goals and I fully expect to be independent and come out of this with flying colors. ","Those growth goals are not the end game of this organization. They are not a targeted state. They are merely to show that we can continue to grow the franchise and drive growth in it. So that\u2019s really the process I go through with those three hats on and I am quite proud of what the organization has done so far. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brendon Hawking with UBS. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. ","Brendon Hawking ","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question guys. First one from me on the deposit beta, nice to see that\u2019s sustaining at a markably low level. How should we think about the competitive environment? And any potential upward pressure on that rate on a go forward basis?","Karl Roessner","We absolutely continue to keep an eye on the competitive environment and sort of what\u2019s out there. You may see some pressure at the higher end of the book for customers who have extremely large cash balances who look it from that respect. Right now, we are quite pleased with where we are and we will continue to evaluate that as the market evolves. ","Brendon Hawking ","Okay. Does the \u2013 but circling back to one of the points you made earlier, I think you made reference of the idea that certain balances above FDIC thresholds are \u2013 remain, a portion remains off-balance sheet. Does that help maybe insulate some of that upward pressure on the high balance accounts?","Michael Pizzi ","Yes, I mean, within our two bank charters we can hold the first 500K essentially of a customer\u2019s balance. After that, it\u2019s going to get pushed out to third-party banks for FDIC insurance purposes. So, we have multiple different pricing tiers and so we can apply different betas. When we talk about deposit beta, it\u2019s not one number, we can apply it across different pricing tiers. So that essentially the larger cash balance customers we can pay higher rates through, if they are going to hold that cash for a longer period of time. ","Frequently, what you see with the large cash balances customers is they sort of ebb and flow as they go in and out of the market. And so, from an overall sensitivity, they are more sensitive though than small cash balance customers, but not meaningfully so in a way that they are trading in and out of the market. I will say at this point, we\u2019ve outperformed our estimates. ","If you would have gone back before any Fed moves, we would have had moves by now in terms of overall beta. But we are watching very closely to the competitive environment looking at what our customers are expecting. What they are sensitive to and we will move accordingly when we feel that the time is necessary. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. ","Kyle Voigt ","Hi, good evening. Just one question to some of the futures offering. I think you said in the past that futures trades about 2% of total DARTs and you also noted that you plan rolling out an integrated futures platform after the OptionsHouse integration. ","Just now are they are getting closer that in August. I am just wondering if you can give some more color on the offering. Have you had plans for the rollout already? And then, maybe we think the opportunities in terms of where futures can get to as a percentage of total DARTs? Thanks.","Karl Roessner","And thank you for that, because it sort of helps clarify a little bit of what we\u2019ve talked about with the integration. So, in early August, we intend to complete the move of the OptionsHouse customers into the E*TRADE ecosystem which basically means, plugging them in their functionality and their customers into our back and middle office on that offering. ","So at that point in time, we will have been in our ecosystem, we will have our tools available to them. We will have some other functionality available, but going forward, it will really be a platform that we will be very thoughtful about rolling out, right. We have many different platforms right now. We have customers who like those, who have ways that they like to trade, ways that they are set up on their own E*TRADE accounts and the way they have traded for years. ","You don\u2019t want to just sort of unplug them and plug them into a new environment and offer them something that they really aren\u2019t interested in. So we are being very careful and thoughtful about rolling out the best for all of our customers. As part of that will be a fully integrated futures offering. Right now, you\u2019re right, we are at about 2% of DARTs on futures. ","I see the opportunity there when you look at what some of our competitor set does, I mean, just to be quite frank and blunt, our futures offering \u2013 I love the fact that we have 2% coming through, because it\u2019s something easy to use, right, the way that it\u2019s set up now. So when you fully integrate it, I think there are opportunities \u2013 we\u2019d like to grow it to 10% of our overall DARTs. ","I think that\u2019s where we should be on a normalized basis, when we have a fully integrated seamless offering that our customers find easy to use and that\u2019s sort of where we are headed. But that\u2019s a little bit longer term. It\u2019s probably couple months down the road in terms of thinking about the platform, rolling it out and getting that done the right way for our customers. ","Kyle Voigt ","Great. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen with Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. ","Chris Allen","Evening guys. Just a quick one and I apologize if I missed this. Where do the OptionsHouse expense synergies currently stand? Is it still roughly 50% of the $49 million? And is the remainder going to be triggered with the conversion, what you think it is?","Michael Pizzi ","Yes, in the prepared remarks, we talked a little bit about it. Post conversion, we will have reached virtually all of the expense synergies. There is some small ones that will go on over the remaining quarters. So, but you will get all of the revenue synergies and most all of the expense synergies really about time we are ramping up Q3. ","Chris Allen","And the expense synergies are currently about half way or?","Michael Pizzi ","That the $49 million is the right total and we haven\u2019t updated exactly where we are, but most of the remaining ones are tied to integration.","Chris Allen","Great, thanks guys. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Mewhirter with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. ","Doug Mewhirter ","Hi, good evening. First question on the \u2013 your loan portfolio, you talked about the 2007 vintage, and how it\u2019s forming a lot better than expected post conversion from interest only. What\u2019s the tale on that portfolio? ","So I imagine that part of that outperformance could be sort of economically related, how much time do you have before \u2013 you actually don\u2019t even have to worry about the economy because most of those loans are going to be paid off anyway. Is it \u2013 are you sort of holding your breath for three more years, five more years, ten more years on\u2026","Karl Roessner","Well, contractually, there is different amortization periods that they move into, but the bulk I believe are in 20 year amortizations. But that\u2019s not really necessarily the most relevant is the prepayment rate. They are prepaying in the sort of almost 20% type range. That\u2019s going to give you on a 20 year amortizing loan really, probably weighted average if I would guess right around three to four years or so in that range. ","So, I think the important aspect is, even if they are economically sensitive, the amortization really begins to build collateral value \u2013 not collateral value, but begins to pay down the collateral value in the loan improving the overall LTV. So, at this point, as the portfolio seasons, it will naturally improve in credit quality. ","Doug Mewhirter ","Okay, thanks. Just one last very quick question. On your operating margin guidance, you had mentioned 100 basis points little higher than you thought. That was for 2017, is that\u2019s correct?","Karl Roessner","That\u2019s correct. Yes.","Doug Mewhirter ","Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s all my questions.","Karl Roessner","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. ","Mike Cyprys ","Hi, good evening and thanks for taking the question. Just curious on the adaptive portfolio, the robo advisor that you have, if you could update us on the progress there and what sort of feedback from customers, latest thoughts on the marketing campaign, I think you are planning to relaunch the marketing campaign for that at some point and how much in assets do you have and how you are thinking about the opportunities out there?","Karl Roessner","Yes, I mean, look on the \u2013 so, robo, I talked about this, I\u2019ve talked about it quite often in terms of the robo that we will now list on adaptive portfolio. I think it\u2019s a very nice tool and I think it works quite well. It has a about 400 plus million in it right now. I think to be in this space and to provide the right set of tools to your customers is extremely important. ","So I think when we look at the robo, we also need to think about just a more simplified robo offering that\u2019s easy to use for our customers and I think you will see a more integrated sort of easy to use offering rolling out over the next few months. So adaptive has its place, but it\u2019s also be a nice thing to have that sort of simplified offering that we will roll out for our customers. ","So I would look for a marketing campaign more around the tools and functionality as we go forward, as we get sort of more into the value proposition from the entry level in new customer, all the way through to the seasoned sort of derivatives trader. ","Mike Cyprys ","Okay, thanks. And then just so about the dividend, you mentioned that your dividend is getting to have to be built around core earnings and growth over time. So just curious how you are thinking about E*TRADE\u2019s core earnings today and your ability to grow that over time? And why not pay out a dividend from that core earnings stream today? ","Karl Roessner","Yes, I mean, we looked at the capital plan in terms of the generation of capital up to the parent that we can move from city areas over the course of the year. And then really this one-time \u2013 the one-time benefit of the move in ratios, plus the reserve release that occurred in the quarter. And we felt that we are still relatively tactical around the capital planning process that we want to be flexible in our capital priority is much like you saw in the OH acquisition. ","We were in mid of a program that was authorized to the $800 million level and completed roughly $500 million when we switched to deploy some of that cash in the acquisition of OH. I think that that\u2019s a good example of tactical flexibility in the program. That\u2019s not to say we would look to dividends in the future. I just think in this phase in our evolution the buyback program is what makes the most sense. ","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. ","Patrick O'Shaughnessy ","Hey, so, net new asset growth is arguably your most ambitious goal. What\u2019s your confidence level in achieving 5.8% to 6.8% net new asset growth which my math implies from going - from about $10 billion of net new assets in 2016 to probably closer to $18 billion or so in 2018?","Karl Roessner","Yes, Patrick, it\u2019s something that I am still extremely confident in, right. We laid them out as realistic goal and that growth will come from the complete integration of the OptionsHouse platform growing our customer base, it will come from our corporate services channel and the asset and account growth that we get through that channel. So I am still extremely confident in the numbers that we put out there.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy ","Great. And then maybe a follow-up for Mike. Can you quantify how much order flow revenue increased quarter-over-quarter? And probably more importantly, how much upside is there to that revenue line when you kind of achieved your long-term derivatives as a percentage of trading goal?","Michael Pizzi ","Order flow revenue was up $4 million overall versus the $11 million gain at fees and service charges. In terms of what the long run is, we are about \u2013 we ended it about 32% overall for option starts. Our goal in the intermediate term is 35%. That\u2019s really what\u2019s driving that. So you can scale up the increase in payment if we are successful there in terms of the overall proportion of DARTs in driving that additional value from the fees and service charges line. ","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to our presenters.","Karl Roessner","Thank you all for joining and have a great evening.

No other recordings or copies of this call are authorized or may be relied upon.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul Idzik.","Paul Thomas Idzik","Thank you. Good evening. It is a pleasure to be here speaking with you. I've come to learn a lot over the last 3 months, and I'm pleased to share my thoughts on the quarter and the company with you.","To begin, I want to make my mission here clear, which includes 3 things: first, to ruthlessly execute on the financial and capital plan laid out by management and the board nearly 1 year ago; second, to refine and intensify our focus within the brokerage franchise to drive a superior customer experience; and third, to maximize value for our owners.","As for how I'm spending my time, I'm focused on getting a deep understanding of what my colleagues do across the business and how it impacts our customers and our profitability and learning everything I can about the company and what I believe to be significant opportunities to improve customer engagement and satisfaction.","Now, my first quarter here was a busy one, and I'd like to address the more provocative items upfront, including the handful of management and board departures and the final sale of stock by our largest shareholder for the better part of 5 years.","On management departures, ensuring we have the right leadership team in place is a critical priority of mine, so I've been accordingly focused on reviewing the composition, roles and responsibilities of the executive committee since I arrived. First, consistent with the company's and my own philosophy to drive efficiency, I made the decision to eliminate the role of Chief Technology and Operations Officer. We are now in the midst of better aligning these functions to enhance the customer experience and get the most from each dollar spent.","On the marketing side, our team has done a good job creating compelling advertising and building brand awareness. However, given the current stage of the company's evolution, I saw a need for much sharper focus in our customer and prospect marketing, specifically more analytical decision-making and less emphasis on blanket advertising. Accordingly, I'm in the process of searching for a new marketing leader. I've seen a number of impressive candidates thus far and hope to make an announcement in the near future.","I also made an addition to the team during the quarter, bringing an experienced, long-standing colleague of mine, Mike Foley. Mike is leading the tech infrastructure and operations functions, as well as overseeing the marketing organization pending the completion of our search. Mike also brings a highly professional approach to project management, which is important at E*TRADE given the many initiatives and projects underlying the successful execution of our operational strategy and our continued success in serving our customers overall.","At the board level, we have 3 current members who have let us know that they do not wish to stand for reelection at the Annual Meeting on the 9th of May. The first is our Chairman, Frank Petrilli, who has been a board member since January 2012 and served as Interim CEO for nearly 6 of those months. Frank's decision relates to his other business and personal obligation. He leaves the Chairman position in capable hands with Rodger Lawson slated to assume the role. Roger's been a board member since February of 2012, served as Lead Independent Director during Frank's tenure as Interim CEO and brings a wealth of relevant industry experience through prior roles at Fidelity and Prudential. I've been working closely with Rodger, and I'm confident that his capabilities and judgment will serve our board and our shareholders well.","Another valued board member, Ron Fisher, who has been with the company since 2000, has decided to leave based on his increased responsibilities in his full-time job as President of SoftBank. Ron's professionalism and insight will be missed.","Finally, Ken Griffin, founder and CEO of Citadel. Kenneth decided not to stand for reelection following the final sale of his company's investment in E*TRADE. Since late 2007, Citadel has been our largest investor and Kenneth served on the board since 2009. Citadel, and Ken specifically, played a critical role in recapitalizing the company in both 2000, and again, in 2009. I will very much miss Ken's counsel, drive and insight on our board. On behalf of the board and management, I'd like to personally thank each one of these individuals for their commitments and contributions through the years.","Now moving on to the business and our results. Aside from some minor perturbations in the results, it was a decent quarter from a core business perspective. We posted a profit of $35 million or $0.12 per share and encouragingly recorded solid client metrics. Matthew will provide more detail on the financials, but to highlight one bright spot, as a result of capital generation and deleveraging, the bank's Tier 1 leverage ratio ended the quarter at 9.3%, just 20 basis points shy of the objective in our capital plan with 3 quarters of the year yet to go.","With respect to our core retail franchise, we helped clients reengage in a slightly more meaningful way this quarter as DARTs of 149,000 were up 16% sequentially. April to date, we're seeing a slight pullback with DARTs tracking down 5% from Q1 levels though up 1% from March. While retail investors across the industry remain understandably cautious, we are pleased with the activity we've seen thus far.","Derivatives continued to been an important component of how our customers engage with the market, and during quarter, options represented 24% of our DARTs, up slightly from a year ago. Net new brokerage assets for the quarter were a healthy $3.1 billion, representing an annualized growth rate of over 7%. We brought in 30,000 net new brokerage accounts, which is off the pace of 46,000 in the same quarter last year. While growing accounts is obviously core to our success in the brokerage business, the quality of these new accounts is of even greater importance. Our financial consultant network of approximately 270 professionals is key to that quality growth as they were responsible for about 35% of our net new assets. As a reminder, the accounts brought in through our FCs tend to be over 5x larger than those acquired through our other channels.","Beyond bringing new accounts on board, importantly, we are also doing a better job of retaining those accounts. With 8.5% annualized brokerage attrition in Q1, we posted an improvement of 130 basis points from the prior quarter and a 50 basis points improvement from the full year 2012. Deepening our relationship with customers through better service or assignment to an FC proves critical to doing more to help our customers, and in doing so, drive value for our shareholders.","We made a series of upgrades to our customer offering during the quarter, enhancing our customer education and research resources including thematic-based investing tools and significantly bolstering our already powerful Active Trader platform. We also hosted our second annual Retirement Education Day in New York, followed by events at each of our 30 branches, all with noteworthy attendance.","With customers increasingly disconnecting from desktop computing, our mobile platforms are an important component to fit customers' lifestyles. Within our 7 platforms offered, we launched a revamped tablet experience and enhanced our iPhone and Android platforms during the quarter, adding useful tools like mobile bill pay and access to index futures, giving customers better insight into the markets outside of traditional trading hours. Our mobile trade this quarter grew to over 7% of our DARTs, up from just under 6% a year ago.","Continually innovating and upgrading our industry-leading Active Trader platform, E*TRADE Pro, is core to maintaining our competitive edge. Recently, we significantly enhanced its capabilities with the integration of futures trading, allowing us to provide customers with a much more streamlined futures trading experience.","Within retirement investing, we continue to make progress as we gain traction with enhanced brand awareness and new and expanded products and services. We ended the quarter with $37 billion in retirement assets, an all-time high for the firm and inclusive of $15 billion of rollover assets. Net rollover flows for the quarter were $400 million, up 8% from the year-ago quarter.","Slightly more than 3 years after our launch, we are well ahead of our internal targets for growth in managed products. We ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in managed accounts, a 24% increase from the prior quarter and an 83% increase from the year-ago quarter. We are encouraged here and are working on ways to accelerate this growth. We've been hiding our capabilities here a bit under a bushel. As we do a great job for our customers and tell our story a bit better, I see some real potential for growth in these areas, along with helping our customers strengthen their financial health.","So in summary, it was a busy first quarter for me on the job. I'm pleased with the changes we've made to date and the direction this company is headed. I look forward to updating you next quarter as I continue to gain traction across the firm with our customers and with our owners.","With that, I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Matthew Audette.","Matthew J. Audette","Thank you, Paul. For the first quarter, we reported net income of $35 million or $0.12 per share. Our results included a couple of noteworthy items, which collectively did not impact our bottom line results. They are a $13 million benefit to provision for loan losses from a settlement with a third-party mortgage originator and restructuring and other severance related costs of $12 million, attributable to the company's cost reduction program and executive terminations.","Our first quarter net revenues were $420 million, down from $468 million in the prior quarter, which included deleveraging-related gains and $489 million in the year-ago quarter. Revenues included net interest income of $241 million, a 7% sequential decline as a result of 8 basis points of net interest spread compression, as well as a $2 billion reduction in the average balance sheet size. The decline in our spread this quarter was driven primarily by the continued runoff of our loan portfolio and reinvestment into lower yielding securities, as well as a slight increase in prepayment fees on the securities portfolio.","On the liability side, our cost of funding increased 3 basis points in the quarter, driven by an increase of FHLB funding costs related to the deleveraging actions we completed in the fourth quarter. Going forward, we expect FHLB funding rates to be roughly in line with this quarter.","We continue to expect our average net interest spread in 2013 to decline approximately 10 basis points from 2012's average, implying a full year spread of slightly below 230 basis points. I would also highlight that our Q1 results do not include the full impact of our deleveraging actions completed during the quarter. The majority of planned deleveraging is behind us, so there should be little in the way of proactive balance sheet reduction in the second half of this year.","Commissions, fees and service charges, principal transactions and other revenue in the first quarter were $164 million, up 8% from the prior quarter and down 5% from the same quarter of 2012. Average commission per trade was $11.30, up from $11.10 last quarter, largely as a result of an increase in the number of Stock Plan trades. Along with a more favorable customer mix is a smaller portion of trades came from Active Traders. Principal transactions revenue was down sequentially as a result of mix and the lowest levels of market volatility we have seen since late 2006.","Revenue in this quarter also included $15 million of net gains on loans of securities, down from $56 million in the prior quarter, which included deleveraging-related gains. Historically, gains have been in the range of $25 million to $35 million per quarter. Going forward, we expect them to be in the $10 million to $15 million range per quarter. However, while this is our expectation today, this range can be materially impacted by the interest rate environment and any deleveraging.","Our legacy loan portfolio ended the quarter at $10 billion, a contraction of approximately $500 million during the quarter. It is now down 69% from its peak. We expect loan runoff to average approximately $400 million per quarter for the rest of 2013, generally consistent with the 4% to 5% quarterly decline we have experienced for some time. This quarter's provision for loan losses was $43 million, including a $13 million benefit from a settlement related to loans purchased from a third-party mortgage originator. Since 2008, we have actively pursued these types of settlements amounting to approximately $420 million to date.","Excluding the benefit from this settlement, provision was $56 million, down from $74 million last quarter, relating primarily to lower charge-offs in the quarter. For the remainder of this year, barring any unforeseen external disruptions, we expect quarterly provision expense to be in the range of $50 million to $70 million. However, I must emphasize the nature of the quarterly provision is inherently uncertain. So this range, while our best estimate today, could vary meaningfully.","Total net charge-offs in the quarter were $68 million, down from $102 million in the prior quarter, and again, benefited from the $13 million settlement. Delinquencies in the quarter were down 9% sequentially in the 30- to 89-day category, reversing the seasonal increase we saw in Q4. The total allowance for loan losses ended the quarter at $455 million, down $26 million from last quarter and inclusive of $148 million specific reserves for modified loans.","Our coverage remains relatively constant for non-modified loans with this quarter's allowance covering 80% of loans at least 90 days past due. This compares to 76% last quarter. For modified loans, our total expected losses decreased from 37% in the prior quarter to 35% as of March 31.","During the quarter, we modified $34 million of loans, down from $44 million in the prior quarter, and again, representing the lowest quarterly level of modification since we began the program in 2009. We expect modifications to remain at low levels over the near term. However, we are monitoring the HELOC book closely with a focus on loans that are not yet amortizing. Once those loans do convert to amortizing, modification is one of the tools we could use as part of our overall loss mitigation strategy.","And I realize this topic has been an area of focus for many of you. As we have indicated in past presentations, these conversions will not take place in a material way until 2015 and beyond. Of our $3.2 billion HELOC portfolio, 26% are scheduled to convert in 2015, with an additional 40% in 2016. I would remind you that our average loan size is $75,000 and that during all of 2012, we saw annual voluntary principal reductions of at least $500 from 40% of our borrowers. And approximately half of those borrowers, or 20% of the total, reduced their principal balance by at least $2,500 during 2012. So this portfolio continues to shrink as a result of these paydowns as well as charge-offs. So at the point when these begin to amortize in a material way, we expect the balances to be smaller than they are today.","Moving on, as we continue to focus on derisking and deleveraging, we took additional steps this quarter to clean up our balance sheet. We sold approximately $230 million of nonagency CMOs from a legacy portfolio that has reduced in size from $1.8 billion at its peak in 2007 to just $14 million today. We are also planning to sell approximately $30 million of credit card loans that resided within the Consumer and Other portfolio. We expect the sale to close later in the year. Individually, these steps may not appear to be significant. However, taken together, they represent solid progress on our strategy to de-risk the bank.","Operating expenses for the quarter were $296 million, including $12 million of severance and restructuring-related charges. And to update you on the status of our expense reduction efforts and the buildout of our enterprise risk management capabilities, through Q1, we have implemented 85% of our targeted $110 million in cost savings. Additionally, we continue to expect our ongoing investment in ERM to total approximately $10 million annually.","Consistent with our plan, we expect the full $100 million in net savings to be included in our run rate in Q1 2014. For the remainder of 2013, keeping in mind that seasonality and market volumes can impact individual quarters, we expect our expense run rate to be in the range of $265 million to $280 million.","Turning to corporate cash. We ended the quarter at $352 million, a decline of $56 million from year-end levels and relating predominantly to seasonal compensation-related uses in addition to other intercompany allocations. For the remaining quarters of this year, we expect corporate cash to decline in line with our debt servicing costs, though there can be noise in the individual quarters relating to tax settlements and other intercompany allocations. I'd also point out that our current level of corporate cash represents approximately 3 years worth of debt service coverage.","Our capital ratios improved at the bank across all measures during the quarter with our Tier 1 leverage ratio ending the quarter at 9.3%, up 60 basis points from last quarter's and within striking distance of our 9.5% target. For all other bank risk-based ratios, we were between 20% and 22%, well in excess of regulatory minimums. At the parent, our ratios increased across the board as well. We ended the quarter with a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 6%, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter. Our risk-based measures at the parent are between 11% and 15%, again, well in excess of regulatory minimums. Our parent Tier 1 common ratio ended the quarter at 11.2%, and we estimate it would be approximately 100 basis points higher under the current Basel III proposed guidelines.","One more note on consolidated capital ratios. A yet to be enacted element of capital reform, outlined under Dodd-Frank, includes the ultimate exclusion of trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital. Initial guidance require companies to phase out TRUPs from inclusion in capital from the beginning of 2013 to 2016 with a quarter of the balance coming out each year. These changes have not yet been enacted by the regulators. So this transition out of capital has yet to begin. So we are still including 100% of our $433 million of TRUPs in our parent capital calculations. Had this phaseout begun in Q1, it would have reduced our parent Tier 1 leverage ratio by 30 basis points to 5.7% at quarter end.","Moving to progress on our capital plan. We have now completed the majority of our deleveraging actions which, in conjunction with earnings generation, have been integral to our efforts to bolster our bank leverage ratio with a focus on exceeding our target of 9.5%. During Q1, we completed $3 billion of deleveraging, which consists of $2.3 billion in sweep deposits transferred off balance sheet; $600 million of new customer cash directed to money funds; and $100 million of customer payables converted into money funds. We have another $500 million of sweep deposits scheduled to transfer off balance sheet this month. In total, this brings us to $8.4 billion, just shy of our stated goal of $8.5 billion. Accordingly, we do not have additional plans to deleverage beyond continuing to direct new customer cash to money funds.","However, it is important to keep in mind that customer activity is the great unknown when it comes to forecasting balance sheet size. So in the event that customer net selling leaves us with a need to reduce assets further, we do have additional actions we can take. Therefore, we are confident in our ability to exceed the target of 9.5% Tier 1 leverage at the bank, which is a central component of our capital plan.","In closing, in addition to the healthy results in our core business, we are quite satisfied with the progress made in our capital plan. Derisking, deleveraging, implementing enhanced enterprise risk management capabilities, cutting costs and improving our key capital ratios are all critical to achieving the objectives laid out in our strategic plan and were all areas where we made good progress during the quarter.","With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","So I guess the first question, given that you're tracking so well on the Tier 1 leverage ratio, the deleveraging plans, cost cutting, so if you get there earlier than, say, year end, could you accelerate the request through the regulators to upstream capital?","Matthew J. Audette","So Rich, so the leverage ratio is the most visible and measurable component of our plan. But just keep in mind, there are lots of other things that we're working on, right? We've got to continue to build out the enterprise risk management framework. We've got to finish the cost cutting. We've got to continue to improve our earnings, derisk the bank. So there's lots of things that we need to do to get to a point where we're comfortable making that request and where I think the regulators will be comfortable receiving that request. So our plans are just the same, Rich, towards the end of this year.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","But you wouldn't say that in these other areas, besides the visible Tier 1 -- that you're ahead of plan as well?","Matthew J. Audette","Well, I'd say I feel good about what we're working on. I think the capital ratios are very quantitative, so you can see exactly where you are. I mean, these -- a lot of these other areas are subjective. So we know what's important to work on. But we have to complete them. We have to implement them. We have to track how they're going. So I'd say in general, we are on track.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And Paul, I guess getting your views as a relative newcomer but now 3 months, you made some quick decisions or big decisions. So I guess the question is as you look at the firm now, what's your view on both risk management and the cost saves? I don't expect you to update targets on cost saves, but do you think it's -- from the beginning when you took over to now, are they easily achievable or -- as well as the overall risk management process at the firm?","Paul Thomas Idzik","Yes. I'd say in cost saves, those things are never easy because it always, in a firm like us, involves taking action with individuals. And that's always difficult. But we've communicated the process and where we are to our employees and we're very confident. We've achieved 85%. We've communicated the actions, they're going to take us over the top on the rest. So I'm feeling very good about the cost reduction. With regard to the risk management, we clearly had some work to do. I feel very good about the progress to date. My opinion, while very important, needs to be paired up with the opinion of the regulators. And we'll continue to work with them to improve on the risk management front. But I think we've made a lot of progress in the last year. And certainly, I've seen a lot of progress in the 3 months I'm here. And importantly, what I'm seeing is many, many more of my colleagues actively involved in putting that front and center what they do as they try and help customers. So sorry, Rich, it was a little long there, but I feel good about both those areas.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","And one last quick thing, Matt. On the bank loans, the gain of loss on loans, to go -- essentially, it looks like you're cutting the gain run rate in half. And I guess can you give us a little bit more color on the chain? I know the interest rate environment played a big -- but that seems like an abrupt thing that's going to impact the models here.","Matthew J. Audette","Sure, Rich. I think we've -- I've tried to indicate over the long term we would expect gains to come down. I think when you look at the last 6 months, meaning the second half of 2012, we had a lot of deleveraging going on and planning for some of the deleveraging that we're going to be doing this quarter, so you had a lot of activity there. I think now that most of the deleveraging is done, the gain on sale is going to come down with respect to that. But keep in mind, of course, that, that rate can change based on any additional deleveraging need and changes in the interest rate environment. But where we sit right now, 10 to 15 is how we view it per quarter going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Howard Chen.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Matt, I'm having a little difficulty reconciling the $268 million, $280 million expense run rate guidance with continuing to realize and make steady progress with the $100 million net saving plan over the course of the year. Can you help kind of square those 2 items up?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure, Howard. So looking at Q1, a few things to keep in mind. First, you've got the $12 million of severance and restructuring-related costs in there. Second, Q1 is seasonally our highest quarter. So if you just look at our marketing expenses, right, our expectation is to spend $30 million less in 2013 than 2012, which would put us at a total spend for the year in roughly the $110 million range. And we spent a large -- our biggest quarter is going to be Q1, right? So the quarters for the rest of the year, they're going to be much smaller. Compensation and benefits, Q1 is seasonally the highest quarter on comp and ben, right? You've got the benefit expenses, taxes start over, people take a lot less vacation. So it's just a seasonally high quarter. So when you factor those things out, that's kind of where the range comes from, Howard. And I think hopefully, when you write those down, it should make sense.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right. And maybe just to walk through it. I must be missing something. But if I strip out the $12 million of severance and restructuring for this quarter and you just run it at the midpoint of the $260 million to $280 million. You get just shy of $1.1 billion of expenses. And that's, call it, down $50 million from the beginning point of when you announced that $100 million net plan. So I guess that's where I'm having difficulty bridging the gap.","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. So if you just do that, Howard, you're annualizing comp and ben, which is for the Q1, it's typically high. And the same thing with marketing, right? We've got $37 million of marketing and we plan to spend around $110 million for the whole year, right? So those things are going to come down later in the year.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, all right. And then a quick -- another numbers question. The $4 million of equity income and investment this quarter, what's the nature of that and what's the outlook for just future contributions there?","Matthew J. Audette","So the outlook is pretty small, Howard. So it is -- if you go way back into the company's history, 10-plus years, we had some venture funds that we still have one of them left today. And we update the value of that fund every quarter. It's typically very small and it's noise. We had some components in there that had big gains in the quarter. So it came from that venture fund. But if we were to see something like this in the future, I'd be surprised. I'd be pleasantly surprised, but I'd be surprised.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Just one clarification. Is that markup or harvesting?","Matthew J. Audette","Markup.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joel Jeffrey.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question. In terms of the interest earning assets, I appreciate the color in terms of the efforts you're making on the deleveraging side. But can you give us a sense for where the asset level ended the quarter?","Matthew J. Audette","The interest earning assets?","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Matthew J. Audette","Yes, about $500 million less than the average.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just another bit of a housekeeping question. In terms of the $12 million in severance and restructuring charges, how much of that was in the comp line and how much was in the restructuring line?","Matthew J. Audette","So the majority of the restructuring line was severance, right? So that's $7.5 million was in restructuring. The majority of that was severance. So I'd say roughly $5 million was back in comp and ben.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, I apologize if I missed this earlier, but the increase in the fees and service charge line, is that driven by higher payment for order flow? Or is there something else in there?","Matthew J. Audette","So the biggest item in that category is payment for order flow. So in general, it should move in line with commissions, and you saw it increase. So that would be the main item.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I want to go back on the discussion for potentially getting some dividend out of the bank on to the Holdco and the regulatory approval process that you guys are going through. Paul, one of the things you mentioned is derisking the bank. You guys are selling $30 million of credit card loans. Is that something that we should think about as more of a viable option for you guys in the current environment where real estate prices are maybe a little bit better and maybe there's a little more of a bid for riskier assets for you to, I guess, derisk the bank more aggressively by actually selling either the first liens or the home equity loans?","Matthew J. Audette","This is Matt. I'll take that one. So the credit card one was more of a tactical item similar to the CMO sales we did. When you go back to the loan portfolio, we pay very close attention to the best way to maximize value for our shareholders on that portfolio. Keeping it, managing the way we have versus if there's anything to do in the secondary market. So things are definitely improving overall. I think it's one of the reasons we saw provision come down. Home prices are going up, which helps. But the dynamic of does it make more sense to sell it versus keep it, hasn't changed. So our intention is to continue to do what we've been doing.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then I guess along similar lines, you mentioned reserves and the provisions for the quarter. I guess when we look at the first lien book, it looks like even after you adjust for the settlement, you guys still released some reserves in the book. Can you walk us through the rationale there?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure, Alex. I think from the allowance, we always focus on it overall. So keep in mind, the charge-offs came down pretty much in line. We've got provisions coming down. I think that the majority or the vast majority of that settlements, the $13 million, was in the one-to-four book. But I think broadly, when you look at the performance, even just looking at the charge-offs, the charge-offs for the one-to-four book came down dramatically as well. So I wouldn't focus on the individual bucket. I think it's more overall. And then keeping in mind the home equity book came down a little bit less as well. So I don't think there's anything to that other than the settlement came into that line item.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Yes, I mean, just even excluding the settlement, it's still an add back. That's why it didn't -- it looks like allowance to total liquidities has been coming down pretty progressively over the last few quarters. And I just wonder, if house prices continue to recover, is that, I guess, the area where we should see more relief on the provision side?","Matthew J. Audette","Oh, sure.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And it seems like that was the only difference, I guess, this quarter.","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. So continued improvements in home prices would certainly benefit the one-to-four book more than the home equity book just because the home equity book is primarily second lien versus the one-to-four is going to be a first lien. So improvements in the collateral are going to help more on the one-to-four side. So that's certainly part of the dynamic.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then the last one for me, I just want to spend a second, I guess, on the roll forward for net interest income, how should we think about, I guess, some of the rates. I guess one of the things you highlighted for a decline in the yields you guys earned in the securities portfolio is a pickup in prepaid speeds. I find it a little surprising given the fact that rates have come up during the quarter and I think generally what we've heard so far in the quarter, that prepayments have slowed down and not the other way. So I guess maybe you can help us understand how much of the drag the prepayments were in the quarter and whether or not that rate should, I guess, pick up a little bit as prepayments maybe continue to slow.","Matthew J. Audette","Sure. So it was -- if you look at the overall spreads, so 230 basis points for the quarter, so the impact of those prepayments was about 5 basis points, meaning if we didn't have them, it would be around 235. And then if you look at the individual months, we primarily saw it in January and February. We did see a slowdown in March. For what we can see so far in April, it's continuing to slow down. So from what we see right now, we don't expect that prepayment pickup we saw in January, February to continue into Q2. So that's what we've seen so far.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. So you should see a little bit of recovery there. And most of that is in held to maturity or available for sale?","Matthew J. Audette","I'd look at -- I'd view it as both books together.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to actually keep on the NII and net interest spread. Matt, you mentioned that the full impact of deleveraging was not reflected in the spread. I'm just wondering what that would have been if it had been fully in place for the quarter?","Matthew J. Audette","Well, just going back to the earlier question on the ending interest earning assets. They're about $500 million less than the average. And then we've got plans for another $500 million of deleveraging in the month of April. So those are the 2 things I would add to that.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. But you would expect the spread to remain around the $230 million that we saw reported for the quarter?","Matthew J. Audette","Well, I wouldn't comment on the individual quarters. Our expectation for the year is to be slightly below $230 million. I don't have precise numbers on you for Q2, Q3 and Q4 individually, though.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","No, I was just asking for the first quarter, if there was more info on the deleverage. But I guess -- yes, just on the outlook, I mean, obviously, you had pretty material move in rate since the beginning of the year. That hasn't factored into the outlook for the full year or it hasn't changed it materially?","Matthew J. Audette","It has not. I mean, if you look at all the individual nuances that go into a yield -- or a spread forecast, things are always moving. But our overall view has not changed.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Keith Murray.","Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Can we spend a minute on the provision guidance? You talked about the $50 million to $70 million. I know, obviously, it's a wide range there. But should we be thinking about it, that provision should generally be getting close to matching net charge-offs?","Matthew J. Audette","No, not necessarily. I mean, I don't have charge-off guidance for you other than the ultimate guidance of as the loan portfolio ultimately disappears, the allowance itself is ultimately going to disappear. But I think for 2013 perspective, the guidance is really just on provision. So that's $50 million to $70 million.","Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then on the TRUPs that you mentioned, if you were to call them or replace them, do you have a guess at this point if that would equate to savings on the interest expense side?","Matthew J. Audette","Well, I don't. I think it's more back in the bucket of what would we do with capital, if and when we get out the bank at the parent, kind of thinking about the different uses for that capital. But that's not something that we can do today. So I think we've looked at what the best use of that capital was at that time and TRUPs could be one of the things that we would look at or could look at.","Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And then finally, is there the potential for any more settlements with other mortgage originators?","Matthew J. Audette","There is potential, but not much. I mean, I think we're looking at a handful of things. I'd put them in the bucket of single-digit range from settlement purposes. So I'd say that largely our settlements are behind us. And if we have anything of size in the future, I think we would be pleasantly surprised by that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just on the balance sheet. So if we look after the second quarter, when we get into the second half, is your assumption you get the regulatory approval and then keep the balance sheet basically as is -- I mean, obviously, it depends on what clients do, but you can offload some of that to third parties or money market funds in terms of cash, but in the near term, kind of stick around on the current levels?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes, Mike. I mean, the customer activity is the big item that moves the size of the balance sheet. But as far as our expected deleveraging actions, we've got that $500 million planned for this month and then just continuing to direct new customer cash to money funds, which is not a dramatic amount, but it'll be a small amount. So that's really all we have planned for now.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then just on that provision, the $50 million to $70 million, it just seems like if we look over the past 3 years, credit quality continues to improve. The provision has declined pretty consistently over time. Obviously, there's been kind of one-offs in there. But if we look at the adjusted provision for the quarter, being around 56, it just seems like $50 million to $70 million seemed a little bit on the high end. Is that like conservatism? Is it you just don't know, other things can pop up like they have in the past? It just seems like it's a little bit higher than just given where the credit trends are and just given were the current provision is.","Matthew J. Audette","Well, a year from now, looking back, I hope you're right. But it's definitely our best estimate today. I mean, and if we go back 2, 3 years individual quarters, it definitely moves around. So we're giving you the best information, or best insight that we have at $50 million to $70 million.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And Paul, just one thing, you mentioned some of the growth areas. Just anything that -- and granted it's early and maybe we'll get more updates next quarter or the quarter after, but just any, maybe 1 or 2 areas that kind of stand out where you feel like there's more opportunity just given who E*TRADE is or your background that can drive some growth going forward?","Paul Thomas Idzik","Yes. I think there are 2 areas clearly we're making good progress. One is in managed product where we're constructing products that provide the type of risk and return profile that our clients are finding attractive. And clearly, our overall investment product space is an area that we can absolutely continue to grow. And I would also say we have the opportunity to do more for existing customers across a number of products, and I think we'll be looking to just continue increasing the intimacy with customers, and therefore, gaining a little greater sure of what they're doing each day with us.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Can you -- just going back to the capital plan, if you do get to where you want to be by year end, can you just outline again through the priorities of what you think you would do to deploy excess capital, I guess, between, as we said in the past, paying down debt, the 2 large tranches that are callable in later '14 and then '15 versus, say, a share buyback or paying down the wholesale borrowing?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure, Brian. So the wholesale borrowing, I think, is more of a bank capital thing. But I think once we have capital up at the parent, we would look at all those things, right. Our guiding principle here is going to be what's in the best interest of our shareholders and also keeping in mind that we have, in addition to the OCC at the bank, we have a regulator at the parent called the Fed. And they're certainly going to have a view and input on what we would do with capital at the parent. So we would just have to work through all those things at that time.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right. So you're just keeping it [indiscernible] at this stage. Is the share buyback a possibility?","Matthew J. Audette","We would look at everything. Again, keeping in mind our regulators' input, as well as what's in the best interest for the shareholders.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just on the principal transactions, the market-making business, are there any structural changes in your business there? Or is it really just a factor of market volume, and as you mentioned, volatility going forward for this year?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes, well, in the quarter, it was definitely volatility, right? That was the big driver of our reduction in the revenues there, reducing principal transactions from -- down to that roughly $22 million for the quarter. I don't have a comment on the rest of the year, just that was really the impact on Q1.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just -- and while we're on seasonality, obviously the Stock Plan business is very strong in the first quarter. You've given your efforts on the growth and bringing in relatively decent net new asset numbers. Can you sort of comment on what your view is coming into the second quarter, whether we'll see any kind of negative seasonality comps versus the first quarter given the strong Stock Plan business? Or do you feel that you're making pretty good progress on the FC side that might offset that?","Matthew J. Audette","Well, Brian, Q1 is definitely the best quarter, the biggest quarter on the Stock Plan side. And then keeping in mind, just on the asset side, the proceeds that come through Stock Plan, we typically keep 35% after 3 months and 15% at the end of the year. So you're going to have a natural outflow later in the year. But that happens every year. So I think if you look at our historical -- look at the past couple of years and just look at the trends that happen in the individual quarters, that's probably going to be the best guide there on what we would see for this coming year.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just lastly, a question for Paul. Just, you mentioned, obviously, the growth opportunities. Can you talk about whether there's any interest in venturing into the RIA channel that Ameritrade and Schwab and Fidelity are in? Or would you rather continue to focus on the advice and guidance and retirement planning segment, investing incremental capital or incremental dollars in that area?","Paul Thomas Idzik","The RIA channel is something that this company has tried in the past and it didn't turn out well for our shareholders. And so that's unlikely to be anything that features in our future, at least in the short term. We think we have a lot to offer by continuing to provide better tools for FCs, our existing FCs, so they can help our customers more, and adding FCs over time. So I think we don't have any intention of changing a model that we see is doing quite well for our customers and increasingly well for our shareholders.","So I want to thank all of you for joining us this evening. And that will conclude the call, and we'll see you next quarter. Thank you. Good night.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Good evening, and thank you for joining us on our Q2 earnings call. After a resounding start to the year, in Q2, we delivered solid operating metrics, great financial performance and steady progress across our core initiatives. Even with reduced volatility, customers remain remarkably active in Q2. ","Trading remained robust, margin balances hit another all-time record and our customers remained engaged with the markets as net buying reached $9.8 billion year-to-date. Meanwhile, the team has been tirelessly executing on our core initiatives. We boosted customer engagement, particularly in derivatives, which hit a new high as a percentage of total DARTs at 34%, as the recent rollout of new tools and capabilities took root. We enhanced our investing offering with substantial additions to our commission-free ETF program, significant enhancements to the digital experience and a marketing campaigns squarely focused on promoting our advice offering for the everyday investor. ","We implemented $11 billion in corporate service plan assets, bringing implementations for the year to $14.5 billion. While refilling the pipeline to a robust $9 billion, further solidifying our place as the category leader. ","And lastly, we completed the acquisition of TCA, onboarding the associated cash balances and transitioning the team in early April. There is much in flight and much to be excited about surrounding this new channel, which I'll cover in a bit. ","Financially speaking, it was another quarter of blockbuster results. We delivered strong revenue, and we expanded our adjusted operating margin for the seventh consecutive quarter to 46%. We repurchased 3 million shares, completing $690 million of our current $1 billion program, leaving us on track to finish by year-end. And we opportunistically tapped the capital markets to issue new senior notes to redeem our legacy trust preferred securities at a lower all in-cost. ","Turning back to our core initiatives, we're delivering on our promise to active traders. Our Power E*TRADE program coupled with the onslaught of new tools and capabilities has struck the right cord. We see it in a greater number of customers entering our active tradings here, an increase in new customers trading options, and ultimately, in our strong growth in DARTs and our outsized improvement in derivatives trades, we have increased our level of service for active traders and rolled out significant product enhancements, including some very recent ones such as, a Risk Slide tool to help customers quantify and visualize the impact of market events, income tools, to seamlessly add options for stock positions in one click, custom options grouping, to deliver greater control and visibility to complex strategies, and last but not least, a live-action scanning tool on mobile so traders can identify unusual options activity and volatility while on the go. ","This was also an important quarter in terms of enhancements to our investing and managed product offering, defined by a singular vision, to deliver the products our customers want in a way it is extraordinarily easy to use. ","As noted earlier, we further expanded our commission-free ETF lineup to more than 250 funds, including 32 Vanguard ETFs, which are some of the most popular in the market. E*TRADE is now the only major online broker to offer these ETFs commission free. Underscoring our commitment to put our customers first and impartially deliver the products and services they want. ","We launched a new ETF research page with one of the most intuitive screeners around. We significantly enhanced our robo-adviser, core portfolios, making onboarding far easier and jargon-free while adding tax-sensitive smart beta and socially responsible investments. ","Lastly and most recently, we introduced our simplest managed product offering yet. The E*TRADE prebuilt portfolios. For investors in search of diversification with a low account minimum and no management fee, we offered 3 ETF portfolios based on risk tolerance, conservatives, moderate or aggressive. ","The power of this offering lies in its simplicity. Investors can select and execute their trades in only 2 clicks. Truly, it has never been easier to start investing. ","Building on recent enhancements to our industry-leading mobile platform, the team is hard at work, improving the customer experience to drive even deeper engagement. We want our customers to feel like they can do just about anything, whether it's opening an account, uploading documents using device's camera or evaluating option strategies, using our technical analysis tools, all from the palm of their hand. ","And over the coming months, our marketing team will bolster our renewed investing vigor. This summer, which started with World Cup Soccer and extends through U.S. Open Tennis, we will run a campaign that reinforces the message that E*TRADE is the home for the digitally inclined retail investor, who seeks a broker that is exceptionally easy to use. And as I've noted before, marketing is far more than advertising. And our brand must be infused with all that we say and do. And so on parallel tracks, we've also continued to enhance our prospect site, coupled with further refining how we speak to and connect with our audience through all channels to communicate in a more human and refreshing way. ","Within corporate services, the momentum of new business wins shows no signs of slowing. As I mentioned, we implemented nearly $11 billion in plan assets, covering 111,000 participants during the quarter, of which the majority were related to a single client win. This brings our year-to-date implementations to $14.5 billion, already more than doubling the total implementations for all of 2017. ","Despite this impressive piece of onboarding, we substantially replenished the pipeline, leaving it at $9 billion to start the third quarter. ","In May, I had an opportunity to connect with many of our clients at our Directions Conference. The premier and longest-running stock plan administration conference in our industry. The conference is attended by existing clients as well as prospects. And on all fronts, the feedback on our offering was clear. No one is better in this space when it comes to technology and service quality. The team is relentlessly driven to innovate and acutely focused on meeting the ever-evolving needs of our clients. ","Turning now to acquisitions. I'm extremely excited by both the opportunities in front of us and the results we've obtained. With the Capital One accounts, the team is hard at work, mapping out the post-conversion strategy to showcase the full breadth of our offerings and drive greater engagement with our new customers. We've recently moved the closing date to Q4 to ensure a great first experience with E*TRADE for the roughly 1 million relationships coming on board. ","TCA has been part of the family for about 3 months now, and the transition has been exceptionally smooth. Our new business momentum continues just as we put the strength of our brand behind it. Meanwhile, we are working diligently to put in place a referral program, which will truly round out our offering, extending our capabilities to the high net-worth customers who typically have more complex financial needs. ","And very importantly, we continued to reap the benefits of our OptionsHouse acquisition, now nearly 2 years post deal closed, driving improved metrics and expending the platform and offerings to our most active trading client base.","Taken together, these efforts demonstrate the team's proven ability to identify compelling opportunities, seamlessly integrate selective acquisition into our ecosystem and create significant shareholder value in the process. ","As for our operating metrics, DARTs for the quarter came in at 259,000, up 24% from the year-ago quarter and marked the second best quarter in our history. While activity moderated from Q1's chart-topping levels, retail activity remained resilient with monthly DARTs progressing higher each month of the quarter to June's level of 273,000. ","Our derivative DARTs of 87,000 were up over 30% from the year-ago quarter, and reflected a 34% share of total DARTs, representing our strongest mix ever. ","The continued progress on this front illustrates the significant opportunity embedded within our brokerage business. Further evidence to the remarkable customer engagement is the $9.8 billion in net buying through the first half of 2018, which has already exceeded 2017's full year record of $9.2 billion of net buying. ","While this degree of activity undoubtedly puts pressure on brokerage cash, which dropped below 14% of brokerage assets during the quarter, the robust trading activity and record customer margin balance of $11 billion, counterbalances some of the industry-wide pressure on deposit levels. ","Activity has come in a bit from what we reported in the quarter with July-to-date DARTs tracking down around 12% from June and margin balances declining slightly. Net new brokerage accounts adjusted for the acquisition of TCA were 40,000 in the quarter, which puts us at a solid trailing 12-month growth rate of 4.8%. ","Net new brokerage assets of $2.5 billion included an unusually high level of tax payments by our customers in April, offset by healthy inflows from new customers. While seasonality certainly played a role, our flows were in line with the year-ago quarter and well above the historical trend for the second quarter. ","Over the last 12 months, we have generated over $13 billion of net new asset flows. And on assets, I'd like to highlight one significant inflow this quarter that is not captured in our net new asset line. Approximately $4.5 billion invested equity securities brought into corporate services. Along with the superior growth of our new clients pipeline, we have been challenging historical conventions around the onboarding process to eliminate roadblocks. One key area of our focus has been the transfer of vested shares attached to existing equity plans, like employee stock purchase plans and restricted stock grants where incumbent stock plan providers historically drew a hard line to retain those assets. ","We have worked diligently with our new clients to help them cut those ties, ensuring E*TRADE can service the entire relationship and realized material benefits from these efforts in the quarter. As you may know, we do not register an inflow until there is activity in the account. An admittedly conservative approach but similar to all inflows, these added assets and relationships have a positive impact on our franchise and our earnings power. ","Finally, with respect to managed assets, we grew balances by $230 million during the quarter to $5.8 billion, driven almost entirely by net inflows, providing additional evidence of our ability to succeed in the investor segment just as we begin the full-court press of our brand and marketing efforts. In closing, it was another solid quarter in which we made significant progress in enhancing our customer offering, collected a few more records to display in our trophy case and set our sights squarely on the remaining work we must do to continue to drive growth and superior returns for our shareholders. ","I look forward to our third quarter call this fall, when we'll share the board's assessment of our progress and discuss our go-forward objectives. ","With that, I will turn it over to our CFO, Mike Pizzi.","Michael Pizzi","Thanks, Karl. For the quarter, we reported net income of $250 million or $0.95 per share on record net revenues of $710 million, up $133 million from the year-ago quarter. During the quarter, we had a couple of unique items which benefited pretax earnings by $23 million, including a $19 million benefit to provision for loan losses and $4 million in gains related to CRA equity investments. ","As for our core results, net interest income increased by $8 million, as our net interest margin expanded by 5 basis points when relatively flat asset balances. The key drivers of the improvement were higher interest rates, a higher average margin balance and better investment yields. Partially offsetting the improvement was higher deposit costs and an $8 million sequential decline or a 5-basis point drag in securities lending revenue, which trended closer to historical levels. Average interest-earning assets remained flat despite the onboarding of TCA in April, driven by exceptionally strong customer buying, resulting in lower deposit balances.","The changes we made to our deposit rates late in the quarter were geared at bringing our prices closer to the competitive set and included an element of catchup. Going forward, we expect to move rates closer to our model betas. For Q3, we expect the blended deposit rate, including customer payables to approach 20 basis points, up from the 9 basis points paid in Q2. ","The improvement in interest rates should continue to drive positive momentum in NII. Based on the recent upward movement in the belly of the curve, our average reinvestment rate in the securities portfolio is now in the 300 to 320 basis point range, up 20 basis points from the prior quarter. For the full year of 2018, we are still forecasting NIM to fall within the range of 300 to 310 basis points, assuming a steady Fed funds rate and customer margin balances at current levels. ","If the Fed moves rates in September, we anticipate we would land above the midpoint of the range, all else at equal. Commission revenue of $121 million increased 15% year-over-year, but fell 12% sequentially. While DARTs of 259,000 were down 16%, the result still represent our second-best quarter on record, partially offsetting the decline in DARTs is a $0.04 expansion and commission per trade to $7.31, aided by a richer mix of derivatives in the period. ","The continued migration of customers towards our Active Trading pricing tier and an increased contribution from future's trades should pressure average commission per trade for the rest of the year, which we expect to land in the $7.10 to $7.20 range, acknowledging derivative mix can move us outside this range in any period. Fees and service charges increased $5 million to $110 million in the quarter, reflecting the addition of TCA, partially offset by a reduction of order flow revenue on lower volume. The average yield on third-party cash was up three basis points to 138 basis points in the quarter. We anticipate generating 141 basis points on third-party cash in Q3.","Gains on loans and securities increased $5 million sequentially to $15 million, driven by the $4 million CRA-related gain. Given our larger overall portfolio size and greater weighting to securities, we now expect gains to be in the $5 million to $10 million range per quarter. We recorded the $19 million provision benefit, which included $15 million in net recoveries. Our allowance for loan losses now stands at $54 million, while the runoff portfolio continues to decline ending the quarter at $2.4 billion.","Moving to expenses, noninterest expense was $384 million, down $11 million from the prior quarter. This quarter's adjusted operating margin, which excludes provision benefit was 46%, an improvement of 180 basis points from the prior quarter. Total marketing expense was $47 million down from the Q1 spend of $60 million, which included the cost of the Super Bowl ad as well as normally higher seasonal spending. We are still tracking to our initial plan of roughly $200 million in marketing spend for 2018. ","Compensation expense was $160 million, up $8 million sequentially, reflecting the addition of TCA, an additional headcount primarily in service for the integration of Capital One customers and onboarding of new corporate service accounts. We believe the second quarter reflects a fair quarterly run rate and fits within our operating margin framework. As before, several seasonal factors could cause some volatility on this line at any given quarter. We continue to expect our full year 2018 adjusted operating margin to surpass 45%. ","A rate hike in September could provide an incremental boost to that margin, and should add about 10 basis points for the full year. A couple of highlights on the capital front. First, as Karl mentioned, we repurchased 3 million shares at an average price of $62.51 for $188 million during the quarter. As of the end of Q2, we have executed $690 million of our $1 billion authorization, and we expect to complete the program at a relatively measured pace through the end of 2018. ","Second, we are opportunistically redeeming $413 million of trust preferred securities with our June issue and sub-senior notes. We anticipate that we will record a $4 million charge for early extinguishment of debt in Q3, associated with the redemption of the TRUPs. The vast majority of which were redeemed earlier this week. Based on current LIBOR rates, we will generate modest savings from the refinancing. As for corporate cash, we ended the quarter at $943 million, up $504 million sequentially. The increase is largely driven by a timing difference between our recent June debt issuance and the redemption of our TRUP securities. ","Also contributing to the cash balance was a $176 million dividend payment from the bank, and $100 million dividend payment from the broker-dealer offset by share repurchases. For Q3, we anticipate $300 million in total dividends to the parent. ","In closing, Q3 was another great quarter, and we are more than pleased with our continued momentum. ","With that, we'll open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.","Chinedu Bolu","So just sounds like the team is really executing well on corporate services, and growth has starting to accelerate here. But just like a little bit color on sustainability. I think you've talked about tailwinds from competitors transitioning to new systems. I guess one's that -- one that's over, can you sustain growth? And then now that you have TCA fully into the family at E*TRADE, are there any more details in terms of how you plan to integrate that with the corporate services business?","Karl Roessner","Sure, Christian. And thank you for the question, it's a good one. And I think everyone knows that I do like to speak about this business. So starting off with this one is a pleasure for me. Putting together the corporate services offering that we have and getting the team of people who drive the way they do for the request for proposal and the opportunities for new business has been pretty a dedicated effort from the management team, putting the right people in place, getting the right sales folks out there to go talk to the larger corporate clients coming into play. There is a onetime window, call it up the next 1 to 3 years. I believe we're -- so 1 to 3 years, call it we're about the middle of that period, so next 18 to 24 months where there are still many corporates who are served by companies or stock plan providers who are changing to that more technology-forward model.","They're outsourcing the provision to a technology provider. So there's still opportunity there for us. So I think continued growth, sustained growth that we'll see. We will absolutely win our fair share, we're doing quite well in that space. I think we're probably looking another 18 to 24 months of a good opportunity set for us. Longer-term, as they've built this pipeline, obviously, that pipeline of corporate clients that we have, they continue to issue equity whether that being options or restricted stock. And those stock plan participants become E*TRADE customers. It's being able to use our retail brokerage to really go out and get into that market space, get in front of these stock plan participants, early and often. So starting with an education offering, making sure that we are on the campuses of the corporates, introducing them to E*TRADE, using our new investing advice continuum, everything from our robo at our core portfolios, up to the ETF portfolios that I mentioned, the three that we just launched, I mean, some of the managed products.","And then you talk about what we've done with TCA, right? What was that about? We have a number of RIAs on that platform now who we would be very comfortable, we've been doing a lot of work in the background, putting into a referral programs so that those stock plan participants looking for additional investing advice, looking for an RIA, we can introduce them to those RIAs on our custody platform and keep that relationship with E*TRADE, right? A broader relationship with E*TRADE is everything that we're after. So TCA, first and foremost, is really about growing the assets that come on to E*TRADE, so continuing to grow our asset base. But also looking at additional ways to serve both our corporate services clients, their stock plan participants and our retail brokerage base when those customers either get into a tier where they're looking for an investment adviser, looking for additional help with their finances. That's the time when we lose some of those assets to the RIA channels. We now have the ability to maintain that customer relationship through the RIAs on TCA's platform. So a lot of work going on in the referral program in the background. I believe by late fall, we'll have it up and running. And I look forward to talking to you more about it.","Chinedu Bolu","Great. And maybe some for Mike. Just can you give us a bit more update on how you're thinking about, I guess, the yield's sensitivity of client cash? You know balances haven't moved here, haven't grown for over a year. You had to move up rates to catch up to peers. I do appreciate there's a lot of net buying. But also curious if there is more yield-seeking behavior? And ultimately, how does that inform you about long-term trajectory for balance sheet growth?","Michael Pizzi","Yes. Looking at kind of where we are year-to-date net buying, we had a strong year last year in terms of the net buying and we're outpacing it this year. So it is really the net buying activity that is putting pressure on the overall cash balances. We're at a lower percentage of average cash per count that we've been at in quite some time. Looking at it, we spent some time really to parsing up the data and looking at sort of what customers are doing, to see if there is yield-seeking behavior in that net buyer. Are they buying money funds, are they buying other products that are sort of cash, cash-like? And then that's not the case. It's -- while we see a little bit of pick up in that, it's a relatively small amount relative to the net buy flow versus the extremely -- more than -- well more than the majority, 90% range is really just buying what you would think, it's that large cap, mega cap U.S. tax stocks, there's bank stocks, that is where we see the net buying, that's where we see the money flow going. So it's really in each way in the market. And you can see that's backed up at a couple of other areas too with the growth and the margin book, is correlates very well for that sort of risk appetite. So it's really not any medium or major increase in yield-seeking behavior, although, we do see a little bit of that. It is really just net buying of U.S. equities.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Harris","Can you guys talk a little bit about the changes you've made with the deposit rates? I guess, what I'm wondering is did you increase them across the board? Or they're a little bit more targeted than that? We noticed that you did launch a high-yield savings account, I think, during the quarter. Is that driving a lot of the increase?","Michael Pizzi","Yes, I'm mean, we raised rates a little bit to catchup in terms of marketing -- good market position across balanced tiers. Now obviously, the higher balanced cash is where we see more of the sensitivity. So we increased rates the most on the higher-balanced tiers versus the lower-balanced tiers. So the lower-balanced tiers really being kind of money and motion. We really didn't affect those rates very much versus the upper balance. We did increase -- we did offer a couple of higher rates balanced tiers as well to customers that wanted to -- on a negotiated basis, were looking for more rates and we're seeing -- we would -- seeing some of that flow in the money funds. It's economic for us to keep some of that money on balance sheet, and we opened those tiers up in customers payables overall. The higher savings product is a product that we introduced a little while ago. It is simply we see customers moving some money. It's not a lot but moving some money to higher-rate banks. Us being a bank, we have the ability to offer that product. We have the ability to keep that money in-house. We did a pretty thorough analysis to the economics of offering that product, and it's pretty reasonable to capture that share and keep it in-house.","Christopher Harris","Okay, that's helpful. And the strategy from here, now that you guys are a little bit more closer in line with the peers. Will you be moving rates, kind of following peers going forward? Or is that going to be sort of a case-by-case evaluation you'll do as rates continue to go up, if they go up?","Michael Pizzi","Yes, look I think we'll always be mindful of what our competition is doing in the competitive set. But we would expect the products to be in line really with the historic or model betas. That's going to get you something approximately in the 20% sort of range. That's kind of what we would expect over the next near-term of several Fed fund hikes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard Repetto","I guess, the first question is for Mike. And I just heard you said, I think you said something about a 20% beta. When we go through the numbers and you had 9 basis points of blended deposit cost, this quarter going to 20. I'm getting some much -- am I calculating that wrong? ","Michael Pizzi","No. No. That's exactly what we said. What you saw this quarter was a bit of catchup, there's a bit of catchup coming through from -- effectively when we were operating at a near 0 beta for the first few rate hikes, and an alignment really within the competitive environment. We would expect betas from this point forward, really to align really what they were historically. So if you think about it, kind of what we moved in March is kind of how we think we're going to be moving going forward. Not what we did sort of on the June hike, where we caught up a little bit in overall market positions. So you're right. What you see is going to be a little bit higher. But I would expect it to be kind of around 20%, with the possibility of a little bit of more negotiated pressure on that. But right around that 20% level.","Richard Repetto","Okay, all right. Could be it, I'm calculating 45% off of this but I get it. So I guess the next question, the follow-up question would be for Karl. And I guess, since you are -- I guess, could you give us some insight into the board. How the board looks at your asset gathering capability relative to the other growth goals? I know you spend a lot of time talking about corporate services. I didn't understand exactly the $4.5 billion. How that plays in? But I guess, you are running below the low end now. And are there other alternatives besides corporate services TCA to get this ramped up into the range?","Karl Roessner","Okay. So, look, Richard, it's a good question. Growth goals, we've been through this, we set them up with the board and the management team, really, to reignite growth at each rate. I think that's exactly what we've done in terms of the value that we've created and what we've been able to bring to the table for the last nearly two years now, so seven quarters of continued improvement on op margin. The way that I look at the model and the way that I look at our asset gathering and what we've done so far, the returns that we generate on our assets are still 2 to 3x better than our peers. So I think our business model continues to work, and we continue to drive at that. On the asset gathering side, ramping up in terms of where we are with TCA, putting our brand behind TCA, we've already seen some new players, some new entrants coming in at levels that TCA historically wouldn't participate, right, so call it in the hundreds of millions of dollars rather than the tens to a hundred million in terms of players.","A lot of that has to do with the ability to participate on referral networks, right, and actually help us work with our clients better and maintain those relationships and bringing custody of some of the RIA platforms onto the TCA platforms so that they can participate in the referral networks that we're driving. So we do anticipate to see additional asset growth and additional assets coming on board through the TCA channel. On the Corporate Services side, the real differentiator this quarter, and it's different for every company, this quarter, we were actually with the customer who we onboarded, one of the big corporates. We're able to break down the walls that used to be there around vested equity. And so a lot of times, when stock plan participants had vested equity at the old stock plan provider, that's in their brokerage account at that stock plan provider. And those were held on to buy that broker. With this turn, we were able to unleash those $4.5 billion long vested equity shares and bring them on board at E*TRADE.","So they do sit in a broker account. They are new assets. We just don't count them in our net new because we're extremely conservative on that. We always have been. And we're not trying to add those on top of our growth goals for the asset side. Just merely pointing out that, that's yet another channel that we're using to drive asset growth here at E*TRADE. So all in all, I couldn't be more pleased with the progress we've made. I think the growth goals did exactly what they were supposed to do for this franchise, and we'll continue to drive that with our investing advice continuum, which we'll roll out big-time marketing during the summer and then into the fall. And we have had some early success in that place, and we'll continue to do so. So lots of growth yet to be driven, Rich.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.","Devin Ryan","I guess, first question here, derivatives DARTs, they're not bumping into that 35% target, and I know it can move around from month-to-month. But should we read that metric as the penetration and maybe the synergy from OptionsHouse has now been achieved and so the opportunity is more mature? Or could we actually think about that target moving higher at some point here if there's more work to do?","Karl Roessner","So I hope that you're getting to, should I get a feel for the management team that's in place here. We're not a team that gets satisfied very easily. So that 34%, calling it bumping up against 35%, when you sort of discount back to just the massive equity volumes that we've experienced as we've tried to hit this goal, there's a lot more to deliver from the OptionsHouse platform. We've been rolling out new tools and new services for that customer base. We're very pleased with the number of new entrants to E*TRADE trading options and other derivatives on our platform. The Power E*TRADE offering has been quite a success. You actually see some of that in the pull-down on the CPT that we have, because there's just more adopters and more folks trading more with us. So a lot more to come from the OptionsHouse side from E*TRADE as a whole in the derivatives space. It's an area that we intend to own, Devin.","Devin Ryan","Okay. And then just a follow-up here. So on the commission rate, I appreciate the color for the balance of the year. And also, I do appreciate all the detail you guys gave on some of the differentiated tools that you've been rolling out. And so I'm just trying to think about, looking beyond this year, there haven't been any advertised price cuts well over a year, but industry profitability is at high levels. There's obviously some aggressive promotions out there. You have your Robinhood moving into kind of arguably some more Active Trading products, it's your commission. So I know it's difficult to predict what competitor behavior may be, but what are you planning for as you look out beyond, call it, this year on pricing and on, I guess, kind of the trajectory of commissions? And how does that factor into the conversation just heading into October?","Karl Roessner","Look, for us, Devin, it's more about value, right? What's the value proposition that E*TRADE is driving? It's why we've been so powerfully behind the Power E*TRADE program and what we can deliver for traders who come to us at $4.95, if they trade 30x a quarter and they get $0.50 on the options contract. So we've looked at our business model. We think the value that we bring to the table for the individuals who use our services is extreme. We think we're at the high end in terms of what we provide in return for what they pay to us. Zero commission, zero trading, zero everything has been out there for quite some time. We don't see those destinations as eight caps away from us. We know that there is a market for a new entrant who wants to come in and try it out and see what it's all about. But when you pick up the phone and you don't get to talk to a human being on the other side, that's a pretty powerful telltale sign of things just aren't working right, right? So we think the value, we deliver it where we are. So I don't intend to be and we don't intend to be a first-mover in the commissions space. And quite honestly, we think the value being provided for our customers at this point in time is right on the money.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier","Karl, maybe just one more on the Corporate Services business. You talked about a lot. You guys have good momentum there. Just trying to understand, like, when you look at the business today, like, how much maybe contribution is there to, like, the earnings, the profitability? And then if it's successful over time in terms of kind of converting those customers and you're doing more with them, like, what is the -- maybe the upside potential in over multiple years?","Karl Roessner","Yes. I mean, the upside potential -- and Corporate Services in an interesting business, and it's a fantastic differentiator for us, right? It drives assets and accounts. I don't look at the Corporate Services business as something that, in and of itself, in the contracting stage, the licensing stage, sort of the early corporate relationship. That's not something that we ever intend to use as a profit leader for us who's trying to drive additional value. What we like there the most is the relationship that we form with the large corporate and the opportunity to get onto the campus and speak to employees about how we can help them with their financial needs, right? That's something that is very powerful if you can be a first-mover into the campus and let them know that E*TRADE is here for them. And if they're looking for an investment adviser or they want to move out away from that and talk to somebody who can actually manage their newfound shares or new wealth tier, we'll have an RIA who sits on the TCA custody platform. If you want a simple robo, if you want a simple pot of ETFs that you can put your money into, we have those as well. So the more powerful side for Corporate Services for me is the asset gathering as end, in addition, the new clients coming onto E*TRADE. Historically, there's been about a 15% keep of the assets that come through us on a year basis as they vest and flow through those accounts. We believe that with the addition of TCA and the RIA population, with the revamp of our investing advice continuum, as we've talked about quite a bit, with the way that we are now approaching that business from early on talking to people about the value that E*TRADE can drive through education, through more meaningful interaction with those stock plan participants, that this will be a big value driver for us go forward.","Michael Carrier","And then just quick follow-up. On one of the last questions, you just mentioned on asset gathering that the returns bringing in assets, I think you said, are maybe 2 to 3x that of peers. And I was just curious, like, what do you think or how are you driving that difference?","Michael Pizzi","Yes, I mean, the calculation, if you just do the revenue yield on a client asset, so take total revenue over client assets as you look through the kind of the peer group. First, the largest players of the industry were almost 3x versus kind of our closer competitors in that sort of 2x range, and it just shows the profitability of a pure retail franchise away from the larger institutional books.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler","I just wanted to start with the Premium Savings Account launch, the one with the 1.5% rate. Is the objective here really to expand your overall client base and increase net new asset growth? Or is it really across the opportunity for your existing client base? And also, how do you think about the risk that it could partly cannibalize your existing cash sweep by increasing the beta?","Michael Pizzi","Yes. I mean, it is primarily, at this point, targeted to keep money that would be flowing into other banks. As customers are sitting on larger cash balances, they may not be ready to reinvest those, given kind of where the market's at, kind of -- or how the market's been performing. They may be looking to put some of that cash into a savings-type product. We've seen some of those flows. It is to capture that share and keep it in-house and earn a pretty reasonable return on it and keep it within E*TRADE, don't allow that customer to form a relationship with another financial services provider. Many of whom could offer brokerage services. In that sense, it's kind of hard to say if it was money that was going to leave, and it's staying in-house. It's hard to stay with that cannibalization in terms of we're cannibalizing our own -- we're taking a sweep that would have stayed in a sweep. So it's a little bit difficult to calculate kind of what a cannibalization estimate or what you're really causing with it. But we're really capturing money in that product, and I think that, that's kind of how we want to position the product at this time. We don't really want to be a rate leader on it, but we want to pay a competitive rate for savings and use the convenience of keeping your money in 1 application, 1 provider and easily move it back to your brokerage account when you want to.","Craig Siegenthaler","And just a follow-up here on expenses. Can you help us think about the right run rate for advertising, just given seasonality and the dip this quarter?","Michael Pizzi","The dip is really -- the runoff of kind of the higher spending in Q1, the biggest quarter will always be Q1. Obviously, this year, we had a Super Bowl ad. While we still have some things going on with the World Cup and U.S. Open, it's not quite at the rate we're pacing than it was in Q1. That will be extending, really, Q3, but I think we're kind of in the range and kind of what the right run rate's ought to be as we kind of move through the rest of the year, getting towards that 200 total that we talked about.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Daniel Fannon","I guess, just as you think about the growth, Karl, that you outlined across your business and you think about your scale and the products you have, do you think additional M&A is needed at this point? Or is it all kind of more organic-based than some of the things you've been investing in?","Karl Roessner","So the position that we've taken on M&A remains fairly constant when we talked about this over the past couple of quarters. We're really focused on anything that could add additional value, like the scope or scale or sort of product gaps to our retail customers. And then could we have scale in our Corporate Services business, right? Is there another way to go out and acquire some additional Corporate Services clients just to grow that high of possible value for us? So the M&A activity remains at the same level, right? We'll always use the same capital lens to look at anything we're going to acquire. There's nothing out there that's a pressing need for us at the moment. So most of the growth that I talked about, like all the growth I talked about right now on this call is organic. So -- but if something were to come along that was a product extension or was something that the sales reps or the service reps in the field tell us we're missing and if we can buy it quicker and cheaper than we can build it, we'll definitely run that through the capital lens and determine whether or not we should go after it.","Daniel Fannon","Got it. And then just in terms of the TCA business and the outlook, can you talk about the organic growth there a little bit more? Do you have like a backlog of RIAs that you're looking to attract to the platform? It does seem -- obviously, you talked about the Corporate Services and some of the cross-selling and integration. But just in terms of the growth of that business as a stand-alone platform, can you talk about the initiatives there?","Karl Roessner","Yes. So on the TCA side, we've just started to put our brand behind it. And I can tell you that within the couple of weeks after we closed the transaction, there was an uptick of a couple of hundred million of RIAs -- of, sorry, RIA assets that we're committed to come onto the platform. So we've seen some early success. We do have a number of RIAs who are very interested in working with us as we put together the referral program, because, obviously, that's a new source of business for them. In order to do that, they need to be custodied on TCA's platform. So there are lots of conversations going on right now. I am extremely pleased with sort of the early days results and the backlog that I see just in terms of some of the names of the RIAs who are interested and looking at E*TRADE as a new opportunity for them. And the way to us is through TCA. So I think it's a very nice story in terms of putting our brand behind TCA on the first instance because their platform is just -- I think it's a phenomenal platform, very easy to use, easy to rebalance for the advisers. And all the advisers I've talked to like it quite a bit. And so putting the brand and helping them grow organically and then also being able to introduce them to a number of RIAs who are very interested in working with E*TRADE's client base.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Campbell with Barclays.","Jeremy Campbell","So while the dollar value has been pretty flat this year, client cash balances obviously keep driving down, and they've kind of come down every single month since February, just like the choppy markets. I guess, when you think about new -- net new assets here, how much of that is coming from clients new to E*TRADE? And what do those client cash allocations look like? Are they lowering, yielding some blended, kind of remixing for the overall book? Or is the decrease really in client cash and more from existing clients continuing to take down allocations and invest in areas like Fang like you mentioned earlier?","Michael Pizzi","Yes, I mean, if you look at sort of the net new asset level versus the net buy level, you can kind of see what's going on. It's not so much that the new accounts coming on have less cash or an x dragging you down the average, it's really that existing account that had a higher percentage of cash are just moving in the market. And you see it -- you see that behavior kind of going right through 0, right, because the margin book continues to grow as well, so customers even getting more comfortable borrowing. We see new entrants into the margin book, the number of users growing overall. So it's -- we're holding flat because we're growing the number of accounts. We're getting some cash from the Corporate Services business. We added TCA. We're holding that cash balance against really record engagement and record net buying.","Jeremy Campbell","Got it, got it. And then just one point of clarification, Mike. In your prepared remarks, I think you mentioned that the blended deposit rates, including customer payables, are -- you said they approached 20 basis points in 3Q from 9 in 2Q. Then I think separately, you mentioned the expectation for 20% deposit betas. I just wanted to clarify that the 20% betas are for future rate hikes off of the new base after you kind of reset to the 20-basis point expectation. Is that correct?","Michael Pizzi","That's correct, yes. And the rates we're giving you is the sort of expense in the period. The beta obviously would occur around the time of the rate hikes. Sometimes there's a little delay, depending on processing time, to put the rate change into effect. So it would occur on kind of the date of the rate change or sometime thereafter when the system is updated.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW.","Kyle Voigt","Just a question. Just in terms of the third quarter call, I just want to see if we can get a bit more clarity as to what exactly investors should expect on that call regarding the results of the strategic review. Just wondering, is it something going to be the end decision by the board? Or is it fair to think that we'll get a breakdown of the board's and the third-party's analysis of the company's value under these varying strategic scenarios? And then, I guess, part two of that question, you've spoken in the past about quantitative and qualitative factors that are going to be considered by the board. I was wondering if you can maybe elaborate on some of those qualitative factors and the influence that those factors will have in the review process.","Karl Roessner","Okay. So that's a mouthful. So let me just step back. The way that we've set up this process is not dissimilar to what we've done in years past in terms of the board being very interested in how this management team and prior management teams, for that matter, will continue to drive value for our shareholders, right? At the crux of all of this, the growth goals, the reports that we have, the things that we put on the wall here to make sure that our entire team from top to bottom is aligned to those growth goals, that's all of the view toward driving shareholder value.","So the results that we will come to this group with and sort of talk about on the October call, I would expect that we will go through where we are on the four growth metrics that we put out there. But remember that those growth -- the growth goals we put out were really client business metrics. They didn't really get into the value drivers of the franchise or what we can continue to deliver going forward for our shareholders, right? What are we doing from more of a business operating results perspective? We picked 4 very specific categories to prove to ourselves that we could reignite the growth engines at E*TRADE. I think we've done just that. So the October call, I would expect that we will have quite a dialogue around what the board has looked at, how pleased they are with what we've done and what they expect from us on a go-forward basis. In terms of getting into it any further, they haven't had the meeting yet. They haven't been through anything with anyone else. With the management team, we haven't presented to them yet. So I really can't go into any other additional details. Unfortunately, we'll have to wait until October.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Let me just go back to the stock plan business and the economics of that. Obviously, I appreciate your comments, Karl, about -- on how that can see the relationship, and you've historically kept 15%. Can you talk about what you view as sort of the breakeven retention for that business in terms of the cost that you have to put into processing that? And to what extent would you like to see that 15% move up to coming very close to your, say, corporate margin? Or is that possible?","Karl Roessner","So I'm going to ask Mike Pizzi to take the first part of your question, but I will hit the second part of your question first. Driving that 15% on a sort of annual basis, looking back as far as I can say, and that spikes up and down, depending on the client and depending on the type of engagement that we've had. So it's sort of in that ballpark. But driving that level of engagement up a few percentage points on the size of the asset pool that we now have collected from corporate clients with the new pipeline, with the implementations that we just had, that's extremely valuable to us. So converting those stock plan customers into E*TRADE clients or maintaining their assets on our custody platform through TCA is a big value driver for us. And I'm not going to size it or scope it for you, but I will tell you that driving that number up a few percentage points is extremely meaningful to our results. Mike, do you want to talk about the first part?","Michael Pizzi","Yes, I mean, on the retention side, we have excellent retention of the end corporate relationships. While we may lose one here or there, it is typically almost always the result of M&A activity where we lose -- stock plan that the company was acquired, and we lose it to the acquired entity stock plan. From a retention standpoint, we never gave the retention of those relationships within that business, but we do exceptionally well at serving those clients and making sure we are providing that end corporate customer's needs. And that gives us an excellent base now. As companies continue to push equity comp further down, that drives additional growth. As the companies themselves grow in market cap and asset value, that obviously drives additional growth. And then we're driving levels of growth on top of that by adding new plan assets.","Karl Roessner","And just to sort of drive it home, breaking out results or talking about sort of the Corporate Services, or E*TRADE Corporate Services as we call it, as a separate line, I don't look at it that way, right? This is a phenomenal feeder channel for us, and we'll continue to invest in this business. I mean, some of the headcount or expense that we had was adding the right people and making sure that we had the right individuals as we onboarded some of the larger clients that are coming through the pipeline. And we'll continue to do that, right? It's not going to impact our operating margin. We find the moneys and the expense, costs from elsewhere in the organization and we'll redeploy it. So this business, as long as they continue to drive corporate relationships, we'll absolutely invest in it. And then it's up to the brokerage business to take the handoff and drive additional value from that customer set.","Brian Bedell","Great. That's a helpful explanation. And then maybe just the last one. Just to go back to the board's valuation process for these third-parties' valuation processes. Since they think about the value of E*TRADE as an independent company, is it your sense that the third party and the board would look at forward macro conditions in terms of normalizing those on a long-term go-forward basis, like a TCF type of analysis or rather view the fact that we're in a late stage -- very late stage of an economic and boom market cycle and the likelihood of competitor pressures and commission cuts over the next 2 or 3 years and with that more likely factoring their decision?","Karl Roessner","So I appreciate everything that you just went through, and I understand what you're trying to drive at. The only answer I have on that question is this board, right, of which I'm a member and sort of a management member, is extremely well informed, right? They take data points from everywhere. They look at what we've done. They hold management accountable in a big way, right? We know what we need to deliver. We know what we'll bring forward to the board. They will do their analysis and their homework. They will look to an investment bank to help them go through some of this. And in October, we'll talk to you about where we are.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Just a couple quick ones here. Aside from marketing, given the no revenue share policy for Vanguard, what's the -- is there any other benefit beyond the marketing side in offering those ETFs commission free?","Karl Roessner","So, look, there's a big value to our customers, right? We've listened, we've heard what they've said. We see a lot of activity in those funds. And if we can offer them for free and we can put that out there and satisfy a need that they may go elsewhere to satisfy, we're absolutely going to do that, right? So this one is about just being unbiased, independent and listening to what our customers want. And it's something that we pride ourselves on, and we'll continue to do it. So we can call it marketing, we can call it customer relationships. I look at it as a fantastic customer service move and letting them know that we actually care about what they want, and we're putting it on our platform.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. That's fair. And then sort of a minor nitpicky one. But looking at the rhythm, the sort of cadence of the share repurchases in dollars, it looks pretty steady, aside from 1Q. Is that a programmatic, this one that you got in place? Or is that one that is subject to discretion?","Michael Pizzi","It's been subject to discretion. We have the ability to put a program in place. So we have used both. But just take our guidance, we said measured pace. That's kind of what we're trying to do. We're generating capital in each period. We look at sort of capital alternatives in terms of what we're using within the balance sheet. That's really the other main use of capital. You can see this period, we had a larger dividend out of the bank simply because the balance sheet growth did not materialize. That gives us a little bit of extra corporate cash to work with. But overall, our intention is to really continue kind of at that measured pace.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.","Michael Cyprys","It sounded like you offer -- you mentioned you offer a higher interest rate for the negotiated book. I'm just curious if you can talk a little bit about that. What's sort of the range in terms of the rate that's offered? And how important is that higher interest rate for that sort of customer set? And maybe you can talk about how that's kind of evolved over time, maybe prior cycles, how important it was then?","Michael Pizzi","Yes, it's a really small customer set. In terms of like -- when you look at sort of negotiations, the number of sort of like margin rate negotiations we see or commission rate attempts are much higher. These are -- this is still the lowest and smallest area of overall negotiations that we're doing. In terms of products, we have a number of products. If they're just looking for a savings product because they don't want to be in the market right now, we have the Premium Savings Account. If it's really a cash sweep portion, we have multiple products at multiple levels. We look at the profitability of the relationship. We look at the activity. We look at what they do with us in terms of -- in determining what we're going to offer.","Michael Cyprys","Okay. And just as a follow-up question. Just curious how you're thinking about some of the disruptors in the industry like Robinhood and Coinbase. Those guys have captured millions and millions of customers. Just curious how you're thinking about extending your brand and products that -- to capture some of that growth. And where might E*TRADE be able to act as a disruptor in the industry over the next couple of years?","Karl Roessner","So it's a great question. So thank you for that, Michael. The way that I look at this and the way that our whole company looks at this, we were the original, right, the original place to invest online. Our brand absolutely extends and is welcomed by that customer set, right? It's about looking at our digital offering and making sure that it is extremely easy to interact with, things are easy to find, you get things like our new ETF offerings where it's 2 clicks to invest your dollars and come to E*TRADE. So for us, it's about getting back to our roots. I do not look at them as a primary competitor or other things. They have some great technology, they've made a nice splash, they've announced some large customer levels from what I can see. We have a lot of customers, too, right? And our customers are loyal to us. We continue to deliver quality products to them. We have a right to be in that space, and you should full well and expect that in 2019, we'll absolutely be playing in that space.","Operator","We have no further questions.","Karl Roessner","All right. Great. With that, I bid you all a good night, and we'll talk to you in October, I'm sure. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call.

No other recordings or copies of the call are authorized or may be relied upon.","With that, I would now turn the call over to Mr. Roessner.","Karl Roessner","Thanks, Christopher. Good evening, and thank you for joining on our third quarter call. In September of 2016, we began a new journey at E*TRADE, a journey defined by a call to accelerate growth and to return to our roots as the undisputed leader for digitally-inclined traders and investors. Over the course of the last two years, we have made exceptional progress on this journey and we've created enormous value for our shareholders along the way. We've truly positioned the company for continued success and for sustainable long-term value creation.","On behalf of E*TRADE\u2019s leadership team, I look forward to expanding on these statements in more detail but will begin with an overview of tonight\u2019s call. First, our Executive Chairman, Rodger Lawson will walk you through the board\u2019s assessment of our performance and the impact of that assessment on the company\u2019s future. Next, I will provide my thoughts on our progress and my team\u2019s vision for the future of E*TRADE. Finally, Mike Pizzi will follow with an update on our capital allocation plans and summarize our Q3 results. Then, we will commence our customary Q&A. ","In addition for earnings press release, we have included supplementary pages in our investor presentation which highlights several of the key elements we will cover on the call this evening. It has been a very exciting and fulfilling two years and it is a pleasure to turn the page on this chapter in such a positive fashion and I look forward to sharing our vision for the future.","With that, I will hand the call over to our Executive Chairman, Rodger Lawson.","Rodger Lawson","Thank you, Karl, and good evening everyone. In the autumn of 2016, having announced the acquisition of OptionsHouse, the board set out a series of business driver relationship performance goals to serve as proof that we could reinvigorate growth, improve operating leverage and install a deeper sense of urgency in our ranks. As a board, we want the confirmation that E*TRADE had a bonafide long-term growth trajectory and could keep delivering meaningful value for our shareholders over time.","As many of you know we also expressed if we couldn't achieve those goals over a reasonable period of time which we outlined as 18 to 24 months, we would consider other strategic options to protect and enhance shareholder value including a merger or even a sale of the company. Two years on, the company has clearly reinvigorated its growth and delivered outstanding returns. While the specific driver goals we set represent only one aspect of the company's strong performance, we are pleased with having outperformed on three of the four benchmarks we laid out.","The area where we've fallen short is net new asset growth which has certainly improved but has lagged initial targets. We do recognize have of the shortfall is substantially due to our historical lack of institutional custody capability. Our acquisition and successful integration of TCA is quickly addressing some of that legacy gap, and Karl will tell more about why we are so optimistic about that opportunity.","During the two-year period the board is evaluated E*TRADE not only against the full 2016 growth goals which has served as a guy posts of managing top line growth but also against other important dimensions of performance including earnings growth, ROE expansion and shareholder value creation all of which have exceeded our expectations.","Here are a few of the comments we've noted during this period. The company has meaningfully elevated its offerings for derivative engaged traders above and beyond the capabilities we acquired with OptionsHouse. This has attracted more profitable trading activity and created a more resilient user base. We have seen the company's ability to grow and stock plan channel with a record increase and a number of new client wins. This is a critical growth engine for us as we look to our future.","The team's successful integrated two acquisitions which is significantly expanded our capabilities on reach both for the present but also for the future.","Management has consistently demonstrated an ability to quickly react to a very competitive market landscape while still expanding our share across our most profitable segments. There has also been great focus on operating discipline as well as revenue growth both of which are reflected in the expansion of E*TRADE\u2019s operating margin.","Overall, therefore, while looking broadly across E*TRADE or the specific business driver goals, the board is very pleased with the evolution and progress of the company over the past few years. It\u2019s really been terrific. We're also very pleased with the total shareholder returns over that period during which we have significantly outpaced the performance of the market, the sector and our direct peers.","We have also been very focused not just on the past but also growth prospects for the future. We believe this is critical to selecting the best path forward for E*TRADE and its shareholders. In looking at our future prospects, we have considered and placed substantial weight on the following areas: first, management's long-term strategic plan. The board's assessment of this multi-year plan is it's positive and not unreasonably optimistic, it is a sound incredible plan and should generate material value growth for E*TRADE.","Second, the Board believes, after receiving analysis and advice from our third-party advisors, that with good execution management's plan, there is material shareholder value upside in E*TRADE\u2019s future which is more compelling than what we believe will be generated from any likely near-term transaction. Critical elements in the assessment of management\u2019s multi-year plan is follows.","First, with approximately 6 million accounts and approaching a half a trillion in assets, the company has built significant scale across our areas of business. Beyond the current value profile of this base of customers and assets, we see meaningful potential to expand our products and, therefore, our engagements across this group which can drive substantial increase in value with just modest improvements. With the pending acquisition of roughly one million accounts from Cap One, this potential will only expand.","E*TRADE\u2019s position in our core trading segment has improved materially and as a result we believe we will continue to participate proportionately in any growth of trading activity in the U.S. We are confident with these growth expectations even considering the potential for future price competition for other industry players.","As part of that perspective as we look out over the five-year time horizon, we do not expect the trading tree to grow to the sky and we do recognize the markets can go down as well as up. Additionally, we have significant confidence that we will continue to involve Evolve and grow our presence in the stock plan business. Our capabilities in market share under E*TRADE corporate services remain industry leading and we have every intention of maintaining that status. Karl and Mike will share more light in the importance of and contribution made by this business in their prepared comments in a moment. ","Further, we believe the acquisition of TCA provides a sound foundation to influence our growth rates both because of the quality of the custodial platform as well as our ability to expand relative to our existing total asset base. We expect the nature of our business model evolve over the next few years as we enhance our capabilities in wealth management both directly and indirectly.","When taken with the opportunity to expand the services we offer through transactional banking services like security space lending, savings offerings and digital payment solutions, we expect the Evolve suite of E*TRADE\u2019s offerings to be extremely competitive. ","We also believe that our progress in the RIA space, robot advisory money management will enable us to increase our retention rate on corporate services proceeds which has been stable around 15% for some time. We think the historical absence of clear investment choices of plan participants whether self-directed or advised has restricted our ability to retain more corporate services assets and the broadening of our capabilities will allow us to engage more deeply with these customers.","Last but by no means the least, we're obviously pleased with the E*TRADE\u2019s ability both currently and prospectively to generate excess capital. As the board and the management team it will be our intention to continue to return that capital to our shareholders. Simply put, if we can\u2019t use it, we will not sit on it. We've already demonstrated our commitment to return capital to shareholders by our prior stock buybacks, and today Karl and Mike will let our forthcoming Capital Management and return plans.","With the confidence we've taken from our assessment of the company's future growth plans as well as the quality of management's execution, the board's expectations for E*TRADE's future grow are high. During our five-year planning horizon, we expect to see mid-teens growth at earnings per share aided in part by an expansion of our operating margin and also return on equity of 20% or better.","With this performance expectation the board's current view, therefore, is that we do not believe initiating a sale process is the best path for value creation for our shareholders. I would, however, add the following comments. First, we have no illusions of what our producer responsibilities are when it comes to assessing the performance on prospects with the company we got them and the options that may be available to us over the course of time. The board will not waver in seeking any steps to protect value for our shareholders. As I said in the past, we want to grow shareholder value, not lose it. ","And second we remain conscious of the fact that as a smallest player in a highly competitive environment we have little wiggle room for failure. We don't see that situation changing. We must, for the foreseeable future, continue to deliver an outsized impact through an unyielding focus and efficient execution. ","Finally as we look to the future there are of course many material metrics which are relevant to us and I have little doubt will be focused on them more, however, over a five year planning horizon the board will be most focused on EPS growth as well as ROE expansion as our major common denominator metrics to assess whether we are succeeding or not.","With that, I'll pass the commentary back to Karl.","Karl Roessner","Thank you, Rodger. It\u2019s been a long road and I'm incredibly proud of our team. We revitalized our product set, we put our brand back on the map, we reclaimed our mantle as the home for active traders, and we worked tirelessly to make sure that our foundation from our risk framework to our operations and technology capabilities is sound. Over the past 24 months we have delivered meaningful financial growth including over 20% compound annual growth in revenues, up 30% CAGR in earnings per share, and a remarkable 40% annualized growth in adjusted pretax income.","We grow our balance sheet by 32%, expanded our adjusted operating margin by 1100 basis points, and improved our ROE by 900 basis points while returning over $1 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases. We accomplished this by delivering exceptional business growth and integrating a meaningful acquisition in OptionsHouse which together allowed us to capitalize on a favorable market environment.","We're also setting ourselves up for the future with the closing of TCA in April and the upcoming acquisition of nearly a million accounts from Capital One which is on track to close in the fourth quarter. To this end, we have improved our trailing 12-month DARTs to more than 260,000, up 73% from the pace of 24 months to go driven by a greater number of accounts and an increase in activity per account which grew from 12 to 18 trades. We more than doubled our derivatives DARTs from 38,000 in Q3 '16 to 86,000 in this most recent quarter.","We improved our organic net new brokerage assets from $9 billion to more than $14 billion during the trailing 12-month period. We more than doubled our pace of account growth from 88,000 in the 12 months ended in September 2016 to 215,000 over the past 12 months and we grew our highest value accounts at more than double the rate of our total account growth. We've attracted net flows of 51% on our Q3 2016 managed asset balance scaling from $3.7 billion to more than $6 billion. We enjoyed the success of a low base which gives us confidence in our ability to continue scaling managed assets over time given our improved capabilities to serve long term investors. We onboarded more than $26 billion of new corporate services stock plan assets from new client since Q3 of '16. This is more than double the amount we brought in over the preceding 24-month period. We added 135 billion in gross new assets from existing corporate services clients.","None of this could have happened without a tremendous team effort. Over the last two years we acquired OptionsHouse and successfully integrated it within our platform with earning synergies this year running approximately $0.10 per share higher than what we originally communicated. We acquired TCA. We launched Power E*TRADE. We reinvigorated our brand with an irreverent new advertising campaign. We significantly upgraded our website and enhanced our active trading suite with truly differentiated enhancements. We were rated the number one mobile trading options trading and web-based platform in the most recent stockbrokers.com survey.","We achieved the number one loyalty and overall satisfaction rating for our stock plan platform Equity Edge Online for the seventh straight year. We deftly responded to competitive pricing by setting up the tier offering thereby retaining our most valuable active customers.","We reinforced our best-in-class risk organization and continued improving the company's overall risk profile allowing us to reduce our bank and consolidated capital threshold by 100 basis points and 50 basis points respectively freeing up approximately $700 million in capital.","We refinanced over $1.4 billion of debt in TRUPs yielding annual savings of approximately $20 million. We exhibited notable expense discipline confining expense increases to under half of our revenue growth and this represents only a partial list of our accomplishments. ","As most of you are aware, I never tire of discussing our corporate services stock plan channel, which is a real differentiator for our franchise. In addition to being a tremendous feeder channel of accounts and assets, the cash profile of our corporate services related customers is significantly better than that of our other customers and thus delivers an outsized contribution to net interest income and to earnings.","Over the last two years, corporate services related assets have grown by 30% more than assets in other retail accounts and as of the end of the third quarter, corporate services related cash contributed 35% of all customer cash balances. As most of you understand, our corporate services channel serves as a funnel to our broader brokerage business as stock grants turn into vested shares which translate to cash proceeds as well as to engagement with our broader suite of offering. ","Due to the extraordinary success of our corporate services team, the volume of assets that has entered that funnel has never been greater than it is today. If we consider the sum of the unvested unexercised and vested but yet to be transacted stock plan shares, the opportunity set of stock plan asset has increased from approximately $150 billion in Q3 of 2016 to $260 billion today. Not only do we expect a future net new asset flows but it should disproportionately contribute to growth in cash deposits.","Finally, with the addition of institutional custody services in concert with our focus on delivering an exceptionally easy to use digital wealth offering, we believe the opportunity to engage more deeply with these stock plan customers will expand significantly. Needless to say as we endeavor to retain more proceeds each percentage point increase on a $260 billion base contributes meaningfully to net new assets.","While we're incredibly proud of our accomplishments, we're not resting on past results and we're exceedingly focused on adapting our model to position E*TRADE to where the market is headed. The self-directed trader will always be core to our strategy and we will continue to deliver exceptional product and a truly differentiated service experience for our most discerning and engaged customers. With that said, we must focus our energy on competing more effectively in the digital wealth space. And we've also been hard of work building on our capabilities to serve a range of investor needs including meaningfully expanding our list of no transaction fee mutual funds and ETFs, enhancing our financial consultant powered offerings for those clients who continue to prioritize human touch and relaunching our best-in-class robot solution, our core portfolios.","These new capabilities have enabled us to surpass our $6 billion managed assets goal without material advertising focus. We know that this will be the fastest growing segment of the wealth management market and we fully intend to align the power of our brand and our capabilities against this opportunity as this segment of the market continues to take flight.","By incorporating TCA by E*TRADE, we're expanding our footprint to the RIA segment which will broaden our addressable market and serve as a critical retention tool for brokerage and stock plan accounts in search of higher touch services. While this edition provides a foothold in a new market plugging it into E*TRADE makes the platform considerably stronger. Adding the E*TRADE moniker to the platform is already bearing fruit, adding $1 billion in custodial assets since April. We see this as an added tool for our financial consultants and meeting our clients investing needs while also creating meaningful opportunities for the RIA\u2019s that we add to the program.","In that vein, we are thrilled to announce the addition of Edelman Financial Services, an industry stalwart to our platform and aim to connect their advisors to our national referral program launching in the coming weeks. Through this arrangement client assets from one of the preeminent advisors in the country will be custodied with E*TRADE while our referral network will provide E*TRADE\u2019s financial consultants with the channel to connect clients in need of higher touch services with RIAs on our platform.","Since we announced the acquisition a year ago, TCA has more than 12 billion in commitments and we are only just getting started. Just to contextualize that number at the time, we announced the acquisition TCA had $17 billion in assets under custody, so it should go without saying that this growth engine has been ignited in a very real way.","With the solid foundation, we look forward to delivering on concrete financial objectives. First, we are targeting sustainable mid-teens EPS growth for the next five years amounting to an approximate doubling of our earnings power by 2023. Second, we plan to expand our operating margin from its current 48% level to 50% in 2020 and drive toward a mid-50s level by 2023. Third, we look to expand our ROE from the current level of approximately 16% to beyond 20% and, fourth, we plan to achieve these targets while also returning meaningful capital to shareholders via dividends and buybacks beginning immediately with another $1 billion repurchase program and our initiation of a 14% quarterly dividend. Mr. Pizzi will provide additional details on our capital plan.","Before I turn the call over to Mike, I want to congratulate him on his recent promotion and the expansion of his role to include the COO title. Mike is an E*TRADE success story progressing during his 15-year tenure from portfolio management to Bank Treasurer to Corporate Treasurer to Chief Risk Officer and more recently to Chief Financial Officer. This elevated role is a natural extension of Mike\u2019s position and I am confident it will result in great things for this organization and for our shareholders. ","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Pizzi.","Michael Pizzi","Thanks Karl. It\u2019s been incredibly fulfilling to build my career at E*TRADE and it\u2019s a privilege to help lead this great company into the future. Now let me begin by discussing our growth objectives in more detail and then I will lay out our capital priorities and then briefly cover Q3 results. First on our growth objectives. We are advancing from a set of goals that were narrowly defined by business metrics to broader financial targets such as earnings growth, return on equity and capital allocation which are more directly aligned to delivering value for shareholders. To meet these financial targets, we must flexibly react to the competitive and economic environment and pull on different levers to deliver earnings growth.","With that as a context, I would like to dive into the targets that Rodger and Karl set out. First, we plan to maintain an operating margin above 50% which we expect to reach by 2020; in a stable environment, we expect to expand this to mid-50 level by 2023. Over the last several years, we have grounded our budgeting in an operating margin framework that transparently commits to balanced top-line growth with expense discipline.","This framework ensures that we are judicious on expense growth in favorable market environments and that we are disciplined on spending during more challenging revenue periods. Under this framework, we anticipate growing revenues to 350 to 400 basis points faster than expenses which should lead to the steady and sustainable margin expansion.","Next, we are targeting mid-teens EPS growth or more than doubling of our EPS to a greater than $7 by 2023. Our target for earnings growth is not based on blind optimism, we anticipate achieving double-digit growth in pre-tax income with approximately two-thirds coming from revenue growth and one-third from margin expansion. We also plan to continue repurchasing our stock which will contribute to our EPS growth over the five-year period. In terms of the inputs underlying this multi-year plan, we assume a few more Fed rate hikes including two in 2019 and one the following year.","We assume continued strong engagement by our customers but expect a far more moderate pace of DART and margin growth compared to the rapid expansion we saw this year. Our model assumes that brokerage cash levels remain relatively in line with the current rate of approximately 13% of brokerage customer assets; should cash levels moderate back in historical norms higher than 15%, we also expect a commensurate softening of DART activity and customer margin growth.","Finally, our model assumes modest contraction within commission per trade as competitive trends point to continued pricing pressure by others in the industry. This should be partially offset by a greater share of derivative trading on our platform. ","The earnings growth modeled in our plan and the drivers I just covered are presented on Slide 34 of the investor presentation. The earnings improvement in our plan comes primarily from consistent sweep deposit growth among our core brokerage and stock plan customers and from the tremendous scale benefits, we realize on each new incremental dollar of revenue. We believe it is prudent to exercise conservatism on our modeling and, therefore, assign relatively modest growth the sum of our emerging platforms. That does not diminish our optimism about the potential in these areas or our excitement about the strong foundations we have in place. From our digital wealth offerings to our institutional cost these services we have truly differentiated solutions that will be deepen engagement, improve retention and expand the wallet share among our existing brokerage and stock plan customers.","Through these growth vectors we also see substantial opportunity to broaden our reach into new households. Success on these fronts could drive meaningful upside to the greater than $7 EPS target we laid out today. ","As for capital plans our business generates tremendous excess capital that creates capacity to balance for reinvestment in the business with distribution to shareholders. Over the last two years we have the unique opportunity to onboard nearly $9 billion in off-balance sheet deposits which caused us to retain capital. Despite the growth in our capital base, we recently completed our $1 billion repurchase authorization more than three months ahead of plan. We expect to generate even more excess capital going forward given our earnings run rate is considerably higher than a couple of years ago and that the on boarding of the third party deposits is now complete. ","With that backdrop any consideration of the relative cheapness of our shares we will be opportunistic in the pacing of our new $1 billion share buyback program with the ability to complete up to half during the fourth quarter of this year. We intend to complete the program by the end of 2019. ","With respect to the initiation of a dividend to common shareholders we are launching a payment of $0.14 payable on November 15. While we anticipate our capital allocation will remain skewed towards share buybacks given that they afford tactical flexibility the initiation of the company's first common dividend program running in parallel provides us with ample avenues to efficiently return capital to shareholders.","Taken together, this should speak to not only the quantum of excess capital generation but also as a testament to the predictability and stability of our earnings going forward. We hope and expect this will make E*TRADE a more appealing more appealing to a broader population of investors. ","This capital plan implies a payout in the 80% to 90% range which we believe is appropriate considering our targets for double digit earnings growth. We believe it is sustainable considering our proven capital efficiency and strong operating leverage and we can always pause share repurchases to the extent that we find compelling and organic growth opportunities.","Putting our earnings growth and capital objectives together we plan to expand our ROE from its current 16% level on an adjusted basis to beyond 20% by 2023. An emphasis on ROE demands that we remain disciplined in how we allocate and return capital. We will always be focused on growing earnings but if investments do not enhance shareholder value than we plan to return that capital to its rightful owners, our shareholders. ","Finally, I would like to briefly cover Q3 results. For the quarter, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $261 million or $1 per diluted share on record net revenues of $720 million, up $121 million from the year ago quarter.","We had a couple of unique items which benefited pretax earnings by $30 million including a $34 million benefit to provision for loan losses and $5 million in gains related to the sale of our legacy equity investment in the Chicago Stock Exchange. This was partially offset by a $4 million early extinguishment of debt charge related to the refinancing of our TRUPs and $4 million in restructuring related activities. ","Our effective tax rate for the quarter included an $8 million income tax benefit related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets. This revaluation typically occurs during Q3, and excluding this benefit our tax rate was closer to 26%. We expect the full year 2018 tax rate of approximately 26% and a go forward rate of approximately 27%. ","As for core results, net interest income increased by $13 million as our net interest margin expanded by eight basis points on relatively flat asset balances driven by the impact of the Fed rate hike, higher average margin balances and improved securities portfolio performance. Our average deposit cost including customer payables was 18 basis points in Q3 up from nine basis point last quarter. We expect our blended deposit cost to be 25 basis points in Q4. Following the Fed September rate hike our average rate average reinvestment rate in the securities portfolio is now in the 300 to 325 basis point range similar to the prior quarter.","For the full year 2018, we are forecasting NIM to fall within the range of 305 to 310 basis points assuming customer margin balances remain at current levels. Commission revenue of $117 million increased 17% year-over-year but fell 3% sequentially. DARTs were up modestly but CPT was down $0.27 and there were fewer trading days in the quarter. Our CPT of $7.04 was below our expected range as heighted equity volumes pressured derivative mix and the average number of contracts portrayed and stock plan trade declined. For Q4, we expect commission per trade to fall in the $7 to $7.05 range. These and TRUP service charges were mostly flat quarter-over-quarter. The average yield on third party cash was up five basis points to 143 basis points in Q3; we anticipate generating roughly 150 basis points from third party cash in Q4.","With respect to expenses, non-interest expenses was $380 million, down $4 million from the prior quarter. This quarter is adjusted operating margin which excludes provision benefit and loss on early extinguishment of debt was 48% and improvement of 200 basis points from the prior quarter. We expect our full year 2018 adjusted operating margin to surpass 46% better than the 45% we commented on last quarter's call, given a strong result to date and the benefit of the September rate hike. ","One important update to our expense efforts is the run rate savings we recently achieved on the heels of the $50 billion threshold being lifted with the change of the Dodd-Frank Act. Through some restructuring of our regulatory and enterprise risk management functions to reflect the current regulatory landscape and the improved risk profile of the company we have cut $15 million from our expense base. This savings is embedded in our operating margin assumptions. ","A final note on corporate cash. We ended the quarter at $517 million down $426 million sequentially reflecting the $413 million redemption of TRUPs, the $309 million used to repurchase shares and the $24 million paid on preferred dividends. This was partly offset by $322 million of dividends to the parent from the bank and broker. For Q4, we anticipate approximately $330 million in total dividend to the parent.","And with that, we will open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","And our first question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Chubak","So certainly a lot to unpack here. Wanted to ask, just really dig into the five-year earnings target that you guys outlined and I thought you did a really nice job just speaking to the $7 earnings walk and most of the assumptions there actually look to be quite reasonable, the two that you're maybe referring the most proud here are the modest reduction in commission for trade just given some of the recent developments we've seen on the pricing side, new entrant price wars, et cetera as well as the higher cash level as the percentage of assets and certainly over the last few years we clearly seen that with rising markets and rate that cash levels should continue to grind lower. And just given the long term earnings walk, tell me you can flesh out your long term views on both cash and commission pricing seeing as those who really appear to be the most contentious.","Michael Pizzi","Yes. So let me start on the cash side. Looking at sort of the cash levels now we're down to historic -- a level that we haven't seen since going back well over a decade to a pre-crisis environment roughly 13% or so cash applying assets. Looking at that you know thinking it'll continue to drop from here, we felt that from a planning perspective it best really to hold that flat further cash. Further reductions in cash balances from here will probably mean higher margin balances, higher DART volumes, higher securities lending revenue much of some of the similar to the behavior you seen here today.","Holding it flat then just really gives you the dynamics that we show you in the investor deck that really just has the business generating cash both from the core account growth as well as the corporate services unit which we gave some highlights on it to how that helps us generate cash. When we apply that over the five-year period we get to the cash type balances and balance type levels that are going to drive that earnings power forward that $7 type level.","Karl Roessner","When you look at commissions side I think when we look at our business model and how we've structured ourselves focused on our active trader set, there's a pretty large mix of derivative strays in there, our stock plan administration business and execution to come through that channel, so there's not the situation where we see as zero commission level. We have obviously stressed this and included some of the pricing pressure that we foresee over the near term in the longer term in the plan but that we don't take it down zero just given our business model and given where those fees come from.","Steven Chubak","Got it. That's really helpful. Appreciate responses on both of those items. So this is the follow-up for me it\u2019s going to be on the five-year margin target your earnings walk assumes that it approaches somewhere in the mid-50s, 55% over time. In the past some of your large E-broker competitors that actually talked about a peak margins somewhere closer to 50% simply because competitive pressures make it difficult for profitability to really exceed that threshold and go much beyond that level. Just hoping you could speak to some of the factors you see differentiated in terms of your business mix now actually enable you to operate somewhere above 50% and closer to 55% on a sustained basis.","Michael Pizzi","Yes.","Karl Roessner","That's correct.","Michael Pizzi","And we see it right in kind of a historical performance lifting our sort of operating margin 200 basis points over the past two-year period. We are mainly a digital firm with only 30 branches; it gives us a pretty significant operating leverage base. We focus on using technology smartly to drive that and then sort of the earnings model and how we monetize cash gives us a clear advantage. Without the real estate, with the balance sheet model that we're operating, we think getting to 55% is very realistic.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Christian Bolu","Good afternoon, Rodger, Karl, and Mike. I guess the quick one for Rodger, maybe bit of a blunt question here but to the extent there are meaningful COGS and commissions say by former Fidelity in the near future, does that change at all the board's calculus around to take out?","Rodger Lawson","No, I don't think so. I don't think it makes a material difference in the short-term leading to believe that. I'm not sure personally I believe that but I don't think it makes a material difference, I think there are a number of levers as Mike has alluded to which we pull in that particular process maybe commissions will drop farther but we're getting pretty close to the floor and all this commission rates anyway and the world has changed a great deal and I was joking to say it's tough to fall off the floor when you get to certain lever position in terms of rates.","So actually Christian I don't think it works, I think what would -- the only thing that would affect our perspective is if there were series of license that convinces that we couldn't get to the type of financial performance Mike just described and I think it would that would inform the board's decision, we would think about it differently but at the moment even changes in prices and I alluded to that in my prepared comments, we don't anticipate that's going to make a material difference to our perspective in the foreseeable future.","Christian Bolu","Okay, thank you. So Rodger seems like you're banking quite a lot here on the corporate services business particularly around the amount of cash that comes into that business, I think it's fairly meaningful. We have heard the pitch around increasing retention rates for a while right and you have had TCA and Robots now at least for a couple quarters, should help us understand are you actually seeing an increase in retention rates and can you actually speak to why you think this time is different and we'll see meaningful progress in retention rates over time?","Rodger Lawson","End one is being guilty about talking continuously about upping our retention rates and I seem to remember one of your sell side colleagues said to me that, \"Hey Rodger, you have been talking about since Jesus was a baby.\" And I think in fact just that is the case but I think the dynamic that and I think that was introduced in Karl's comments and Mike's comments is that volume of cash which comes naturally from that corporate services business and even during the last five, six quarters when we all know every one of the industries experienced a lot of money moving into the market, cash levels have come down and I just talked about that.","The cash levels in the corporate services business are even modestly increased or stabilized, so I think corporate services in terms of value chain institution even with a 15% retention rate at the end of 12 months is cash value contribute to the companies become more and more significant as we evaluate it.","Going forward, if we can move that 15% and excuse me I think there are number of things that we haven't done that we could do, Karl talked about them, Mike talked them, in terms of expanding the kind of product offerings which could encourage people to stay more, repeat more money with E*TRADE and we have a good, it's hard to believe but we have a very good investment track record.","It would be hard pressed, you need to be Sherlock Holmes looking through some of the information we have in order to help you do that but the track record we generated is very, very good, we just haven't brought it to the floor in the meaningful way. So I would go back and maybe I'll be accused year from now saying that you did that one more year after Jesus was born in terms of when you were talking about it but I do think that the cash level contribution rolls in, rolls in every year, and that makes as Mike said it, that makes a very significant contributions what we anticipate would contribute materially to the spread income we see in that five-year growth plan and spread income is an extremely significant part of it.","So I would say our confidence in the power, checking with the recent growth of corporate services, the cash is generating and if that is aided by further expansion of retention rate then I think you've got to let it grow more strongly.","Karl Roessner","Yes, and Christian we are really focused on the experience for the end customers here and that that's one of the biggest things. There is the focus throughout the organization in our stock plan for the unit as well as our retail brokerage unit to really focus on that the impact we can have on the corporate clients coming in and making their service is impactively delivered. Then the first interaction of that stock plan customer has with us when they go into accept their award or start their relationship with E*TRADE is as seamless as possible and introducing them to what they can do next and the solutions that we have building out on our digital wealth platform, right everything from our robots to our pre-built ETF offering that we have now and really concentrating our marketing and our efforts around the dates of those brands, helping these individuals understand educating them on what's available when they come into newfound wealth and that's where the focus comes from and that's where my confidence comes from that we can shift that 15% upwards. On the type of pool that we talked about during the prepared remarks, one percentage point move is meaningful, so that's where we're coming from.","Rodger Lawson","I would just add Christian we grew the pool from $150 billion to $260 billion. We have the leading product in the space and are growing quite considerably even if the 15% remains we will deliver significant value and that value is what we're reflecting in the plan. We don't make any heroic assumptions about that percentage going up higher to hit the financial targets that we imply.","Karl Roessner","That's the short answer, Christian.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Rich Repetto","How are you doing? I guess the first question thank you for Rodger for acknowledging, there is a potential for market corrections recessions, the risk of the zero commissions, you could even see some Fed easing over I guess over five years, so I guess my question is what discount rate as you shoot and I know the opportunities are out there but what kind of risk or discount rate do you use and if you could help us why did would you suggest we use and what's the present value as you do all this and you measure the risk versus these opportunities, what present value did you all come up with?","Michael Pizzi","Yes, Rich. I mean, I think that calculating our cost of equity given sort of areas, measures of beta the 10-year yield it should be a pretty straightforward calculation, you're going to land depending on what assumptions you use and sort of a 9% to 10% range maybe slightly higher depending on sort of modeled assumptions. I think that that's pretty standard in terms of sort of discounting in sort of cash flow discounting, if you're trying to build some sort of DCF analysis of what we're modeling.","Rodger Lawson","Rich, could I just ask a couple of -- couple of other comments. You and I think Patrick, Patrick goes honestly were two of the individuals that have written relatively comprehensive assessments of what I call revenue yields and I have announced a different name but I will call it revenue because I'm old fashioned. And I think it's pretty clear that we are not.","No, no it's youngerish. I think in fact what this, I think the revenue yield analysis is an important one because the model we have I think does deliver higher revenue yield. Now the point you made I think in your last note was yes, guys can you sustain that with growth and of course it's the right question, we would all agree with that question, I think when the board went through the multi-year plan, I mean, many of the board members and I think the reality is this is not an easy group, this is a demanding group, we went through the plan, we went through in consulate details that actually I think as we traversed a five-year plan without I'll use Mike\u2019s comments without any heroic assumptions around growth in some of the key driver metrics, we still are sustaining our very, very attractive high revenue yield which clearly contributes to the margins that people were questioning about. So I think as we look forward yes there could be a big market correction and we will all suffer with that. I'm not sure if today count as a big market correction, I guess if your stock comes down from 66 bucks to 50, if you own the stock you feel that's a pretty big market correction.","So I think for each story, we've had a pretty significant market correction in the last few months but only could continue to happen and if it does it does. But the essence of our model I think even if we do see that I won't say there are natural hedges in everything that we do but trading comes down potentially margin comes down, cash goes up, there are many interesting trades of, trade-offs and as we talked about this with the board I think we've got ourselves reasonably to comfortable I mean the sky could fall, who knows, but we've got ourselves reasonably comfortable in the fact that this is the kind of numbers that Mike talked about over the five-year horizon are very achievable in most environments and we all lived through 2008 no one knew what most was in 2008 is certainly different world. But I think we believe even in negative scenarios but our revenue yield will hold up and our ability to deliver the kind of returns we're talking about will hold up. Time will tell Rich.","Rich Repetto","Yes and I appreciate the insight it's great to communicate with you on this. So I guess that the follow-up question would be I have done a discounting in the time that we had and present valued what -- off of a multiple of earnings. But I guess the question is when we compare that did you all seek out what the market would put on E*TRADE today did you actually seek out when get bids or have any interaction like that and as along as on that subject as well and you've been guiding the process Rodger just trying to see what your future I know the employer -- I think your employment contract ends at the end of the year and just want to see whether you'll still be guiding the shift here to the five-year and $7 of earnings.","Rodger Lawson","Let me start with the last one. When we have the -- I think I call might we went to the Barclay Conference off we have the management changes in 2016 because we figured it was best to get out, get out there and explain what the hell we were doing. At that time I think I talked about the fact that as we've made the changes backed I rationalized why we had confidence in Karl, while we had confidence in Mike, I also explained about the board asked me if the two years I would be Executive Chairman, so I moved from being non-Executive Chairman and life of luxury to becoming an Executive Chairman which is what I did and so now we're in day to day life.","I think frankly since then I -- we have had our ups and downs a lot of things have been happening but I think we feel comfortable I thought I know we would feel comfortable that things are moving in the right direction. I think the need for an Executive Chairman has now -- certainly at this period of time has been removed so we will be sticking to the original plan we discussed I will step down at the end of the this year and into the end of December and I will revert back to being non-Executive Chairman so I will no longer the part of management Rich I\u2019ll become, I'll revert back to being a member of the board bearing in mind I'm going back to the status I was just before we made the changes we made the last time. Karl?","Karl Roessner","And Rich on the question about whether or not we didn't market check went out to third parties that wasn't something that were pursued it's a valuation. But please keep in mind that we had a large investment bank come in, do the assessment for us and that assessment obviously included all of the current market information, ability, capacity to pay, I mean, you name it and go through it. The board looked at it it's a very fully informed board, they had the right legal counsel, they had the right banks here, and they did what they needed to do to get themselves comfortable with the value creation that this management team believes that it can deliver over a period of time versus what could hypothetically be out there in the marketplace.","Rodger Lawson","I mean just confirm what Karl is saying and well what Mike said earlier we are well informed we didn't come in one day and toss the coin, this was a lot of work which was done to get into this position and so there are no hockey sticks in this plan, there were ridiculous aspirational goals which can never be fulfilled. So it was very, very serious consideration and I mean the bottom-line of it is the comments which we made in the prepared statements we clearly felt this was where we are at the moment is a better path forward than the alternative which I know a lot of other people have speculated about.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Chris Harris","Thanks hi guys. So deposit growth and balance sheet growth is a clear challenge for everyone in industry right now and then it puts and takes in your operating model here and I just want to ask you guys directly if we assume that the balance sheet has stayed flat, you still think you can hit mid-teens EPS growth target under that scenario?","Karl Roessner","Chris, let me just answer the question this way. If you look at sort of the puts and takes or the sort of the current balance sheet we are in another record year of customer net buying. So it'll be two subsequent years of very high levels of customer net buy that should in theory drive your cash balance has down we're holding relatively flat that flatness is caused by the dynamics of our business in terms of growth, in terms of corporate services. So if you're saying the environment is to see a continual market environment where we see this level of engagement in this level of interest then what we're going to see is sort of higher DART volumes, higher margin balances has really offsets the lower cash growth and that's exactly what you've seen in the current year. We have to look at that scenario but I would feel really good about the value that that scenario would deliver over the same five years.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please go ahead.","Kyle Voigt","Hi good evening. Just another question on the 50% operating margin target by 2020 just wondering any scenario where pricing may come under more pressure than you anticipate do you still believe that you have the expense flexibility to hit the 50% target and maybe you could talk about what levers you have on the expense side. Thanks.","Michael Pizzi","Well, we drew our operating margin right through the last cut and the environment had a lot doing that but we grew through that period, so in looking at it yes obviously in the period of which you have to make a pricing adjustment you'll suffer deterioration in operating margin but if you pick up on the gross trend right there after, you\u2019ll get right back on and driving it forward. As far as expense levers there are numerous expense levers that we been very disciplined and that would cause us to be even more disciplined about how we allocate sort of the dollars in money that we spend to achieve the 50% target.","Operator","And our next question comes from line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Bedell","Great, good evening folks. And some back to the valuation analysis for independent E*TRADE versus sales scenario you Rodger in that analysis do you guys run that or have you run down on a scenario basis in other words is your sort of DCS based purely on the outlook for Slide 34 or do you also consider a percentage chance or scenario of obviously an adverse environment over that period where the margins would be much lower with their commissions or trade cut would be much lower there were the Fed would be -- would be cutting is that part of what gets put into the valuation allowances.","Rodger Lawson","Well we certainly looked at multiple scenarios with the outside advices and in terms of how we reach the range of valuation that we saw over the course of the next five years whether we tested every single upside, downside scenario I think is -- is questionable but I would say 90% of the scenario as we could envisage we tested and I think in the context of that looking at the market, this one was in China and there's little doubt that the decision to remain independent in terms of the intrinsic value it would probably create for our shareholders, was I would characterize as a no-brainer it was so very, very straightforward that may change. I mean I think there's a little doubt, Kyle, that may change over time but it's certainly I think it's crystal clear at the moment, based on all the analytics we did.","Brian Bedell","So even in running an adverse scenario you wouldn't come up with a valuation that was potentially lower than what someone would be willing to pay for E*TRADE?","Rodger Lawson","Lower than -- well I'm not sure I understand your question, say it again Kyle.","Brian Bedell","Yet you have to see if you've got a scenario where things are moving adversely such as cutting environment and\/or commissions, is being most challenged than the modest production you have in scenario. Just evaluation that you would come up with your company under this adverse scenarios did that also exceed what a third-party valuation would be?","Rodger Lawson","Well of course it depends on the buyer and what they're offering. If someone comes along and offers a $100 a share comp I'm sure we would think seriously about that but I think the reality is that the answer to your question is yes it did I think we felt very, very comfortable with the value that was being generated here in relation to any probable realistic scenario that we could see here in terms of sale environment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. I guess just another question on the process and you highlighted EPS growth and ROE expansion are the primary metrics that you're going to be focused on, five years is a long time period, so how should we think about the pace of that in terms of the re-evaluation the board will take, are we going to hear from you once a year in terms of coming in and updating us or just want to get a sense of what if there is limited growth here to start or expansion for the first year or two, is that something that is short enough time period to re-evaluate?","Karl Roessner","So Dan I think the easiest way to explain this one is this is as I said a very engaged board. So Rodger in his role as Executive Chairman as obviously part of the management team has been engaged and involved with us, as he sort of steps down and goes into his Chairman role again, I would fully imagine that he will continue to be engaged with us, he won\u2019t be on the earnings calls going forward unless he had something obviously to say to all about something. But the process the board goes through, they do their scrutiny of where we are in the evaluation of this company and they evaluate what we can produce for our shareholders on a regular basis.","Right, this is a board that takes their fiduciary duties very seriously, so I don't want to pin the board to a timeframe or event driven or other items but I can just tell you rest assured this is a board that will look at all scenarios and if there is something that can impact the value that can deliver to our shareholders they will absolutely act on it.","Rodger Lawson","Let me add a couple of other items. As I go to Rich Repetto's question, as I go back to the non-Executive Chairman and it is being part of the process of being Executive Chairman, the company is run by the CEO and by his management team and we are very conscious of making certain very few perfect relationship between board and management, I'm kind of a hybrid or sort of among going in the middle of the moment.","But before we move to this structure and again just being perfectly blunt, we move to this structure we had with the board believed in Karl, we supported Karl, Karl was my recommendation to take over CEO and board supported that totally, I was in General Counsel, it is not normal to promote General Counsel. He came in and he did a terrific job, I'm not part of my process was to be here as a -- what shall I say a transitional figure. I've always struggled to keep my mouth shut anyway but the point is I was there as a transitional figure but before we have the change the board is there, so I\u2019m just echoing Karl\u2019s comments. And I would imagine that is not going to change, we are not going to disappear into the ether as a result of this. You should expect the board will continue to be very involved.","With regard to the other part of your question which I think is a good question and I certainly thought about it and although I don't want to get into oh my God you missed your net new asset growth by quarter of 1%, you should jump out the window, we don't want to go through that process all over again but we are conscious as a board about the fact that how do we evaluate this over time in terms of how we are performing and how we are performing.","I\u2019m not being evasive, that will be an ongoing process and there are some metrics, I remember occasions at Fidelity when I try to preach to the media about the value of Fidelity managed dollar versus the value of a Vanguard managed dollars, it went into their index funds.","I totally was preaching to the unconverted and they did their own progress, so as we look to the future, there may well be issues of asset close that is why I made the comment about the revenue yield in terms of Rich's observations.","But we will -- but there will be periods when we see numbers which would make it a little uncomfortable but we will continuously come back to the issue of what are the financial returns that we're generating because those financial returns will obviously generate shareholder value. I don\u2019t think there is any fixed room we are going to make any decisions, we are not going to come in every other Thursday and decide but I think you could, well say I think you can assume I can definitely tell you with this board, you can assume we're constantly reviewing all these metrics in line, are we delivering on the earlier questions from Kyle about will we be able, are we truly attained the potential values, the shareholder values that we anticipated. So it's going to continue to be an active process, will still be a pain in the neck, I'm sure that's the way it's going to be.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Michael Cyprys","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just on revenue streams, how satisfied would you say that you are with the diversity of revenue today at E*TRADE about two-thirds interest income, how you are thinking about diversifying it and which revenue line do you see the biggest room for growth looking out?","Rodger Lawson","Listen that has lack of that, it is a very, very good question. I think that the clearly the large part of our revenue stream is from spread income, oh my god you are a regional bank, when you look at things like that but in reality the genesis of a lot of those revenue streams is not regional bank likely. Mike talked about corporate services; you see what's happening in our retail brokerage space. So as we look at those, those are clearly going to be important revenue streams and important margin streams of the company. Mike and Karl talked and can talk more articulately about it than I can.","As we look though to the future, RIA, managed money, banking -- banking services, I do think, I really do think and the board believes that they will become quite more important elements of our earnings but even by 2023, they will more than pay for lunch but they're not going to be the dominant as dominant as the spread income is in the company.","I would however add let's just take the issues of managed money and as I said earlier I think our competence is much greater than the Street realizes. It will be really in terms of revenue, quite a small proportion of our revenue but it's a retention element and one of the board members said there is a defensive element, it really does keep a lot of clients in-house.","So it also adds therefore that issue of spread income because plans for cash flows. Even out to the 2023 period, I would say less than the third of our total revenues going to be coming out of those what you might characterize as newer spaces or spaces we have been developing over the last 18 months or so but we don't have shareholding.","Karl Roessner","Yes, and again to look at it holistically in that same vein, we will always be focused on our active trader sort of core customer population. So when you talk about some of these other items that we have and that we have gone to on the RIA channel with TCA on expanding what we are doing on a corporate services side and making sure that we are driving that funnel looking at our digital wealth solutions even the simple core portfolios, the robots the pre-built ETFs the managed solutions that we have, those are all about performing and our bank products and we talked about bank products a lot, those are about performing at deeper and broader relationship with our customer set to drive more share of wallet to E*TRADE or to make them a more holistic E*TRADE.","When you look at the bank products for example if you can help someone become a banking customer with E*TRADE on the data that we have they have three times more assets with us, they are two times higher in wallet share, they are three times higher revenue with us, they do twice as many trades and they have tried about half the time or half as much as our normal customer set does.","So that\u2019s relationship building, that's driving at our core which is going to continue we believe to keep those cash balances that Mike talked about at the right levels for growing while we engage and drive additional revenue streams. So it's all part of sort of a holistic message, so I think Rodger is going to spot on in terms of the way that it will split out over time, I don't believe you'll see an enormous diversification of revenue streams what you will see is a broader and deeper client relationship where we have more of their funds with us.","Michael Pizzi","And the only thing I would add to that is that key drivers in the net interest side, you have the margin book, you have securities lending, those are core to our business, it\u2019s been a record quarter on margin again at $11.2 billion for the quarter end, there's a lot of things that go through net interest and a good bit of it is related to the core of our business and the growth of that business.","Michael Cyprys","Okay, great. Just follow-up on the operating margin mid-50, can you just talk about what's embedded there in terms of investments back into the business for growth and how do you know you're investing enough for growth just given increased competition and disruptors in the space?","Michael Pizzi","We look actively in terms of project list in terms of resourcing, in terms of where to draw the line in terms of things to fund and investments to make in the overall business, we understand the power of technology how to improve in terms of operational efficiency and driving that investment, that's a lot of the work that we're doing right now really within the company, as we really looking forward we've evaluated the environment, we're looking at the amount we're spending, we're looking at what reasonably can be put to work and we think we're making the right investments. Obviously if disruption changes the industry or we need to spend more, we're going to talk to you about that, we're going to do what we need to do to maintain competitiveness and position within the industry.","Rodger Lawson","And Mike, I will just add another thing as plug for Karl or Mike and that is and I think part of the rationale CEO officer role, I mean we have some very, very strong people within the company but was to ensure that we didn't lose, we didn't lose anything in terms of operating efficiency and Mike made the comments in his prepared remarks about continue to grow operating leverage and I think Karl and I chat about this a few days ago. We understand the challenges in the marketplace, I'm sure the things we don't see that will come along but I mean I do think we view money as fungible and I think we will make whatever harsh decisions we have to make in terms of allocation of resources to ensure that when even at our scale, I'm not outmaneuvered by some people who have larger budgets.","But I think actually honestly it's a plug for these guys, I don't think the management team gives enough credit for the discipline in terms of the execution around efficiency on driving operating margin and all those I think will contribute to answering your question, I think your question is a good question by the way, I think is a very relevant question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","Hey, good afternoon. Maybe just one from me and you guys might disagree with this characterization but at least in my perception E*TRADE's external communications about the criteria to remain independent does seem to more between September 2016 and today with initially a much greater emphasis on those tangible growth factors and things like net new asset growth, things that you discussed at the Barclay's Conference in the third quarter 2016 earnings call, can you talk about why the evaluation criteria appears that extended over time?","Rodger Lawson","I don't know that extended that much over time, Patrick. Well, good evening Patrick, so long time since I have heard your voice. I think the -- I didn't think moved that much over time but I mean I think one of the intriguing things and I kind of touched on it earlier. All those drivers, all those things are very, very important. So we hit $6.2 billion in terms of that managed money that was one of our targets, well done. The reality is it will doesn\u2019t make a material difference in terms I think of our bottom-line or EPS at this stage of the game but as we have gone through that period and we've been focused on those operator drivers, three of which I would argue the one which one you want to focus on we have, I would say that it has changed very positively, the discipline of the company, and in terms of how we approach, how we manage and I think that I would say in all seriousness Patrick the financial results that has been delivered by the company speak for themselves in terms of the progress that's being made over those two years.","I think also has given us a realistic appreciation of the net new asset flow. Early when Rich was asking the question, I mean I read your book Patrick and I think in fact when you were talking about revenue yield, I can't remember whatever you called it, is it broker, I can\u2019t currently remember.","But what I called revenue yield but we look to that and I think, as we gone through this period, I think we recognized there are other drivers, we all live in land, there are other drivers of the revenue yield and therefore our contribution to that gross margins that we haven\u2019t seen. So yes, we made we missed on the broker target, we hit the other ones and but I think the most important thing that's come out of it, I'm going to say for new E*TRADE sounds too theatrical but I do think those are all the things that we made, the comments we made in our prepared remarks, it has changed the attitude towards the company.","And that is also by the way why I talked to the end about EPS growth rate and ROE, there are deserving things we look and I'm sure you guys will look at more than I will because you actually have more detailed knowledge but what is nice about the ROE and EPS it fundamentally drives valuation if you believe over a period of time and I think it is a nice straightforward common denominated metrics, so it\u2019s a long way to answer your question but I'd say we have been focused on them but they have enabled the company's performance to much more aggressively by focusing on them Patrick than we originally thought would happen.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks. I just wanted to come back to the net new asset organic growth rate and some of your earlier comments on the RIA custody channel, do you think there is an opportunity to improve the gap versus swap in Ameritrade and also have you thought about also reporting an adjusted metric that also includes inflows from your Corporate Services Business?","Michael Pizzi","Yes, obviously I think we can improve our growth rate with what we're doing in E*TRADE advisor services. The $12 billion of pipeline that we announced today is a pretty amazing number. We have $12 billion of commitments to move on to the platform we bought the business it was about $17 billion to $18 billion and we were on board to billion since April. It is when you look at sort of our quarterly flows what is an amount of assets were coming from that channel well you can see quite clearly that it's going to pick up the percentage growth rate in assets, now in Corporate Services yes we don't well we have customers you know who do not take an action.","They sort of just allow their stock to vest we don't report that in net new assets we wait for that customer to take an action and sell that stock. We're giving you that breakout really for the first time in the Investor Deck that's a very conservative way of looking at net new assets. We've historically that's the way we've done it. We've thought of that the right way but if you actually took that vesting and put it through net new and moved it from the unvested portion then you would get a much higher rate of net new asset growth.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.","Devin Ryan","Great, thanks good evening. So you guys highlighted M&A a couple of times in the prepared remarks and I think the view was that any M&A during the past two-year assessment period would be modest which makes sense but now that we're through that do you expand what you're thinking about or open to and then I guess is there anything larger that maybe could make sense to enter what the scale deal and then just more broadly any other update on the types of things you might be looking at?","Karl Roessner","Yes, I think look for the most part our focus remains the same, what can we do deliver better for our customers so their product set or are there additional capabilities that our customers are looking for whether that be through the RIA custody channel, through our retail brokerage channel, or on the corporate services side and obviously if there's any kind of scale playing corporate services or something you can do to accelerate the growth of the RIA channel we'll look at that.","The one thing that I would say is we were pretty restrictive in terms of discussing transformative or larger scale M&A during the last two years. What I would say is we will remain disciplined we will continue to run anything that we look at through the same capital lens that means used in the past, to make sure that that will generate or drive significant value for our shareholders or we're not going to do it but I'm not offended about not looking at larger transactions or larger deals that may be even drive shareholder value over time.","Devin Ryan","Okay, great thank you and then just a quick follow-up here so there kind of related to DCA internal referrals have been huge for your custodian peers and so appreciate some of that color did you have any stats internally of either whether it be in the corporate stock plan or the self-directed brokerage side, how many assets you're actually losing to RIA relationships or any thoughts on that and then just on the economics can you just help us with what those will look like if you keep those assets in-house and some others around 25 basis points.","A \u2013 Rodger Lawson","So I think this might be actually the shortest answer of that evening and I apologize for that, we don't disclose their status we do know where the where they transfer to and when they go we do have some pretty good data on the conversations that or had with FC channel and folks come to E*TRADE and ask whether or not we have in RIA channel or have somebody that can drive in a Big Box, so there is a reason that we went out of the RIA platform that we did in terms of the custody platform the TCA.","And the other part of that is our referral network and some of the pieces that are going to place will really start to fall in line over the next few weeks so more to come on that channel and including what we believe it drives and what value we're deriving from it. But we look at it as just a phenomenal tool to help us with both maintaining our stock plan customers and also driving additional value from both existing retail and future retail come to us.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","Hey thanks guys. Rodger just a question for you had a growth has been healthy and management plan and it seems reasonable. I guess just curious given where we are in the cycle for rates in retail engagement your competition heating up net new asset targets a bit tougher to hit why not look at maybe a dual track the management plan and then also seeing what did you out there just given, the known synergies and the industry consolidation.","A \u2013 Rodger Lawson","Well, actually I'm glad you asked that question. Mike and I was going to make a comment at the end because there is two or three good questions have been asked about that. The board really effectively assesses valuation every year on this company. I think I mentioned at the first time with the Barclays Conference a couple of years ago but it is a process that's gone on for a reasonably lengthy period of time. We're not casual about it, we recognize where E*TRADE's come from and it's Lazarus [ph] rising from the dead effectively but us getting into such a strong position now but each year we've gone to that process we've done evaluation.","I will say that we haven't looked at times that I recall one period when I think the stock was 11 bucks a share. I joined in 2012 myself and Becky Saeger both joining at the same time the stock was eight bucks I think, it probably dropped, so it's great for my ego, but then when it was around $11 we did at very thorough assessment of valuation. We did something similar and there are we had comments from people respected and people around the sort of said we should do that so the $11 we did it and I think in the low 20s as well, an extremely evaluation we didn't talk to third parties on outside we did it pretty much inside basis we've just done it. And I wish we made the decisions that are the preference at that time we should say where we're going to go forward and I would arguing and Mike just thought the market's been lousy in the course of the last six or eight weeks that the board made and its very similar though we have a very modest changes.","We made very wise decisions in terms of a shift shareholder value. So what I would say rather than start has running, I'm running parallel experiences which I think can be destructive of value. I think we do trust and your judgment and in terms of using the kind of processes we've used as to where value sets. I'd also say and it is a reality we know I use the words are we know our fiduciary responsibility is. Actually we do, and we're open-minded. If someone comes along wants to talk to us and that may well, that may well be an interesting opportunity. All I know is, Michael, we would look at it very seriously and we do what we did when we looked at those two prior examples I gave you. They were not formal offers but they were certainly discussions. So I think the process we have we don't want to destroy value and we don't want to start as running we want as much stability.","People do work here with their tails off to bring this company back to I think as you look at our margins a highly competitive state, and so I think a process that which what we should do as a board in terms of evaluating our value, the way we approach it I think is a more sanguine and a more responsible way of handling it.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","Good evening. Thanks for taking the question and thanks for the patience it's been a long call. So my question for Rodger, you laid out these targets two years ago what's often held up as the most important metric for the group is net new assets, it's the target he missed and you missed the range by pretty wide margin. So I know that you laid out that you don't have the RIA business and that might be the reason but you knew you didn't have the RIA business when you laid the targets out, so there are a lot of investors that have got involved in your stock based upon target, setting the targets or pursuing a sale. And now you're telling us that you didn't even get any bids. So can you just explain that with a little bit more of a justification as to why you wouldn't pursue that process a bit more thoroughly?","A \u2013 Rodger Lawson","All right. So I'd go back to the beginning on conference and is the Barclays Conference in September. Actually immediately after that conference we met with various investors like a member of [indiscernible]. They very clear that they thought that we were deluding ourselves because of the absence of that channel. I think we probably expected more in terms of where that would -- we could grow it. We probably underestimated, heaven forbid. We underestimated what we anticipated what might be the growth rate from our business.","In terms of going forward another comment which I've kind of alluded to when I talk to them about Rich and Patrick's observations about revenue yield. The model we have is not exactly shabby. It does generate a very, very high level of revenue yield; we're very, very pleased with that even though our growth rates in assets, net new assets is not as great as others in the marketplace and I forgive me I think it was Dan asked -- Dan Fannon asked the question about did we expect affectively to grow the same right as some of our competition, I think the answer is no. And actually we expect to grow the place of someone large. Well, TRUP is a machine in terms of our raise of the assets and I think that's even on even CD I think is a very effective in raising assets since our RIA channel. We don\u2019t expect to grow that rate but we look at it and I would say truthfully, Brennan. I think we put our money where our mouth is in terms of how we develop to the financial performance of the company. ","I don't think I can remember precisely, I know I should but I can't. The time we had our conference our stock was 26 or 27 bucks, I mean okay real crying out there at the moment because there's been become a tad back in the market for whatever reason but it's affecting us all pretty much. We probably marginally [indiscernible] I'm sure some of our money figured we were going to sell and, therefore, get the hell out of it. But in practical terms we have delivered a lot of value. I mean material value. I don\u2019t think it's anything we need to be ashamed of and as I said earlier, assume I'm going to jump out of the window because we didn't hit our net new asset flows.","Scale is very, very valuable. I -- we agree scale matters, size matters. And I would rather see us having more flows than not, but we're not going to chase after them or overpay for them we'll build them in a considered and realistic way. So we feel extremely comfortable what we've done and the key to question and your question is a fair question. I'm not offended by it, your question is a fair question. I think as we go forward we really believe we could deliver these values I mean shareholders of E*TRADE probably turned upside down in 2007, 2008 we're not going to get away value now if you really figure that and the board sees out value.","Brennan Hawken","That's fair, that's fair, but I guess one other way of looking at it would be that there's been tremendous earnings growth which is totally true and totally valid but here we're standing towards the tail-end of what's been a great cycle, interchange has been a tailwind. The management team's done a great job of not botching it which prior -- previous E*TRADE management teams maybe a different story, but isn't this a time to look around you've got this wonderful set up given you weighted up the two-year target, you guys are small and it's a scale business increasingly and so there are many who argue that this could be an opportune time to actually go through and assess some bids. And so I guess that's the difficulty that I throwing with here.","Rodger Lawson","So Brennan, let me come and trying to get more color in the sense this we look around all the time, don't sit in our ivory tower, actually you know there's nothing happening around us in the world. We look around all the time. So whatever premium we could prognosticate from where we are today the plans we look out we believe whatever valuation methodology used we believe the plans we have will deliver considerable value then taking out looking at taking our understanding of what's going on forward into a more serious engagement with someone. So we made as a board a realistic decision that was more value remaining independent and growing through the plan what we see in terms of what's out there in the marketplace. If someone wants to come along and offers 100 bucks of share we know our responsibilities.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Chris Allen with Compass Point. Please go ahead.","Chris Allen","Good evening guys. Just wanted two quick questions one on TCA the $12 billion and the pipeline's impressive maybe if you would give us some color just in terms of how many TCA clients use them for the sole provider trying to think about who's coming on board to tap into the E*TRADE federal program versus using them as the sole providers think about organic growth longer term there? And then the secondarily any update on October DARTs and margin balance and again number client queries on that one?","Karl Roessner","Yes, sure. So the TCA e channel is pretty widespread in terms of uptick we've seen we are right now sizing in scoping the referral programs both for the national and then regional and local programs many of TCAs lots of TCAs existing RIAs are interested in getting involved with that and we announced in the prepared remarks that Edelman Financial has joined us as well which were quite excited about. So that sort of where we are. I think that business is a very nice business for us in terms of the company platform gives us a lot of optionality and a lot of opportunity to engage a little differently with our retail clients and our stock plan, administration plans just they come through the pipeline.","On the DARTs number to date we're up about 8% from the end of September and our margin balances sitting at about $11.5 billion as of yesterday.","Chris Allen","Thanks.","Karl Roessner","Okay. So that is it for this call. I appreciate everybody joining and I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, it does conclude the call for today.

Good evening, it is truly a pleasure to be joining here to share our perspectives on E*TRADE's performance and progress in 2014. This was a momentous year for E*TRADE's the one in which we benefitted from a more focused organization and we shaped our brand both to better connect with our customers. A year of sustained operation under a significantly upgraded risk management framework, ensuring we executed deliberately and with the right controls, and even more striking all our accomplishments are buoyed by the strong financial position and regulatory standing we\u2019ve had in years leading to consistent delivery in our capital plan and value creation for our shareholders while positioning us to create even more in the future.","Building on this momentum and on behalf of the board and my colleagues, I am incredibly proud to announce the most significant developments the company has seen in years with respect to capital efficiency and company structure. To quickly summarize the announcements we\u2019ve made today, we received a go-ahead from our regulators to operate E*TRADE bank at a leverage ratio of 9% and to remove our broker dealers from under the bank placing them closer to the parent enabling us to distribute to the parent excess capital of approximately $430 million. We will cover these items in more detail shortly.","Now back to 2014 and a quick walk through of our key highlights. During the year we posted our strongest bottom line results since 2006, saw record customer engagement across a host of metrics particularly in asset and account growth evolved a public base of E*TRADE with a revamped brand platform, enhance the digital experience with our customer, ceased opportunities to eliminate asymmetric risks by selling legacy assets in a non-core business, navigated our first required stress test submission with satisfying results and feedback, receive regulatory approval for consistent quarterly capital distributions from our bank and paid down corporate debt with cash for the first time in the company\u2019s history.","This is a distinguished list of achievements and I cannot thank my colleagues enough for their hard work this year. When I began two years ago, we went to great lengths to realign our internal operating structure to empower colleagues to execute more effectively. We then took a hard look at our processes to see what we could improve.","During 2014, we were well into implementation and we are just starting to see the benefits of increased rigor, improved connectivity across the firm and the upgraded quality of our delivery, all centering on a resolute drive that everything we do results in improvements to the customer and drives long term value for our owners. With these many internal changes we are well positioned to deliver the industry leading products and top notch services our customers deserve. We are just beginning to see this culture impact their results and look forward to more fully witnessing the products of our labors in the coming years.","You\u2019ve heard me talk a lot about our commitments to reclaim our disruptive digital roots. In pursuit of this goal we\u2019ve also realigned our technology development to be more intricately woven into the fabric of our entire organization. Our technologists now work more seamlessly across the company to wipe out customer pain points and deliver innovative products, backed by more rigorous and robust design and testing.","As a result, this quarter caps a year of significant additions enhancements to the digital experience for our customers. Most recently we rolled out new customer navigation for etrade.com delivering a more elegant and intuitive web experience. We also further enhanced the mobile experience through added stock plan functionality which builds on the year of impressive mobile advancements, including our iOS 8 with first-to-market functionality, new ETF screeners, and additional research tools and resources just to name a few.","Our innovative browser trading app came out of beta this quarter which delivers real time clothes, research and trade execution at any web page being browsed. This follows a year in which we enhanced our online advisor and fixed income solution center added more functionality to our elite trading platform E*TRADE pro and launched back end enhancements allowing us to be more nimble with delivery of web content.","These efforts on top of our already strong offerings resulted in external recognition throughout the year across a number of renowned public \u2013 applications. We received a four start rating from Barron\u2019s and Best in Mobile from Kiplinger's. Stockbrokers.com awarded this number one ratings for mobile and client dashboards, along with five best in class ratings for customer service, investor education, research, mobile trading and new investors. We were named most improved in the industry by J. D. Power and given a number one rating for client satisfaction and loyalty for the third consecutive year by industry critic group 5 for our stock plan management platform equity edge online.","As a digital centric organization we devote significant time and energy to make sure we deliver an industry leading mobile experience. The accolades we have received detest [ph] to my colleagues success in building a robust digital mobile environment which is only increasing importance across the industry. About 12% of our trades came through our mobile app during the fourth quarter, even more telling over a quarter of customer log ins occurred to this channel prove that the future of personal finance is increasingly quite literally in the palm of our customers hand.","Our digital experience, however, is only one side of E*TRADE point as it\u2019s backed by personal support and expert guidance. So this year we also enhanced this human experience capitalizing on the new leadership and our corporate services division, customer service teams, financial consultants sales and branches and arming our front line employees with better tools to meet our customers wants and needs.","Turning to our financial results. We recorded earnings of $1.12 for the year, a net income of $330 million, excluding a $59 million pretax charge related to our debt transaction in November. Earnings benefited from increased customer engagement, low credit costs and an elevated net interest spread. Only Q1s multi year high end DARTs, trading activity held in well increasing 12% for the year inclusive of a 10% sequential increase in Q4. Options continue to account for about 22% of trades in Q4 consistent with the full year mix. Our customers trading across other asset classes continues to be minimal with futures accounting for 1.5% of trades and 4X making up about 30 basis point.","Trading in January to date is holding quite steady compared to December currently up 3% thus far. While solid not exactly the jump in activity we like to see at the start of the year as investors have remained somewhat sidelined in light of uncertainty around oil and major turbulence within European markets and currencies.","Another important indicator of customers engaged with the market is margin receivables which reached record levels during the year and ended at $7.7 billion, down from $8.1 billion at the end of Q3. The yield actually picked up this quarter for the first time since 2011 as a result of the balance of shifting a higher pricing to your accounts.","In terms of bringing in net new assets and accounts, we added over 17,000 net new accounts in the quarter bringing our full year total to 146,000 the highest in over a decade. Meanwhile attrition improved for the seventh consecutive year albeit modestly to 8.7% from 8.8%. And Q4 was consistent with the prior quarter at 9.1% annualized.","Net new assets of $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter brought our 2014 total to $10.9 billion yet another record and up from $10.4 billion in each of the previous two years. These numbers are encouraging and even more so when noted that one third of our net new assets for the year were on retirement accounts, this is a strategically important area for us as we strive to do more for our customers across the full spectrum of their investing activity.","Building on our unbiased approach to investment products and investment solutions we\u2019ve had a lot of success growing our managed assets which ended the year at $3.1 billion up a third from the end of 2013.","Moving onto expenses and investments in 2015 we intend to carry our momentum forward and continue investing in the business as we\u2019ve made a lot of progress and feel good about our continued prospects and the related value generation.","I\u2019ll take a step back, the motive forces behind our investments are, first, our focus on the business and customer offering. This includes everything from our back office to our marketing dollars. We\u2019ve done a lot in this category and I can tell you that we benefitted tremendously from our intention here. We operate in a more deliberate manner with more cost per elaboration and more discipline across the business.","Along with our foundation we are investing in customer facing roles. We continue to elevate the state of play of our service and sales organizations while technology remains at the forefront of our effort. We also continue to spend opportunistically on marketing environment permitting. And while we are clocking records across assets, accounts and margin we have yet to truly yield benefits of our internal improvements here, but I feel sanguine [ph] about our prospects.","In the second category as far or less selected falling squarely in the table stakes category and that relates to the investments we\u2019ve made in response to the height and demand of today\u2019s regulatory and security environments. Our spend in legal risk and compliance alone for 2014 totaled approximately $90 million which is an increase of 50% from what we spent just two years prior and we expect that number to continue its rise into 2015 to upwards of a $100 certainly not insignificant but absolutely necessary to progress with confidence in today\u2019s operating and regulatory landscape.","While these areas -- legal risk and compliance are often lumped into the category of enterprise risk management, our broader scope beyond this level spent and truly and calculate the fact that risk is now engrained in everything we do across the company. We\u2019ve invested in risk management within all other departments of the firm as well as our systems and technology related to risks. Our headway in building up these areas has been paramount to our regulatory progress and was prerequisite to our ability to secure the approvals we announced today.","Moving onto the capital plan and the jolly important announcements we made today, all of our progress derisking the company and executing on the components of our plan culminated in significant approvals. First, we received regulatory approval to operate E*TRADE bank at a tier 1 leverage ratio of 9% providing more opportunities for capital utilization upon which Matthew will expand. Second, our regulators approved our plan to simplify our legal entity structure removing our broker dealer subsidiaries from under E*TRADE bank which more efficiently positions our source of earnings and capital.","And in conjunction with these approvals excess capital to broker dealers of approximately $430 million will be distributed to the parent during the first quarter of 2015. Going forward, the excess capital generated by these entities will be also be available to the parent. Separately, we plan to request a dividend of another $75 million from the bank to the parent in Q1 and beginning in Q2 we will request quarterly dividends equal to the bank spend income one quarter in arrears.","A brief history lesson in 2009 as part of the company\u2019s efforts disrupt the banks financial position and with some logical regulatory encouragement our introducing broker dealer E*TRADE securities has moved under E*TRADE bank where our clearing broker dealer E*TRADE clearing already resided. This was done to ensure that the bank would stand on its own during a time of significant global stress, suffices to say, our bank is now in a much healthier position so with regulatory approval we have taken the steps to remove both broker dealers from under E*TRADE bank in order to create a more streamlined corporate structure. So what does this mean?","The income and therefore the capital of generation from our brokerage operation will now be housed directly below our parent company, greatly simplifying the movement of capital, moreover, given the explicit regulatory approval to operate the bank at 9% tier 1 leverage ratio we have a much greater flexibility to utilize bank capital generated above that threshold.","We are now faced with the high quality challenge of what to do with the capital and I assure you it is top of mind for us. Reducing our debt by another $400 million continues to be a priority of ours, so as you can imagine we are valuing the most appropriate uses beyond that, again Mathew will update you more on the process.","A final note on the capital front. This issuer received five full notch upgrades by our three credit rating agencies, two of which occurred in conjunction with our November debt pay down and refinance. While we ultimately like to be investment grade these upgrades are a sound testament to the progress we are making and the greatly improved health of the company.","On the management team I regret to announce that our Chief Marketing Officer, Liza Landsman has decided to leave the company to pursue other opportunities. Liza was one of my first hires here and she made significant contributions during her tenure. She revolutionized our approach to marketing turning what was historically an advertising eccentric organization into a data driven analytical one that allows us to continue to make deeper and more meaningful connections with customers and prospects. I\u2019m sorry to see her go.","At the board level we made significant progress to round out and strengthen our Director composition introducing two talented individuals over the last months. Shelley Leibowitz and Jim Healy both of whom sit on the risk oversight committee. Ms. Leibowitz has a deep history with information technology and most recently worked at the World Bank overseeing its product delivery infrastructure and managing its Cyber Security program. Mr. Healy has 25 years of experience with the financial markets and investment banking at Credit Suisse and as an economist at The International Monitory Fund. Both Shelley and Jim are exceptional managers of risk and seasoned operators in their respected fields.","With the addition of these two and after brining on a distinguished former Fed President in the past year our Board governance and support is stronger than ever with a depth of knowledge and expertise across all aspects of our business.","In closing I want reiterate how proud I am of all the team and all that it accomplished in 2014. As we entered 2015 we have the backbone in place to enhance our relationships with our customers and continue to grow the business. I have every confidence that everything we have done to set up the business for executional excellence will continue to benefit customers and our owners.","And I\u2019m particularly proud of our commitment to continuously improve our regulatory standing and all we have accomplished to bring us to position of announcing some of the most significant progress we\u2019ve made since the financial crisis. The vote of confidence to our regulators and improved efficiency in our new corporate structure underscore all that we have done to reduce to manage our legacy risk over the past several years and to install and maintain enterprise risk management capabilities of which we are quite proud.","And with that, I will turn the call over our operus [ph] CFO, Matthew Audette.","Matthew Audette","Thank you, Mr. Idzik. 2014 truly a defining year for the Company as we operationalized a very clear focus and path forward that was started in 2013. From a financial standpoint after laying out a plan less than three years ago, and executing on all the major components we took yet another giant step forward with our announcements today. Our unwavering commitment executing on that plan is quite literally paying dividends.","But before I get into that, I like to go over our results for the quarter and year. We reported fourth quarter net income of $78 million or $0.26 per share excluding a $59 million pretax charge related to corporate debt transaction. This compares to net income of $86 or $0.29 per share in Q3 and net income of $58 million or $0.20 per share in the year ago quarter.","Net revenues of $461 million were up from $440 million in the prior quarter and $446 million in the year ago quarter. Revenue included net interest income of $283 million, up $14 million from the prior quarter as net interest spread increased 15 basis points and our average assets contracted $400 million","Our Q4 spread of 269 basis points reflected an outside benefit from stock lending and margin receivables. On stock lending while we are obviously thrilled with the results over the past couple of quarters, we have a noted a big pull back in stock lending revenue towards the end of the quarter which has continued into Q1. So from where we sit today, stock loan yields are down meaningfully from Q4.","Margin receivables on a similar note which benefited from record high average balances and an uptick in yield during the quarter decline toward the quarter end and remain near those levels today. The macro environment has also failed to cooperate with the unprecedented drop in oil prices followed by a steep drop in interest rates, obviously having an impact on our marginal rates of reinvestment.","So while the environment in Q4 was quite beneficial to spread, the environment we find ourselves in today is much more challenging. And if we assume this current environment holds our net interest spread would decline to the low to mid 240s.","Our balance sheet ended the quarter at $45.5 billion down $0.3 billion from the prior quarter as a result of $1.2 billion of customer net buying and $240 million decline in wholesale funding. The decline in wholesale funding was driven by a temporary funding need in Q3 related to customer activity and rolled off during Q4 as planned. We have $365 million of wholesale obligations expiring during 2015, all of which occurred during the second quarter.","Commissions, fees and service charges, and other revenue in the third quarter were $172 million, up 6% from the prior quarter and up 8% from the year ago quarter. Average commission per trade of $10.84, decline $0.21 in the prior quarter, and $0.13 from the year ago period. This sequential decrease is primarily driven by our mix of options in stock plan trades.","Fees and service charges revenues of $48 million included $23 million of payment for order flow compared with $22 million in the prior quarter. Net gains on loans and securities were $6 million this quarter down from $8 million in the prior quarter. Over the next few quarters we expect gains to continue to be in a range of $5 million to $10 million. Those rates persist at the current lower levels; gains would likely be at the high end of that range.","Our operating expenses for the quarter were $294 million, up from $277 million in the prior quarter, largely related to marketing and professional services. In marketing, where we typically see a seasonal increase, we also spent dynamically as the environment permitted. And in professional services, there is a mix of both of increased hiring as well as some temporary project-related engagements. So there is some room for this the decline going forward.","For the full year 2015 we expect a low to mid single-digit percent increase in full year 2015 expenses. The increase is driven mostly by headcount as we hired throughout 2014 and we\u2019ll have the full year run rate in 2015. It also includes a mid to high single digit increase in marketing, the area where we obviously maintain the most flexibility. However with multiyear records and net new accounts and assets in 2014 we are feeling good about our returns on those dollars.","The loan portfolio entered the quarter at $6.4 billion, down $320 million from the prior quarter. This was again predominantly prepayments, while charge-offs from a minimal at just $7 million. We expect quarterly run-off for 2015 to remain in the range of 4% to 5% per quarter. Provision for loan losses was $10 million in the fourth quarter, flat with the prior quarter.","For all of 2014, our provision of $36 million decline 75% from the prior year. Well, that is tremendous improvement. I want to again reiterate that we expect provision to increase in 2015 and 2016 when the majority of our HELOCs are schedule to convert to amortizing. With that in mind there is no change to our $10 million to $30 million per quarter range, but a bit more color on our expected timing with 2015 expected to be at the lower half of that range, and 2016 to be at the upper half.","Our allowance for loan losses ended the quarter at $404 million, up marginally from the prior quarter. Reserves for the one to four book remain stable at $27 million as charge-offs again netted to zero and the release of reserves abate as we foreshadowed last quarter. Meanwhile the home equity allowance again inched upward and in the quarter at $367 million, a $7 million increase. One last point on the loan portfolio, while CLTVs of both portfolios were unchanged from the prior quarter at 79% for one-to-four family and 92% for home equity, they trended downward during 2013, driven by increase in home prices as well as voluntary principal reductions.","Now, with respect to progress on our capital plan, it was a busy year and we accomplished a tremendous amount. While I know you have heard this before at least for now I won\u2019t get tired of delivering the recount. So to quickly hit the highlights, we successfully cleared our first round of Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests. We reduced significant tail risk through actions taken on our legacy investments including the sale of $800 million of TDRs, the elimination of our remaining non-agency CMOs, and their early termination of a $100 million of wholesale funding.","We demonstrated the sustainability of our enterprise risk management capabilities. We ended the year with the bank Tier 1 leverage ratio at 10.6% even after dividending a total of $300 million from the banks to the parent. And we put that capital to work with a $400 million reduction of corporate debt in conjunction with the $540 million refinance at the lowest coupons in our Company\u2019s history.","And we are certainly starting 2015 on a high note. As Mr. Idzik covered early, we are delighted to announce regulatory approval on one of the key components of our capital plan, operating the bank at a Tier 1 level ratio of 9%. Additionally, we received regulatory approval to move our broker dealers out from under the bank with marks tremendous progress in achieving ongoing capital flexibility.","And lastly, we plan to dividend to the parent excess capital in the broker dealers of approximately $430 million in Q1, taking yet another significant step towards putting capital to work for our shareholders. With respect to the bank\u2019s Tier 1 leverage ratio, we ended the year at 10.5%. Pro forma for the brokerage entity moves, it would be 9.2%, still above our new 9% target.","Regarding the movement of our broker dealer entities, post the financial crisis, we were left with the constraining legal entity structure where our brokerage subsidiaries resided under our bank. The plan realignment involves moving the two subs out from the bank in an effort to create a more streamline and simplified legal entity structure.","E*TRADE securities which was moved under the bank in 2009 to serve as a source of strength at the time when the bank needed it, will be moved in early February. In E*TRADE Clearing, which previously reside under the bank will be moved later in the year. Under our old structure this meant that substantially all of E*TRADE\u2019s earnings were generated within the bank and were subject to bank regulatory approvals in order to extract the results in capital.","Following this reorganization, a significant amount of capital generation will be within closer proximity to the parent. To put this in context around dividends, our old methodology of $75 million per quarter lead to $300 million in 2014 dividends to the parent, assuming our new structure had been implemented on January 1, 2014, we would have moved approximately $225 million of earnings from the bank along with approximately $200 million of capital generation at the broker dealers.","In total this would have led to dividends of approximately $425 million to the parent. As for Q1, once E*TRADE\u2019s securities is moved, we plan to dividend excess capital to the parent, which we estimate to be around $430 million. In the first quarter 2015 we also plan to request approval for another $75 million. And in Q2, 2015 we would transition to our new methodology of requesting the full amount for the prior quarter\u2019s earnings from the bank as well as distributing the excess capital generated at the broker dealers.","Now with respect to capital calculations in the fourth coming implementation of Basel III, we spend a lot of time applying the U.S. final Basel rules to our capital ratio, and there are several items which meaningfully impact us. A few of these we\u2019ve highlighted previously. These include the phase out of trust from the parent capital which will have a negative impact. And changes for the risk weighting across our assets will results to net favorable impact to our ratios, predominantly driven by the way we risk weight margin receivable.","One additional impact we\u2019ve identified is quite positive and that we\u2019ll be able to include a much larger portion of our DTA in regulatory capital, while we still have not finalized the impact to these changes. We do expect a meaningful benefit to our capital ratio. And as a reminder these rules become effective at the beginning of this year. So the impact will be reflected in our Q1 ratios.","One other item that impacted our capital ratios in 2014, we benefited from exceptionally robust customer net buying activity of $7.7 billion, which muted natural balance sheet growth. This is well above normalized levels which were in the $2 billion to $3 billion range. As we mentioned in the past customer activity related [ph] growth is one element that can be challenging to control.","To address this we\u2019re in the process of redesigning our program that tweaks balances to third party banks that will enable us to manage the size of our balance sheet with greater precision while staying in tune with the quality of the customer experience. We expected to be up and running in the coming months. With regard to cash at the parent we ended the quarter with corporate cash of$233 million.","Assuming our planned Q1 dividends of $430 million and $75 million pro forma corporate cash would be $738 million. After taking into account debt service needs this is approximately $500 million above our target of maintaining two years debt service coverage. Additionally at the time we completed our recent debt transaction we installed the $200 million revolving credit facility giving us an added layer of liquidity and flexibility.","Given all we\u2019ve accomplished on our capital plan, the questions we are now face with are less around the timing and process of excess in capital and more around how to put it to use, and that is squarely where our focus lies today. As you are aware, reducing our corporate debt to $1 billion remains the high priority, while the nearest callability on our debt is still 10 months away. We are analyzing whether it make sense to do something sooner obviously keeping economics at the top of mind.","And there are other options available to us a well. One of the most obvious of which is growing the balance sheet. Now that we have regulatory approvals to operate the bank in an explicit ratio, also where the loan portfolio continues to be most valuable in our hands and we have no intension of disposing it in the foreseeable future, the secondary market continues to firm up. So we\u2019re keeping a watchful eye on market activity.","Lastly and every importantly, we are mindful of merits of returning capital directly to our shareholders by buybacks and\/or dividends. So while there are several potential iterations those are broad strokes for capital utilization and we will obviously keep you posted as we make decisions and prepare to take action.","So in summary, we accomplished a lot in 2014, and are even better positioned for 2015. I\u2019m excited about the opportunities that lie ahead both for the business and for our customers, as well as our capital structure and for our shareholders.","And with that operator, we will open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed.","Rich Repetto","Yes. Good evening and congratulations on the regulatory approval. This is definitely a notable step forward. So I guess my question Paul in that as you know went through those laundry list of potential things that you could possibly do. I guess one question is when would we expect the decision or outline on what you actually going to implement? And then, as you \u2013 and you talked about, you mentioned potentially increase in the balance sheet and from what I understand even if you separate the broker from the bank it would have no impact on the SIFI designation. So you\u2019re saying you\u2019re now entertaining potentially growing the balance sheet at the bank that will be in that cap of $50 billion?","Paul Idzik","Rich, it\u2019s always nice to hear from you. Thanks for dialing in. I\u2019ll take the second part of that question first and then Matthew will answer the first part of that question, if that\u2019s okay with you. On that $50 billion mark, Rich, we still have no intension of going past that number. We think we would raise some significant costs in the near term with limited returns particularly given where the yield curve is. But where our balance sheet is today we still have some room to grow if we so choose and with some of the new facilities put in place, we have the ability to manage our balance sheet to a little better degree than we have in the past. And now Matthew will turn and answer the first part of the question.","Matthew Audette","Yes. That\u2019s around the second one Paul. On the first rates, I think the broad strokes that laid out in the prepared remarks, so the things that we\u2019re thinking through, I think it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s pretty well this point as we make decisions on things we\u2019ll update you and view the public and tell you what\u2019s going on. I think our primarily focus remains on getting our debt down to a $1 billion, but I think we\u2019re in that place where we get the high quality of problem of figuring out what to do. We are analyzing everything that we highlighted and we\u2019ll tell you as decisions go along. But where we sit today the degradation is still high in our list.","Rich Repetto","Okay. And then I guess my follow-up state on this topic, I can \u2013 you certainly did a good job at explaining the added capital flexibility by having it closer to the broker, the meaningful generator of earnings. I guess are there any \u2013 I know this is sensitive question, but is it more flexibility from a corporate transaction standpoint now does that entity is out from underneath bank regulators?","Paul Idzik","Rich, irrespective of where the brokers said. We will always be having constructive discussions with our regulators to make sure that they\u2019re comfortable with whatever they might do with the business, with our business model or anything else. So \u2013 and we don\u2019t intend to change wanting to have that type relationships, so it doesn\u2019t really in practice change that very much at all.","Rich Repetto","Okay. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Congrats on the movement forward you\u2019ve made here in the quarter. Thanks.","Matthew Audette","Kind of you. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Alex Blostein","Hey, great. Good afternoon, guys. So just picking up on the last topic, maybe we can spend a minute kind of dissecting the opportunities now that we have the kind of hold co excess cash and then there is the bank. So I guess on the hold co level maybe help us understand a little bit, what are the constraints for your guys to use that excess cash which I guess you guys define is about $500 million performer for the transfer, you have to ask the regulator for any additional approval for either buyback or debt repurchase? Does the Tier 1 leverage at the hold co level come into effect and so that\u2019s the first part of the question?","Paul Idzik","Yes. We would need to get regulatory approval. And as I said even if that wasn\u2019t a formal requirement, it something that we would do as a matter of how we like to run the business, we have not only have leverage ratio requirements at the hold co, but we also will continue to have that leverage ratio requirement at the bank and that \u2013 both of those ratios will be carefully examined by us to make sure that we maintain the appropriate leverage ratios as expected by the regulators prior to us even thinking about doing it.","Alex Blostein","Got you. And then, so the second part of the question moving on to the bank piece, so 9.2 perform -- the transfer to your point a little above 9, but even with the new methodology you guys I think will be generating excess capital at the bank kind of over and above the dividend because of the DTA utilization? And that obviously without even kind of gong to you even lower target as you guys have outlined before. So maybe spend a minute on how we should think about utilization of that excess capital at the bank?","Matthew Audette","Sure, Alex, so you summarize it well, if history is a guy who will still be generating a little bit more capital at the bank and go in that ratio. I think there\u2019s a couple of things to think through, both of which go back to balance sheet side. First is the point I highlighted in the prepared remarks, our balance sheet really didn\u2019t grow during the year, because of all the customer net buying, nearly 8 billion of customer net buying. You typically would not have that amount, right. So when I think about capital utilization you\u2019re going to have \u2013 if things return to normal level you\u2019re going to have natural bias up on balance sheet side.","And then second to the comments we\u2019ve made and Paul highlighted in early question, our ability to bring deposits back on balance sheet, we\u2019re going to get to a place in the next couple of months, customer activity driving the amount, deposits that are in balance sheet, transitioning to \u2013 we can effectively the size very quickly with good precision or how much deposits to put back on balance sheet. That combined with having explicit Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9%. Those two things together I think will give us comfort. And to bring those deposits back on balance sheet versus where we\u2019ve been for the last few quarters, we\u2019ve been running while below that 50 billion mark to have a much bigger buffer.","So I think deposits back on balance sheet is one of the primary things, but just reiterating few of the other things that we highlighted in the prepared remarks where we\u2019ll be looking at things like those making sure we\u2019re following the loan portfolio, things like the wholesale funding, all the things we\u2019ve talked about before we will continue to analyze.","Alex Blostein","Got it. And you guys will be \u2013 and again where we talked about balance sheet side is total consolidated basis, right? So like you guys are at $46 or so billion dollars right now. So I know the comfortable going up almost to the $50 billion level, that the way would you characterize that?","Matthew Audette","Yes. It\u2019s definitely consolidated balance sheet. And then when thinking through bringing deposits back on as wholesale funding runs off that creates capacity to bring deposits back on without increasing balance sheet size.","Alex Blostein","Yes. Make sense. And just last one from me. And I think you mentioned both of these numbers, but I just want to be sure we get it right. When we think about the actual just capital generation now at the bank sub and the broker dealer sub, what are those two numbers now? I know you said, kind of with respective the dividend that you would have paid but just from a capital generation perspective would be helpful just to get those two numbers?","Matthew Audette","Yes. Sure. We did pro forma of 2014. It will be 225 from the bank and 200 from brokers. So, 425 total.","Alex Blostein","Got it. So that\u2019s capital generation, got it. Okay. Wonderful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please proceed.","Steven Chubak","Good evening and congratulations to really exciting news.","Paul Idzik","Thank you.","Steven Chubak","So just first one is quick on the capital side, now I was hoping you could verify where the Basel III ratio stands today, and potential dissect the benefit from the DTA side and also where the assets as well as RWAs sit?","Matthew Audette","Yes. On RWA when you look at our risk weighted ratios there incredibly high and only going higher. So they\u2019re not going to be \u2013 I\u2019d be quite surprised if they are constraints. So what we focus on the leverage side and I think we don\u2019t have the numbers completed. I just pick these to give you some directional direction on those numbers. So as the parent there\u2019s two things going on. The trust preferred securities will be coming out of capital, 75% in 2015 and then the remainder in 2016.","And then on the DTA side, there\u2019ll be a larger amount of DTA will be included in capital. When I put those two things together, the DTA being a positive and the trust preferred being a negative, but we estimate the net impact of that is going to be an increase to that leverage ratio as the parent. Not dramatic, but an increase. Down at the bank there is the impact of the trust, there is no impact of the trust. So the primary driver down at the bank is going to be the deferred tax asset. Now the deferred tax assets overall around to $1 billion, $600 million, that roughly $600 million of that is down at the bank and I would say broadly $300 half of that $600 million included in capital today.","So when I think through look at the Max increase of DTA could have down at the bank, it would be another $300 million. So I think that \u2013 that always give you some direction on what benefit we would expect under Basel III.","Steven Chubak","Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. And then switching over to the expense side, you guided to low single-digit growth for 2015 and I appreciate the color on the incremental cost build that we expect just relating to regulatory in compliance related matters. How should we\u2019ll be thinking about that balance in terms of what\u2019s striving the growth to the extent that it\u2019s investing in revenue generating activities versus regulatory cyber security and other related functions which are simply part of the new normal?","Paul Idzik","We\u2019ve \u2013 that\u2019s a fair question and we\u2019ve been pretty clear where we\u2019ve been investing and that would be the same in 2015 which is investing more and improving the client experience they have at E*TRADE and that involves customer facing professionals as well as spending more on technology. There is no doubt that there has been tremendous shift and the bar been raised on the whole cyber front and so we are absolutely investing in that as well as make it sure that the networks we operate, the way we control and manage data is state-of-art and so we\u2019re investing there as well. So those would be the three places where you\u2019d see headcount added. And then as Matthew mentioned, we\u2019ll invest in marketing as it make sense and as we can be focused in order to drive the type of customer numbers you saw in the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to continue to think about investing as well as keeping an eye on what\u2019s happening in the revenue line so that we can protect our margins.","Steven Chubak","Thanks. And just last one from me. When thinking about managing to a specific capital constraint at the parent, is 9% can be the same Tier 1 leverage bar that you\u2019re going to be managing to in terms of how much capital you have available for deployment and could that potential evolve overtime?","Matthew Audette","Well, we don\u2019t have a specific ratio there, but I think when you factor in our goal of getting down to a $1 billion of debt, right, inherently there\u2019s going to be some double leverage which means the parent ratio would be something less than 9%. So other than that directionally we don\u2019t have an explicit ratio that we\u2019re focus on yet.","Steven Chubak","Okay. But we shouldn\u2019t be looking at something like the well capitalized threshold which is clearly much lower around \u2013 we just 5% actually that\u2019s impose by the regulators as being the bar that you would manage to.","Matthew Audette","Well, I\u2019m sure every financial institution enjoy being able to go down to that level and I\u2019d be surprise if any of us could.","Steven Chubak","Fair enough. Congrats again and thanks for taking my questions.","Paul Idzik","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Michael Carrier","Thanks guys. Hey, Matt, just on the balance sheet, when we think about what you\u2019re talking about for the net interest spread for 2015 \u2013 just that guidance, are you assuming that kind of new plan is place and should we\u2019ll be thinking like low single-digit would be normal growth of client cash balances move more normal meaning it\u2019s not as much buying activity into the market?","Matthew Audette","You were talking about the spread guidance.","Michael Carrier","Yes. I mean, when you gave the spread guidance, are you assuming in that, that you have a more kind of normal level of client, your cash moving relative to what happened in 2014?","Matthew Audette","Yes. So, the answer is no. The spread guidance was more \u2013 was less guidance that was more as we sit here in a more difficult environment today, which is not \u2013 only a few weeks removed from Q4 and even each time I\u2019ll do a calculation on the impacts of the yield curve is as I\u2019m doing the calculation, rates move dramatically in that hour. So it\u2019s more just to highlight if the environment were at this moment the impact that environment would have. There\u2019s not a forecast on any other changes that we make including the deposits on balance sheet.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Got it. And then just as a follow-up, I don\u2019t know if you give us any update on what you\u2019re seeing in the HELOC portfolio. I know in the past you\u2019ve given some metrics, maybe then you didn\u2019t give them just because nothing has really change, there wasn\u2019t many thing to bring up but in terms of any other payment rates that you\u2019re seeing among customers, just any update there?","Matthew Audette","No I mean the high level stuff Mike I think would be helpful. I mean the most the primary things we are focused on are the home equities converting from interest only to advertising. I think everybody knows very little of that has occurred so far, the majority that happens in 2016 another $1 billion and then $600 million in 2015, so we\u2019ve had very little occur so far.","But for the amounts that have occurred so far, if you just look at from a quarter to quarter basis our delinquency metrics, our actual losses all these things continue here to be stable or improved. So we set the high level on what we see going on there keeping in mind again as small balances, they are the oldest vintages that have come through, so it\u2019s the better quality stuff. And beyond that I wouldn\u2019t really highlight anything going on in the portfolio other than we continue to focus on and to drop movements.","Michael Carrier","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Harris","Thanks, hey guys. So another one real quick on the capital, under the old plan there is the goal of stepping the bank down to 8% alternately. You\u2019ve got this restructuring going on that you have announced today. Does that 8% bogie and you are kind of completely off the table for the interim or is that possibly a target you could look to seek in about a year or two\u2019s time?","Paul Idzik","We\u2019ve been consistent if that\u2019s the target we are shooting for. We\u2019ll continue to aim that way if we change that we\u2019ll let you know. It\u2019s a target that we will continue to have discussion and dialogue with our regulators and as things continue in that wane we will update you if there are any reports.","Chris Harris - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, fair enough. A follow up question on your loan portfolio, this might be a little tough question to answer, but have you guys done any stress testing on that portfolio as to whether there are any concentrations in areas that might have a negative impact from falling energy prices, just wondering if there\u2019s anything that\u2019s in concentration in areas like Texas or similar places.","Matthew Audette","Sure. I mean not specific to drop in falling oil prices but it being subject to the stress testing process or \u2013 process, we definitely stress the loan portfolio. As far as concentrations go, our portfolio was build by us buying in the secondary market meaning our concentrations are pretty consistent with where our mortgages simply reside in America, which means our biggest concentration by far is California, then New York and things like that. So there\u2019s nothing you need to oil or anything that we would be concerned about.","Chris Harris","Got it. Thank you very much.","Matthew Audette","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please proceed.","Devin Ryan","Hey, thank you, good afternoon and congratulations on the great news today. Most of my questions were asked just have a couple of clean ups here. So following up on the loan resets and thinking about just the next couple of years, are there any months here kind of in this year that $700 million is going to amortize where it\u2019s concentrated just as we are looking towards that and then and of a bigger chunk into next year is that front end loaded or backend loaded, so I\u2019m assuming that would impact kind of the 12-month look through for provisioning [ph] ","Matthew Audette","So while you can imagine\u2026.","Paul Idzik","$600 million\u2026","Matthew Audette","Yes, so $650 million in\u2026","Paul Idzik","For $700 in total right.","Matthew Audette","$650 million and a $1 in 60 [ph] so $1.6 billion that\u2019s going to start to amortize. While it\u2019s not exactly split by every quarter, I said there is nothing dramatic that one quarter is incredibly low and another quarter is incredibly high. But it\u2019s not the same every quarter but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything I would highlight on be aware of this quarter or that quarter.","Devin Ryan","Okay fair enough. And then just on the fees and sort of service, nice pick up from the prior quarter and I think I heard [Indiscernible] a little bit higher but is there anything else in there that\u2019s it seasonal or should we think about this as a reasonable starting point.","Matthew Audette","It\u2019s a reasonable starting point. The biggest item in there is payments for order flow and the second biggest item is basically recurring fee income whether it be from our managed products or from our mutual funds and as balances continue to grow with those amounts continue to grow as well. It\u2019s up to roughly $12 million a quarter now, so that\u2019s the nature of that stuff is pretty consistent and should grow we will hope will grow overtime and then everything else in there is pretty small, so those are the two bigger buckets.","Devin Ryan","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Allen with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Allen","Evening guys. Just on the NIM outlook obviously SEC lending has been the key driver and we talked about it kind of coming back down, are we talking about more towards the levels that we saw in back half of 2013 or early 2014 and anything to think about in terms of the securities portfolio moving forward or current kind of run rate just kind of stay where those we expect to kind of roll a bit to given where we are seeing the yield curve right now.","Paul Idzik","So on the stock loan side, I think if you look at the yield table in the release it was \u2013 on the stock borrower side it was north of 20% yield. I would say where we are today is probably something north of 10% right it\u2019s comes back in a pretty big way. And again this stuff is very volatile. There is no way to know whether it goes down from here or returning back to the Q4 level tomorrow. Right, it could move pretty quickly, but that\u2019s where it is at the moment.","On the security side, I think the primary driver there is going to be assuming the balance sheet grows which means we would be buying securities. What the interest rate environment look like? Then specifically what the interest rate environment look like where we buy bonds which is more in the belly of the curves. When you look at the tenure coming down in a big way in Q4 well the belly of the curve didn\u2019t move much at all, so it didn\u2019t have a huge impact on things versus the last two or three weeks the three to five year point of the curve moved down in a pretty big way. So it all depends on where that plays out and how much balance sheet growth we have, what drives whether or not to be a meaningful change in security yields going forward.","Christopher Allen","Got it. And just I mean on the balance sheet growth topic, I mean is there is some way to think about it in terms of maybe accelerated deposits and is the 9.2% adjusted tier 1 ratio plus the potential of the 300 million from Basel III is that kind of the key leverage ones that will increase your deposits in banks balance sheet specifically.","Matthew Audette","Yes, I mean that was the $300 million was a just a range the potential benefit of the DTA. When we think through in 2015 and managing to the 9%, yes, we will be subject to Basel III then. So if there is a positive impact there would be capacity, would be capital capacity and growing the balance sheet could be one of the potential options there.","Christopher Allen","Thanks. And just one last question, you are also considering paying down your wholesale debt would the excess cash you have on here is that one of your latter options?","Matthew Audette","Yes, so when we think through over the long term the things that we want to accomplish, running off the wholesale book is an objective, running off the loan portfolio is an objective. So sitting here today we have no plans to change that natural run off, but we are always analyzing and looking to see if that dynamic changes, so where we sit today, no plans to do that, but we are always analyzing it.","Christopher Allen ","Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Brian Patel with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Brian Patel","Hi good evening folks, congrats also on the outcome. Just Matt and\/or Paul as you think about the long term implications of the excess capital aside from the additional DTA that comes back into the capital, have you modeled to what extent you think you will be generating more excess capital in this new structure versus the prior structure say over the next three or four years?","Matthew Audette","Yes we definitely look at it. I mean the thing I can highlight for you is more of the proforma of 2014 which I suspect you heard it, but just to repeat it. If we took a process we had in 2014 has generated the $300 million under the new structure it would be 425. So I don\u2019t have the guidance going forward but it also gives you an idea of the difference.","Brian Patel","Right, okay so I think it\u2019s helpful. And then just Paul, actually now if you want to talk a little bit about more about the mechanics of the cash management how quickly can you move balances between through deposits of balance sheet and on the balance sheet is there something you can do pretty much into the quarter or is there is time lag to that?","Matthew Audette","So where we sit today it\u2019s a little bit difficult and time consuming to do it. There is a bunch of different buckets, there\u2019s deposit for third party banks, there\u2019s deposit and money funds and there\u2019s a bunch of different processes and procedures to do that. Overtime, as we implement this new program we will have much more control to move it back on the balance sheet quite quickly. And so as we put that in place I think we\u2019ll be in a position in future quarters to walk you through with more specificity at our works. But just know that it will put us in a position to act faster in the future.","Brian Patel ","Okay, great. And then you just lastly just Paul you mentioned a lot of technology improvements that you\u2019ve worked on all year, I guess maybe just to frame what you think, how that might improve your organic growth rate and you\u2019ve been growth in DARTS as the year progresses, obviously the macro environment determines a lot more from that. But do you see it a sort of an inflection upward in organic growth has resulted in an initiative that you put in place.","Paul Idzik","Well certainly I\u2019m quite hopeful that we are taking the right steps to do that and I think we\u2019re just starting to see those shoots start to emerge in Q4. This is a retail business and accretion of new accounts and value related to those accounts takes a bit of time. And so we are feeling good about what we\u2019ve done and we are hearing good things from our customers and anything we do to improve the experience and engage them more has historically led to higher account values and more activity of those customers. So, I just stick to my \u2013 what I said during the prepared remarks I\u2019m sanguine [ph] about our opportunities.","Brian Patel","Okay, great thanks very much for taking my questions and congrats again.","Paul Idzik","Thanks a lot.","Operator","And we do have one final question, it comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Please proceed.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","Hey thanks for squeezing me in. So my question would be how close an eye do you guys keep on the conversation about potentially raising the 50 cap? And if it were changed, how much change of calculus in terms of potential capital uses?","Paul Idzik","We stay pretty close to that discussion, Patrick and without getting too snappy or reply on this one, the \u2013 it would absolutely just reduce some of the anxiety we have about going over 50, and so would just make those economics more attractive in the mix of all the other things we are doing in determining how to create value, paying down debt, returning capital to the shareholders, investing in the business, bringing deposits and all those things go in the mix. If 50 were to move up and quite frankly I think it should move up, that would just make it easier to look at that without some of the ambiguity of estimating the complete economics.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","Great. I appreciate it.","Paul Idzik","Thank you, Pat.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time. Mr. Idzik, I\u2019ll turn it back to you for any final remarks.","Paul Idzik","Thank you very much all of you for spending some time with us this evening as a lot to announce and thank you for your attention and feel really good about what we had to say today, so thank you and have a good evening.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the call for today.

Good evening. It's a pleasure to be here for my first quarterly earnings call with E*TRADE. Given I've been here a total of 3 days, you won't hear much from me by way of commentary on our business and results. I would like to share a few thoughts on the attraction of E*TRADE. The moment I was contacted by the search committee of E*TRADE's board, I've been doing my own due diligence on the company. What really excites me about this company are: First, its iconic and enduring brand. This company has done an impressive job building a recognized name for itself and a reputation for great customer service. Second, it's a great business model, bouncing along in an unfavorable environment. As with any investment opportunity, the best time to enter is when things are well positioned for greatness, but not there yet. In the case of E*TRADE, the brokerage model and opportunity is vast, but suppressed by external factors. As you can tell, investor confidence is low, and so are volumes. And the interest rate environment has compressed the spread a depository can generate on customers' cash. While it's impossible to forecast macroeconomic normalization, and live through the ebbs and flows of past cycles, and while this one will likely last longer than most, I believe the economy will improve, confidence will return and this company will capitalize on those improvements. So I think it's a great time for E*TRADE and I'm extremely excited to be part of the team. I look forward to getting further up to speed on the company in the coming days and months, getting to know its employees, and speaking with you in more detail on future calls.","With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Matthew.","Matthew J. Audette","Thank you, Paul. 2012 was an important year for E*TRADE. We completed the transition to our new regulators. We formalized a strategic and capital plan centering on the most efficient path to unlocking value for shareholders. We refinanced our highest cost corporate debt, replacing it with the lowest coupons the company has ever issued. We advanced through an exhaustive efficiency and cost-cutting exercise, identifying over $100 million of cost reductions for implementation in 2013. We made significant investments and enhancements to our enterprise risk management capabilities. We made great progress on reducing our loan portfolio and the associated risks, further positioning ourselves for strong profitability and more normalized earnings. And the core brokerage franchise continue to grow and improve, outpacing the account and asset growth from the past several years.","I'll share additional details and thoughts on each of those items, but first I'd like to review the results of the brokerage business, the heart of this company. During a year characterized by global macro economic uncertainty, domestic political uncertainty and an ever-approaching fiscal cliff, we are proud of our successes in the core brokerage business. Our brokerage account growth outpaced our growth over the past 3 years, with more than 120,000 net new accounts. And we kept more of those accounts on board with account retention at an all-time high. A similar story in brokerage assets. Net new assets into the firm were at their highest annual level since we began tracking the metric in 2007. Not bad, and all during a year when the retail investor largely remained on the sidelines, as evidenced by lower trading activity than we have seen in 6 years. Waning investor confidence and a 5-year low in volatility contributed to the 12% decline to 138,000 Daily Average Revenue Trades for the full year. For the fourth quarter, in particular, DARTs of 128,000 were down 9% year-over-year, but were down less than 1% sequentially.","As of this afternoon, our January to-date trends are reflective of some rebound, though it's too early to tell if investors are truly returning to the market in a meaningful way. Month-to-date, our DARTs are tracking 17% above December levels. Net new brokerage assets for the year of $10.4 billion were up from $9.7 billion in 2011, and represent a growth rate of 7%. Our net new brokerage accounts for the year of 120,000 are also well above the 99,000 we recorded in 2011. This is partially a result of fewer accounts leaving us as we improved our attrition rate to a record low of 9% for 2012. Our successes in improving customer service and expanding awareness around our product offering are reflected in this metric. Considering attrition levels were historically in the mid-teens, this is an area of great pride, but also of continued focus for improvement. Beyond brokerage accounts, our Corporate Services group brought on more Stock Plan accounts than we have seen in any year of the company's history. With the acquisition of 65 new clients during the year, we added 77,000 net new accounts, more than triple the amount added during 2011. We have made a number of enhancements to our retirement and investing offering over the past year, including placing certified retirement planning counselors in nearly every branch, complementing our call center presence. We launched one-stop rollover, providing customers with a simple way to move their 401(k) savings into a professionally-managed portfolio at E*TRADE. This was an important launch for us, as rollover assets represented about half of our net new retirement flows in 2012 and were up 70% versus 2011.","Our professionally-managed account solutions, which offer accessible entry points with a minimum of just $25,000 are an essential component of our suite of retirement and investing products and services, as we work to deepen engagement with our customer base, focused on expanding our share of our customers' wallet. Launched in early 2010, we have grown managed account assets from 0 to $1.3 billion in a fairly short period and ending 2012 at nearly double 2011.","Our financial consultant sales force has also been a key factor in our early success in the retirement and investing segment and for our managed accounts in particular. This group of 270 individuals accounted for 1\/3 of net new brokerage assets brought to E*TRADE during 2012, of which approximately 40% were retirement-based. Our net new retirement accounts of 26,000 in 2012 represented a 14% increase from last year, and is also a testament to the efforts of our FCs.","With respect to our customer offering, we made multiple improvements throughout the year, continuing our investment in the retail trading experience, including a complete revamp of our prospect and logged-in customer websites, a redesign of our bond resource center, the incorporation of new planning and education tools, as well as improvements to our active trader platform, to name a few. Mobile continues to be a crucial way to serve our customer base, as retail investors are increasingly disconnecting from desktop computing. During the year, we expanded our mobile offering to Windows Phone, bringing our total mobile platforms to 6. Within these 6 platforms, we made several upgrades and enhancements, including introducing mobile check deposit, voice-recognition, barcode scanning, educational videos and CNBC videos-on-demand. We just launched a redesigned platform for tablet users, which incorporates several new features, centered on research and analytics. The importance of having top-tier mobile access points is evidenced in our record mobile adoption rates, with 6.8% of our trades executed by a mobile in Q4, up from 5.3% a year ago. Our mobile platform was also featured as the #4 essential finance app in the Apple App Store this quarter, the only brokerage app to make the list.","A more sophisticated and educated customer, in conjunction with continued enhancements to our trading suite, is reflected in our mix of trades. Derivatives continue to be a growth part of our business in 2012, as our mix of option trades represented 24% of DARTs, up from 20% in 2011. This improvement was driven by complex option volume growth and success in short dated options. Derivatives as a percent of overall volume set a record in 2012.","All of these elements: the Service, the platform, the tools and the education drive at the heart of our focus to empower our customer base to achieve their financial objectives, whether in retirement, investing or trade. Giving our customers capabilities, knowledge and advice, when and where they need it, has not gone unnoticed. The hard work and commitment of our employees earned us the #1 ranking in Kiplinger's Annual Best of the Online Brokers survey, the only firm to receive 5-star ratings in both customer service and investment choice categories. Among the other third party recognition awards received in 2012, our customer offering was recognized by SmartMoney, receiving top marks in the trading tools and research categories, and by Barron's, earning top marks in portfolio analysis and research. Both firms also recognized our customer service as one of the best in the industry.","Turning to our financial results. For the fourth quarter, we reported a net loss of $186 million or a $0.65 loss per share. This included a couple unique items. First, a $257 million pretax charge related to our $1.3 billion refinance of corporate debt, equating to approximately $0.59 per share. Second, our tax benefit included approximately $38 million of expense, or $0.13 per share, related primarily to a recent change to the California Tax Code. For the full year, we reported a net loss of $113 million, a $0.39 loss per share, compared with net income of $157 million or $0.54 per share in 2011.","Our fourth quarter net revenues were $468 million, inclusive of deleveraging-related securities gains. Revenues were down from $490 million in the third quarter, which also included deleveraging-related gains, and down from $475 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Revenues included net interest income of $260 million, a sequential decline of $0.5 million as a result of 10 basis points in net interest spread expansion, offset by a $2 billion reduction in the average balance sheet size. Net interest spread rose to 238 basis points for the quarter, leading to a full year spread of 239 basis points, consistent with our expectations. The improvement to our spread this quarter was driven primarily by deleveraging, as we reduced balance sheet cash held in Q3, commensurate with our targeted reduction of liabilities. We additionally benefited from lower wholesale funding cost and the full quarter impact of rate cuts made on customer deposits of 1 basis point for the majority of our cash products.","Assuming no changes to the current rate environment and our current balance sheet strategy, we continue to expect our average spread in 2013 to compress 10 basis points from 2012's average. Commissions, fees and service charges, principal transactions, and other revenue in the fourth quarter were $151 million, down 1% from the third quarter and down 3% from the same quarter of 2011. Average commission per trade was $11.10, down from $11.24 last quarter, as a result of more trades from active traders on a relative basis. For the full year, average commission per trade was flat at $11.01.","Revenue this quarter also included $62 million of net gains on loans and securities inclusive of deleveraging-related gains, as we sold securities to match a reduction in certain wholesale funding obligations. Our legacy loan portfolio ended the quarter at $10.6 billion, a contraction of $557 million during the quarter, and is now down 68% from its size at the peak. We expect that loan runoff will average approximately $450 million per quarter through 2013, generally consistent with the 4% to 5% quarterly decline we have experienced for quite some time.","Provision for loan losses for the quarter was $74 million, down from $141 million in the prior quarter. The sequential decline related primarily to the prior quarter's charge of $50 million related to charge-offs associated with newly-identified bankruptcy filings. We continue to expect provision to trend downward over the long term, though there can be variability in any given quarter.","Total net charge-offs in the quarter were $102 million, down from $158 million in the prior quarter, which again included $50 million related to newly-identified borrower bankruptcies. The total allowance for loan losses ended the quarter at $481 million, a sequential decline of $28 million. The $481 million reserve includes a specific reserve of $171 million for modified loans. Our coverage remains relatively constant for non-modified loans, with this quarter's allowance covering 76% of 90-plus day loans past due. This compares to 72% last quarter. For modified loans, our total expected losses remain flat from the prior quarter at 37%. Our specific allowance of $171 million for modified loans, plus prior write downs, continues to cover the total expected losses in this portfolio.","During the quarter, we modified $44 million of loans, down from $54 million in the prior quarter, and representing the lowest quarterly level of modifications since we began the program in 2009. We continue to expect quarterly modification volumes to trend downward as the population of delinquent loans continues to get smaller. One important note on our reported metrics. Starting in the fourth quarter, we began to report loans in the process of bankruptcy as TDRs, so the balances reflected in the tables are greater than the amount of modified loans. Delinquencies in the quarter were down on a total basis, but increased 5% sequentially in the 30 to 89 day category, driven by the 1-4 family portfolio. We attribute this largely to seasonality, as the fourth quarter is typically weaker with respect to borrower collections.","Based on data received to-date for January collection activity, we anticipate that the elevated 1-4 family delinquencies will improve in the near term. Operating expenses for the year were $1.2 billion, down 6% from the prior year, and in line with our expectations. Fourth quarter expenses of $285 million were down 1% sequentially and 6% from the prior year. Included in the quarter was approximately $7 million of professional services expenses related to utilizing outside consultants for our expense review.","Turning to our financial position. Corporate cash ended the quarter at $408 million, declining by only $23 million from Q3 levels, due to interest expense payments, partially offset by a $58 million dividend during the fourth quarter, equal to the capital associated with a bank charter that was liquidated as part of our deleveraging actions. I would note that corporate cash is often impacted by subsidiary tax payments and expense reimbursements, which can create volatility in individual quarters. However, over the long term, we expect corporate cash will decline in line with interest payments. Our current level of corporate cash represents more than 3.5 years' worth of debt service coverage, a ratio that was improved materially by our recently completed refinance. Our capital ratios improved at the bank across all measures during the quarter, with our constraining Tier 1 leverage ratio ending the year at 8.7%, up from last quarter's 7.9%, and progressing toward our plan of exceeding our target of 9.5% by the end of 2013.","For all other bank risk-based ratios, we were between 19% and 20%, well in excess of regulatory minimums. At the parent, our ratios declined slightly as a result of the loss related to our debt refinance. However, we ended the quarter with a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.5%, just 30 basis points below the prior quarter, despite the capital hit created by the refinance. Importantly, our capital generation at the parent will improve as a result of the refinance we completed. Our parent Tier 1 common ratio ended the quarter at 10.3%, and we estimate it will be approximately 50 basis points higher under the current Basel III proposed guidelines.","With regard to our strategic and capital plan, we made some important progress since its submission in Q2 of last year. This progress includes deleveraging our balance sheet, our $1.3 billion refinance of corporate debt, over $100 million of identified cost saves and the buildout of an enterprise risk management function. I'll now discuss each of these in more detail. First, on deleveraging. As we have stated in the past, we view this to be the most shareholder-friendly path toward growing our Tier 1 leverage ratio, which represents our most constraining ratio and is an important barometer in gauging our success against the plan we submitted to regulators. Given the nature of our balance sheet, in order to reduce assets, we must target reductions in our liabilities. And to that end, we completed a total of $4.9 billion in deleveraging actions in 2012. This includes $1.3 billion completed in the third quarter, and another $3.6 billion completed in the fourth quarter, which consisted of the following: $1.2 billion of sweep deposits transferred to a third-party, bringing our total sweep deposits transferred to date to $1.7 billion; approximately $1 billion of a reduction of FHLB advances, bringing the total amount of wholesale bonds actively reduced to date to $1.5 billion; $900 million of customer payables transferred to third-party money funds and $500 million of new customer cash directed to third-party money funds upon account opening, bringing the total to $800 million. Additionally, we have already completed another $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2013, consisting of: Approximately $100 million of customer payables converted to third-party money funds; and $1.3 billion of sweep deposits transferred to third-parties. This brings the total to $6.3 billion in completed deleveraging actions, falling squarely within our original target of $5 billion to $10 billion. Recall that the target is a wide range due to the uncertainty of customer activity and the impact of customer selling and buying on our balance sheet size. Given our current position, our plans are for total deleveraging actions of $8.5 billion, though that may change if cash balances change meaningfully.","One last point about our deleveraging efforts. I want to emphasize that the actions we have taken, with respect to customer deposits moved off balance sheet, are near-term tactics to achieve longer term capital goals. We have taken great pains not to disrupt our brokerage customers with these actions, as we fully recognize the value of maintaining these relationships and ultimately, these balances. Finally, in today's rate environment, the risk reward for maintaining a larger balance sheet is not exactly in favor of maintaining ours above its natural size, given that returns are at historical lows. For example, the incremental spread on a $1 invested today, considering our strategy of agency-backed investments, is approximately 1%. So in all, it's not a bad time to deleverage.","Now turning to our recently completed $1.3 billion refinance of corporate debt. In December, we eliminated the entirety of our 12.5% Springing Lien Notes due 2017 and the entirety of our 7 7\/8% notes due in 2015. I have to admit that feels really good to say. This was a major accomplishment and has been a priority for quite some time. The Springing Lien Notes had been issued at a point in time when our bank needed capital, which was reflected in the high coupon. They were also issued at a discount and carried unfavorable tax treatment, making the effective cost to us closer to 17%. The elimination of these notes on their first call date and the subsequent issuance of new notes with an effective cost of well under half that of the previous debt, marks an important progress for the company. We also took the opportunity in attractive credit market conditions to refinance our nearest maturity notes, removing a 2015 payment event at a 7 7\/8% coupon from our capital structure. Upon completion of the refinance, we had extended the weighted average maturity of our interest-bearing debt from approximately 4.7 years to around 6 years, and reduced the average coupons from 10.25% to 6.4%. I would also note that along with the principal amounts, we refinanced the associated call premiums and deal-related expenses, such that we did not use any of our corporate cash to complete the transaction. As far as impact on the financials, we reduced our annual interest expense from approximately $185 million pretax to $115 million pretax, representing an after-tax savings of approximately $60 million or $0.21 per share.","Considering we have eliminated a significant amount of nondeductible interest expense, we expect our tax rate going forward to improve to around 40%. Beyond being incredibly positive for shareholders, the refi also addresses an important component of our strategic and capital plan, which calls for us to reduce our interest expense and eventually, our overall debt burden. The newly-issued notes were designed with this goal in mind, including callability as early as the end of 2014, as we continue to work toward our goal of distributing capital from the bank to the parent at the end of 2013. While we will weigh all options for parent capital management when the time comes, our optimal capital structure has less corporate debt than we carry today. Therefore, we structured our new debt to accommodate any such actions without being overly punitive. $505 million is callable at the end of 2014 at half its annual coupon, and $800 million is callable in 2015 at 3\/4 its annual coupon. Moving to cost reductions. Last quarter, we raised our target for cost reductions to $100 million, at which point, $70 million had been identified. This quarter, we have identified the full $100 million and then some. Our target for cost reductions is now $110 million, and will be fully implemented by the end of the current calendar year. Within this $110 million, $30 million will come from marketing spend and the remaining $80 million will come predominantly through compensation and professional services. I would also note that we expect about half of this $80 million to come from technology and operations. We expect the cost of implementing these reductions to come in around $10 million in 2013.","For the fourth quarter, in addition to the $7 million in consultant fees that I highlighted earlier, we also recorded $4 million in restructuring cost, bringing the total onetime cost attributed to our cost save project to $11 million. Finally, regarding the buildout of our enterprise risk management capabilities, we are in the process of creating a structure that is appropriate for our size and complexity. We made significant progress on this front during 2012 and this will remain a top focus in 2013.","We expect the annual investment in this function to be $10 million, and we saw about $1 million of that flow through in 2012, with the vast majority expected in 2013. During the year, we made important new hires, including compliance personnel and internal auditors, and utilized external consultants. We also began engaging in systems upgrades. Just note this is incremental to our $110 million of identified cost saves, so you should think about the $100 million in net savings.","So to briefly summarize the year, we strengthened our financial position with a refinance of our highest cost debt and solid bank capital growth. We continued to reduce our legacy loan portfolio and the associated risk. We formalized and submitted a strategic and capital plan to the regulators and have made good progress executing against it. And we identified significant cost saves and efficiency gains to be realized over the current and coming quarters. And above all, our core brokerage business continues to execute well, growing accounts and assets at levels we haven't seen in quite some time, even in the face of a challenging environment. We still have much work to do, but I am proud of the things we accomplished in 2012 and look forward to building on those achievements this year. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Howard Chen from Credit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Matt, now that you have completed the refinancing actions and you're making meaningful progress on deleveraging, can you just outline for us what next steps the company has to take? And what we should expect to hear, if it's going to hit that timetable to achieve your goal of upstreaming bank capital by the end of the year?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure, sure, Howard. So the most measurable thing is going to be to continue to improve the Tier 1 leverage ratio at the bank, so our target is 9.5%, and to dividend capital above that towards the end of 2013. So that's the most visible thing you will see. But I think it's important to emphasize that a dividend is not something that you can simply do based on above 9.5%. All the things that are important and part of our plan, I think really need to come together for that to make sense. Meaning, we need to continue to build out enterprise risk management capabilities. We have to continue to mitigate and decrease the credit risk on the balance sheet. We need to implement the cost reductions. We need to do all those things. And I think from -- if we're able to execute on all of that, I feel like we would be in a good position for a dividend. But I'd be remiss if I didn't close with, I can't speculate on whether the regulators would agree with what I'm saying, but I feel confident, from our perspective, it's the right thing to focus on.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then you also noted in your comments, your outlook for provision expenses to decline over the longer term. But just given the loan book continues to burn down and you're pulling down reserves, why shouldn't provision expense be also down in 2013 versus what we just experienced in 2012?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure, Howard. So I think without getting precise on any individual quarter, which can be pretty choppy, I think our expectations are down over the long term. It's just something where, on a quarter-to-quarter basis, that may not be the case. So year-over-year, I certainly would expect a decline.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess the first question is on brokerage attrition. I know you've made great strides, Matt, when you look at the year-over-year numbers. But 4Q, at least by our calculations, ticked up, almost close to 10%. Was there anything going on in 4Q that's peculiar from the 8.5% or so run rate you've been on?","Matthew J. Audette","Nothing in particular, Rich. I think focusing on the year is really where to ground it. So we're 9% for the year, which is a record low for us. If you go back to last quarter, at 8.5%, I mean, that's one of the lowest numbers we've ever seen. So I think it's almost like -- well, I was just talking to Howard about provision, right? Attrition can bounce up and down, but I think we're really focused on we had a record low year. And we're not going to rest on our laurels on that. We are focused on improving it going forward as well.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Got it, got it. Okay. And then, Matt, the charges on the FHLB, paying down FHLB, the charges were much less than what we anticipated. You had charges, I think, it was around in the $50 million range and you only retired half of what you did this quarter. And this quarter, the charges were almost half. So I guess, can you explain, there's still $1.3 billion on the balance sheet, do you intend to pay more down and how would we think about the charges that you're going to have to offset through gains or whatever, on what's remaining, if you do that?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure, Rich. So for the $1.5 billion we've done to date, which is over the last 6 months, in our overall plans for deleveraging of $8.5 billion, we've completed the wholesale reductions that we were looking to do. So at this moment, we don't have any plans to further reduce that actively. Now over time, that roughly $5.5 billion, when you add in the repo that's left, will naturally decline over time. But we don't have any plans to actively -- to do anything else prepayment-wise, in that area.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And just to step back, the $28 million charge versus the like, $50 million, I think it was $52 million last quarter, or $51 million?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes, so why the difference in numbers?","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Yes.","Matthew J. Audette","So it just all depends on which ones you prepay, right? So for the very same reason that the $5.5 billion that's left, if we were to do it all, would come with a charge of north of $700 million, so it just depends on exactly which items that we terminated. They just have a different cost based on their coupons and the tenor that's leftover on the borrowing. So it's not something that you would have been able to predict.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And one last quick one, it'd be for Paul. What areas will you think your energy and your focus on, near term, as you get introduced to E*TRADE?","Paul Thomas Idzik","As I discussed with the board before I joined, my focus is going to be on ruthless execution of that strategic plan. That's what our shareholders are expecting. That's what the board is expecting, that's what we have the employees and my colleagues teed up to do. And it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out, that, that's where I'm going to spend my time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of follow-ups on the balance sheet, I guess. So $8.5 billion target total deleveraging, so I guess, I just want to double check, so for the rest of the year, we're looking at, I don't know, $2 billion to $3 billion of incremental deleveraging on top of, I guess, what you guys done in the first quarter, is that roughly the math?","Matthew J. Audette","That is, Alex, about $2 billion.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, when I think about...","Matthew J. Audette","Sorry, Alex. Sorry to jump in there. Alex, $2 billion beyond what I described that we have already done in Q1, so off of what we've done -- where we ended the year, is another $3 billion.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. I just wanted to double check that. And then when I look at the quarter, the fourth quarter, was there any timing difference, I guess, between when you guys broke the FHLB funding and sold some of the securities, because it feels like there is, from just looking at the average balances, seems like there was a little bit of a mismatch, so I just wanted to double check whether or not there was any kind of positive carry that you saw in the fourth quarter from that?","Matthew J. Audette","Not really, Alex. You can imagine, especially this particular quarter, with all the deleveraging actions that were going on, and all the customer flows, if you saw the -- if you noticed, on the monthly metrics that we put out as well, the net customer buying and selling, in the first 2 months of the quarter, there was a bunch of buying and then big selling in the month of December. So there was a lot of different things going on in the quarter. There wasn't something specific to when securities were sold, and when the FHLB advances were prepaid.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. Last one, on the balance sheet and then I'll move on. Do you guys have a sense of where the average earning assets actually ended the year? I know we know what the total balance is, but I was just hoping to get the earning assets?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes, I don't have that number for you, Alex. Sorry.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But is the, like the $3 billion swing that you saw in the ending balance sheet, is it kind of indicative for the average balances as well, then?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure. So the non-interest ones are not moving dramatically, so that's a good way to think about it.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And just moving on, I guess, to expenses. So it sounded like you guys identified a little bit more in expenses for 2013. When you think about the business, and I guess, in the opportunities and you clearly continue to see pretty decent new business momentum, what do you envision kind of like the core expense growth that you need to have in order to continue to drive organic growth? I guess, in other words, you guys did $285 million in expenses this quarter, at run rate, that leaves you at $260 million by the end of next year, but presumably, there's obviously some just core expense growth, how do you think about that for '13?","Matthew J. Audette","So in a short window like that, I think that taking that $290 million, which has historically been our run rate, which is a little bit above what we saw in the fourth quarter. And taking the $110 million of cost saves offset by the year-end investment of $10 million, so taking off $25 million per quarter, that $260 million to $265 million range, I think is a good way to think about it. Embedded in that number is still a continued amount of investment in the firm. So I talked about $110 million of cost saves and about $40 million of that coming from our tech and ops area. Keep in mind, that's one of our biggest areas where we spend money, so reducing it by $40 million, we're still doing a significant amount of investment, on an annual basis, in those reduced cost numbers. So in the short term, I wouldn't think that there's -- I wouldn't view it as an upward bias that we need to increase the expense base to invest. I think in our baseline numbers we're talking about, we're still investing.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. And just a last one for me. I guess, when you look at net new assets for December, pretty big pickup, I was wondering if you could quantify how much was the dividends? And then, more broadly, I was wondering if you have any stats on, I guess, where you see the growth coming from, whether it's competitors, so are you winning some business from either one of the other online brokers, or some other trend that continues to kind of drive your net new asset growth?","Matthew J. Audette","So I don't have a breakout of the dividends for the month of December, Alex, other than, if you just look at the 3 months of the quarter, we saw nice improvement, October, November, December, the net new assets were growing throughout the quarter. So I think we saw a nice trend there. As far as where we're getting the new customers or new accounts from, it really hasn't changed. I don't think there's a dramatic change within our space of customers going from us to our competitors and back. I really think it's the secular shift from the wirehouses and the off-line to the online space. And I think that trend is what continued in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Weyeneth from Sterne Agee.","Jason Weyeneth - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","The home equity book continues to see pretty rapid principal paydowns. In thinking about the home equity conversions that are starting in 2015, you guys have talked about that $150 to $200 average increase in minimum payments? But can you give us any sense as to how that compares to what the average home equity borrower might currently be paying, given clearly, many are paying above the minimums?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure, Jason. So I don't have precise data what their normal monthly payments are. I think you see in the home equity book, you certainly see that the charge-offs that are driving that number down. And typically, the vast majority of principal payments are going to be prepayments of the loans themselves. I don't have anything, any specific breakout there for you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Joel Jeffrey with KBW.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","So just to go back to your ability to return capital. I know you've talked in the past about, when you get to that 9.5% level, being able to start to return some of this back from the bank. You're currently at 8.7%. If you were to achieve the 9.5% earlier than expected, is there anything that holds you back from beginning the capital return before 2014?","Matthew J. Audette","So Joel, we definitely need approval from our regulators. And I think the things that are important for us to even be comfortable going to ask for a dividend are more than just being above 9.5%. So they are executing on our risk -- enterprise risk management buildout, they're improving our credit quality, they're executing on the cost reductions. It's really the entire plan coming together to get us to a point where we think it would make sense to go and make that request. Our plans are towards the end of 2013 to do that. But it's incredibly important to make sure that we execute on that plan, and not just increase our Tier 1 leverage ratio. We need to do everything.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. And then, you guys also mentioned that $8.5 billion was your target, sort of deleveraging number. Can you talk about any kind of circumstances that would cause you to vary off of that, whether taking it to $10 billion or actually reducing it in any way?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure. So the biggest factor is going to be customer activity. So when customers are big net sellers, they go from some positions that are off balance sheet into cash that's on balance sheet, which would naturally drive the balance sheet up, which would then necessitate us doing more deleveraging. So that's why we have that big range of $5 billion to $10 billion. So given where we are today, and assuming that customers don\u2019t meaningfully move the balance sheet up or down, we're targeting $8.5 billion. Now if customers are big net sellers and put cash in the balance sheet, we have to do more than $8.5 billion. And the reverse is also true, if there are big net buyers, like we saw in the months of October and November, we probably don\u2019t need $8.5 billion, so it really just depends on what the customers do.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Keith Murray with Nomura.","Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just some color on the economics around the third-party deposits, meaning, what are the economics there? What do you lose on a net basis, when you do the sweep to the third-party?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. So you can imagine the economics there are pretty small, right, everyone's flushed with deposits. So for us, it's more about a balance sheet strategy. And the fee that we get paid from those third-parties are pretty nominal or pretty small.","Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, at a similar vein, given that deleveraging leads to sort of a reduced earnings profile, at least in the short term, is there any risk of your DTA needing to have a valuation allowance, in your mind?","Matthew J. Audette","So we're quite comfortable that we don't need a valuation allowance on the DTA. I think, specific to deleveraging, keep in mind that the marginal investment rates we have in this environment, with our investment strategy, we're talking about 100 basis points. So it's not a dramatic amount that we're giving up. Also keep in mind, certain deleveraging strategies, like the wholesale reduction and like the customer payables, to the extent we have those in excess of margin, those deposits are invested in segregated cash, where you earn single-digit basis points on it. And after FDIC insurance, we're, on that particular one, we're actually losing money. So there is actually some deleveraging that makes us money by deleveraging, there's some that's kind of neutral and then there's some like sweeps that are costly, but the cost is in that marginal investment range of 100 basis points. So it's not something that I'm concerned about from a valuation allowance perspective at all.","Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And then just a final one on securities gains. Last couple of quarters, obviously, you've taken sizable gains to offset some of the impacts on the wholesale borrowing declines. How should we think about sort of the pipeline of potential securities gains going forward? I know you've talked about it coming down over time in the past, but do you see the pace of that increasing as a result of the recent actions?","Matthew J. Audette","So specific to Q3 and Q4, they were most certainly elevated. One thing I would do is I would look at the securities gains and impairments and also net of the losses on the retirement of FHLB advances which are reported in a different line. So when you look at all those things together, the net number for the last couple of quarters bounced around the $25 million -- the upper $20 million range, which is somewhat consistent with what we've seen throughout this year. I think, over the long term, even those numbers, in the mid to upper 20s, are going to come down. But I don't have a specific number for you.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Chris Allen with Evercore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I might have missed this, but I was just wondering if you could give us an update in terms of what has already been realized in the expense reductions, because there's been a somewhat gradual decline in expenses, looking at the starting point for 2012. And if you could give us a kind of a framework in terms of how it's going to progress. I know you guys gave us the numbers, but is there gradual progression or are there some things that need to be executed for more of a stair step drop-down?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. So you didn't miss it. I didn't give it. But I'll do that now. So Of the $110 million, we had about $15 million of it was in our fourth quarter results. And on the ER investment side, the $10 million investment, about $1 million of that was in our fourth quarter results. So about a small amount, net $14 million, were in the fourth quarter results. Our objective is to complete the majority of the actions to realize the $110 million by the end of the second quarter, meaning beginning in the third quarter of 2013, the majority of it would be embedded in our results. And then to complete all of it by the end of the year, meaning, in Q1 2014, all of it is in our results, so that's our plans on timing.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So let's assume you have the happy situation where you reach your capital target at the bank and you're ready to upstream capital to the parent. What realistically can you do in the near term with the capital to parent? Is the thought that you'd just kind of stockpile it there until you're able to prepay the debt or are there kind of other options that you would consider using with that money?","Matthew J. Audette","So I'd definitely love to have that problem, Patrick. So I think we'd make the decision at that time, of what was the best use of that cash for our shareholders, right, so you can run the gamut of the obvious choices, is there anything we can do on the debt, even though it's not callable. Is there anything in our business that would make sense to invest in. Can and should we return it to shareholders. So I think we'd make the thing that was in the best interest of our shareholders at that time. Keeping in mind that certain of those options would need regulatory approval and others wouldn't. So there'd be a lot of things to consider when we're in that situation.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's fair. And then one for Paul. So Paul, obviously, you have a background at Barclays and then I think, more recently, at a brokerage firm over in the U.K. What's your background level on the online brokerage business? How familiar are you with it? And do you think there's a learning curve that you have to come up here? Or are you pretty much ready to go and you feel like you have a pretty good grasp of the competitive dynamics?","Paul Thomas Idzik","Well, as you might well imagine, with a degree from Our Lady's University, I'm pretty well prepared for anything.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes, everything except for winning the ballgame.","Paul Thomas Idzik","Yes, I understand, but I thought you'd like that. But seriously, when I was at Barclays Capital, oversaw the installation of BARX, which is one of the most successful corporate side for electronic brokering platforms that you've seen and really helped us move the dial. When I went to Barclays, we made great strides in electronic brokerage at Barclays Stockbrokers, which is the leading execution-only stockbroker in the U.K. And so I think, with particular questions about the retail electronic brokerage space, there's also some real value having helped run a branch network of red-blooded retail customers. And so I think there's a number of things. And the other thing is, we have a great team here and I would say it's not a one-man band.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Another question on the deleveraging here. It sounds like pretty much all of it this year is going to come from customer deposits. I know we kind of danced around this a little bit, on a answer to an earlier question, but I wonder if you can be a little bit more precise on what the average yield you expect to lose on the asset side associated with these liabilities?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure, Chris. So we certainly are focused on doing customer deposits for the rest of the year. I think, if you look, just look at the balance sheet, the reduction of customer payables, which I said, we had already done about $100 million in the first quarter of this year, that's the type of stuff that comes out of the segregated cash, which, in effect, is an asset where we net lose money when you factor in the FDIC insurance that we have to pay. The rest of it would likely be sweep, and that's where our loss opportunity, if you will, is going to be the marginal investment rate of around 100 basis points. So that's the best way I can probably direct you on that stuff.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then with respect to customer activity, you guys aren't alone at seeing DARTs kind of being, I'm sure, below where you'd like to see them. What do you guys think it's really going to take to get the retail investor a little bit more active here? I mean, we'd heard in the past that the holdup being the election, and that's done. And then all of sudden, it was the fiscal cliff was the problem and that's over. Just wondering if you guys have any perspective on why now folks aren't trading more. I mean is it the situation with the debt, with the government. And I guess, if that's the case, we can be waiting for kind of a long time until we see a little bit more normal activity. Maybe if you can comment a little bit about that, it'd be great.","Matthew J. Audette","Sure. So I think it's the things that you just listed out. So the retail investor hates uncertainty, right? So certainty is something that we think would generally encourage more trading. And the things that you highlighted, the election, fiscal cliff, which is really, the can's been kicked down the road as opposed to solved, are things that we think make those folks nervous so they pull back and they don't trade. I'd reiterate what we've seen so far in January, which is up 17% over December, which puts us just north of 150,000 trades per day. Higher, in general, levels, that if they continue, which who knows if they will, are the highest levels we've seen in a year. So we're seeing some good things in the past few weeks, but we'll have to see how it plays out.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then last question for me. On the dividend potential out of the bank, how do you guys get comfortable with persuading the regulators that you can really have that dividend when you have a lot of your HELOC portfolio that's going to be switching to amortizing? I mean, do you think they're going to be comfortable with a dividend out of the bank prior to seeing what kind of loss expectations happen in that portfolio once we start getting some amortization activity there?","Matthew J. Audette","I definitely can't speculate on what they think, but I think improving our credit quality is one of the key things that we need to do to be comfortable even asking for a dividend. So I think that focusing on non-amortizing to amortizing or not making any principal payments to having to make them is certainly something that we focus on. But I think I'd just go back to there are a lot of things that we need to do to get to a position to ask for a dividend, improving our credit quality is one of them, cost reduction is another, deleveraging is another. So I just think there's a lot of things to do and we'll eventually see what their reaction is.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ed Ditmire from Macquarie.","Edward Ditmire - Macquarie Research","I've got a question on the core brokerage business. You guys have talked about over the last couple of years becoming a better place for people to do their retirement savings and their long-term investing versus just trading stocks. And I wondered if you might have any detail about how that affects things like, obviously, the average account size, but also how much people trade per year? It's pretty obvious that the online brokers that are the best at serving the longest term investing in this space have the lowest trades per account. And so, I know that there was less trading in 2012 than the year before across all manner of categories and whatnot, but I do worry that, over time, that there's some secular pressures pushing the trading turnover down, such as people just generally owning less stocks and more ETFs and having more of a focus on their long-term. I wanted to hear what you guys thought about that.","Matthew J. Audette","So well, specific to trading, I think the one thing that we've seen for quite some time now is the growth in options, right? So people are not necessarily as much in equities, but they're in options. 24% of our trades this quarter were options, which is up significantly over the past couple of years. On the retirement investing side, I think it's definitely a different business model, it's not a model where they trade as much, they're in assets and the business model, the economics of that, are different. We've been -- we're very clear that it's a long-term strategy, you have to move things meaningfully for it to have a P&L effect. Like you would see in bringing in a lot of trading customers. So it's just a totally different business model. But we think it's one that's important for our customer base. So just as a simple example, the managed products that we launched a couple of years ago, we've gone from [indiscernible] to $1.3 billion. So incredible growth there, but we need and want to grow it much larger than that. So it's things like that we need to focus on and from an economics perspective, you'll see it over time.","Edward Ditmire - Macquarie Research","Just a follow-up. Are you saying that increased options usage will offset the trend towards more investor behavior, lowering the trades per account?","Matthew J. Audette","So my comment on options is more responding to your comment on people are trading in equities less, not going back and forth between retirement, investing and trading. It's just more that the customers that do trade are starting to trade more in options as opposed to equities.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Bedell with ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. Just going back to the deleveraging. Just to make sure I sort of have this math right, I guess. If we're at around $42 billion in earning assets now and you're going to delever another $3 billion from where you were in 4Q, that would get you down to about $39 billion. And then with the mortgage runoff, you're down to around $37 billion. If we assume -- if we're excluding the factor of net new assets from customers and excluding the factor of either net buyers, so securities, should we continue your balance sheet at around $37 billion or so size coming into 2014, is that -- do I have that math about right?","Matthew J. Audette","Almost, except for the loan paydowns. So the strategy to delever the balance sheet is solely liability-focused. So the deleveraging we do there is going to drive the balance sheet size. Loan paydowns, everything else being equal, would just be reinvested in securities. So it's really the liabilities that will drive the balance sheet.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So more like a $39 billion then, based on that math?","Matthew J. Audette","Right.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just on the expense run rate. Do I have it right, in terms of being -- trying to be at around $265 million by, say, the fourth quarter of this year?","Matthew J. Audette","Correct. On a run rate basis, so just keep in mind, seasonality can impact individual quarters, but on a run rate perspective, that's a good way to think about it, yes.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then a question for Paul. Just as you studied the online broker, online brokerage industry, I guess, so far, are there any broad thoughts about untapped areas of opportunity for E*TRADE, such as businesses that they're not in, in any major way?","Paul Thomas Idzik","This is Day 3, I've been working for Matt pretty much, but I think if you want to know my thoughts on that, my submission to the Nobel Prize Committee for Economics will be coming out in a week or 2 on that topic.","Operator","Mr. Audette, I'll be turning the call back to you, sir. You may continue with your presentation or closing remarks.","Matthew J. Audette","All right, thanks, everybody. We appreciate the time. We look forward to talking to you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call.

Please note that E*TRADE Financial disclaims any duty to update any forward-looking statements made in the presentation.","During this call, E*TRADE Financial may also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures in talking about its performance. The company provides these measures due to its belief that they provide important information about its operating results. These measures will be reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures either during the course of this call or in the company's press release, which can be found on its website at investor.etrade.com.

Following management's comments, the call will be opened up for questions. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve Freiberg. Steve, the floor is yours.","Steven J. Freiberg","Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining today's call. The second quarter was another significant step forward for E*TRADE as we grew our 4 franchise in the face of macroeconomic challenges at a market-wide lull in retail investor engagement. We continue to derisk the company, submitted our strategic and capital plan to our regulators and completed our offer to purchase auction rate securities.","We reported earnings per share of $0.14 on revenue of $452 million, inclusive of a few unique items, which Matt will cover in more detail. On the brokerage front, starts were down 6% versus the year-ago quarter, reflective of a generally weak retail trading environment. That aside, we generated healthy growth in net new accounts and assets, comprising the key long-term growth drivers for the franchise. Net new brokerage accounts of 46,000 brings the total for the first half of the year to 92,000 accounts, nearly equaling the 99,000 that we brought in during the entirety of 2011, and well above the 54,000 in 2010. Similarly, the $2.2 billion in net new brokerage assets brings the year-to-date total to $6.2 billion and places us on track to exceed our full-year levels of $9.7 billion in 2011 and $8.1 billion in 2010. Additionally, customer margin receivables ended the period at $5.8 billion, a 4-year high and reflective of increases in both the number of accounts using margin and balances per account during the quarter.","We were also proud to post another quarterly franchise record for brokerage account attrition of 8.4% annualized during the second quarter. This represents an improvement of more than 200 basis points from a year ago and is a testament to our focus on an extraordinary customer experience.","Turning to credit. Our legacy loan portfolio ended the quarter at $11.8 billion, down 5% sequentially and 64% from its peak. Our overall delinquencies were down 11% during the quarter while special mention delinquencies were down 7%. Both are at their lowest levels in approximately 5 years. We are proud of our progress on the continued derisking of the company as we closely manage the runoff of this portfolio.","As for our customer offering, we made enhancements to our E*TRADE pro- platform and simplified the overall user experience on the customer website. We added new tools, including a trading ladder and strategy screeners, giving customers even more realtime market depth and information, including realtime quotes for all E*TRADE 360 users. We opened 2 new branches during the quarter, one in Cupertino, California and one in New York City, bringing our branch total to 30. Over half of our 270 financial consultants reside within our branches providing an important point of contact for our customers, particularly as we expand our activities in the retirement and long-term investing segments. With $33 billion in retirement assets across nearly 800,000 accounts, we have a meaningful base from which to grow. Additionally, we ended the quarter with just under $1 billion in managed assets, over half of which are retirement assets. We're encouraged by our progress and are focused on continuing to build out our brand as a trusted destination for rollover accounts and other retirement services by providing solutions, advice and guidance and client education. Educated investors are typically more engaged customers, so we remain committed to our education efforts across a broad spectrum of categories with over 300,000 interactions during the quarter comprising seminars, webinars and videos, both live and on-demand. We believe that a clear indication of the increasing sophistication of our customers is the steady increase of options as a percentage of DARTs.","Options were 24% of trades this quarter, up from 20% a year ago and 16% 2 years ago. We also continue to experience steady growth in our mobile application usage. During the quarter, 6.6% of our DARTs were executed through E*TRADE mobile, up from 4% a year ago. More than half of these trades are through our iPhone application.","We are executing well in our Corporate Services group and as we exit the quarter, we have a healthy pipeline of prospects. This remains an important strategic channel for new brokerage assets and accounts. The relentless pursuit to provide cutting-edge products and technology and a superior customer experience will continue to drive our core brokerage business strategy, priorities and execution.","I'll now hand the call over to Matt to walk you through the financial results, after which I will follow up with additional comments and then we'll take your questions.","Matthew J. Audette","Thank you, Steve. For the second quarter, we reported net income of $40 million or $0.14 per share. I'll cover this in more detail later but I wanted to highlight upfront that our results included a benefit of approximately $0.04 from a few unique items and other expense and taxes.","Our second quarter net revenues were $452 million, down from $489 million in the first quarter and $518 million in the second quarter of 2011. Revenues included net interest income of $279 million, a sequential decline of $6 million driven by a 5 basis point decline in net interest spread, which was 244 basis points for the quarter. Given the margin growth we observed this quarter, we estimate our spread for the full year of 2012 will average slightly above 240 basis points.","Commissions, fees and service charges, principal transactions and other revenue in the second quarter were $154 million, down 11% from the first quarter and down 12% from the same quarter of 2011. Average commission per trade was $10.68, down from $11.04 last quarter as a result of lower activity from stock plan accounts. Year-over-year average commission per trade was down from $11.14 on less favorable product and customer mix.","Revenue this quarter also included $19 million of net gains in loans and insecurities inclusive of a $5 million impairment.","Total operating expenses declined sequentially by $25 million, reflective of a seasonal decline in advertising and compensation, as well as $3 million related to legal settlements and reserves and a $10 million benefit related to our offer to purchase auction rate securities. As a reminder, we established a $55 million reserve in the third quarter of 2011 related to settlements and our offer to purchase eligible auction rate securities from customers.","In the fourth quarter of 2011, we refined our estimates and reduced this reserve down to $48 million. During the current quarter, we completed this program having purchased in approximately $145 million from eligible holders. The total losses we realized on liquidating those positions was approximately $10 million less than our reserves for this program. With the completion of the offer to purchase, we do not believe we have any remaining material exposure related to auction rate securities.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 35%, which included a benefit of $6.7 million primarily related to state tax credits generated from software development. Without these credits, our effective tax rate this quarter would've been approximately 45%, which is consistent with our expectations for the tax rate going forward. DARTs for the second quarter were 139,000, a 12% decrease from last quarter and down 6% from a year ago. I would note that July-to-date DARTs are tracking down 1% from June.","Net new brokerage accounts were 46,000 in the second quarter, flat with the prior quarter and up from 25,000 in the second quarter of 2011. Net new brokerage assets totaled $2.2 billion during the quarter, representing 5% annualized growth. This was down from $4 billion last quarter but up from $1.5 billion in the second quarter of 2011. We ended the quarter with $29.2 billion in brokerage-related cash, a decrease of $1.8 billion during the quarter, as customers were net buyers of $3.9 billion of securities.","Margin receivables ended the quarter at $5.8 billion, up 9% for the  prior period with average balances of $5.6 billion, up 14% sequentially. Our legacy loan portfolio ended the quarter at $11.8 billion, a contraction of $624 million during the quarter and is now just 36% of its size at the peak. The average age of the loan within this well-seasoned portfolio is now approaching 6.5 years. We expect loan runoff will continue at a pace of approximately $600 million per quarter for the remainder of this year.","Total net charge-offs in the quarter were $121 million, down from $316 million the prior quarter. As a reminder, approximately half of the charge-offs in the first quarter related to our review of modification policies and procedures. If we exclude these charge-offs and look at Q1 on a more normalized basis, charge-offs declined by greater than 20% this quarter. Delinquency performance across the portfolio trended positively as the 30-to-89-day delinquent category improved 7% sequentially and 24% from a year ago. Total at-risk delinquencies are the 30- to 179-day delinquent category, improved by 6% in the period and 28% from a year ago.","Provision for the quarter of $67 million was down from $72 million in the prior quarter. I will also highlight that the provision for 1-4 family loans was relatively minor this quarter at just 250,000. This was driven by 2 factors. First, there are less newly delinquent loans. And second, we received $11 million in settlements from third-party mortgage originators, bringing our life-to-date total of putbacks and settlements to $370 million. We do not expect material feature benefit from settlements of this type as the majority are behind us.","The total allowance for loan losses for the quarter declined by $53 million to end the period at $526 million. We modified $125 million of loans during the quarter, which was down from previous quarters. We expect TDR volumes will continue to decline, partly due to the elimination of certain Home Equity modification programs, but also reflective of fewer loans to modify as the population of newly delinquent loans continues to shrink.","With regards to the performance of our existing modifications, the average regional delinquency rates 12 months after modification has improved slightly for 1-4 family loans to 25% and remain stable for home equity loans at 42%.","With respect to initial loan resets, we do not expect this to be a material driver of credit costs this year. During the second quarter, approximately $440 million of 1-4 family mortgages reset for the first time, bringing the year-to-date total of $920 million, with another $60 million in the second half of this year. Of all 1-4 family loans that were reset this year, approximately $27 million are expected to experience a payment increase of 10% or more.","On our home equity lines of credits, which represents 78% of the Home Equity portfolio, we have approximately $290 million of balances that are already amortizing, with an additional $50 million expected to begin amortizing in the remainder of the year. The vast majority of Home Equity lines do not begin to amortize until 2015 or beyond. With the limited data of a relatively small sample of amortizing loans, it is hard to call it a trend but generally the performance of these loans is consistent with the performance of loans that are not yet amortizing. As of the end of the second quarter, 4% of amortizing home-equity loans are 30- to 179-days delinquent, compared with 3.5% for home equity loans that are not yet amortizing.","Last quarter, we highlighted new supervisory guidance around the treatment of interest for performing junior liens behind nonperforming firsts. At the time of last quarter's call, we estimated the effective population of loans to be something less than 10% of our performing seconds liens. Having completed our analysis in the second quarter, the affected population is far less than our initial estimate, totaling approximately 4%, or $180 million, of performing second lanes. During the quarter, we placed these loans on nonaccrual status, reducing interest income by approximately $1.7 million, which was applied as a reduction to the loan balances. This exercise did not impact our reserves for loan losses as we already contemplate these factors on our loss modeling.","Turning to our financial position. Corporate cash ended the quarter at $437 million, representing over 2.5 years of debt service coverage. The decline of $47 million, related primarily to $82 million of interest payments, partially offset by other reimbursements and allocations from subsidiaries. As a reminder, our parent has approximately $400 million in deferred tax assets, which is a source of corporate cash in future periods.","On capital, we grew ratios at both the bank and parent during the quarter across all measures. This was a combination of capital generation along with a reduction in balance sheet assets driven by the decline in brokerage customer cash during the quarter. To highlight a nuance between the parent and bank ratios, parent capital calculation use average assets while the bank calculations are end of period. As such, this quarter's more pronounced improvement in the bank's ratios was indicative of a decrease in asset late in the quarter, which should benefit average assets at the parent in Q3.","Turning now to potential changes in capital requirements. Near quarter end, the Fed published a notice of proposed rule-making, or NPR for comment, regarding the implementation of Basel III capital calculations. We are still working through the details but I would like to highlight a few points we believe are relevant to E*TRADE. First, the Fed is seeking comment and an alternative method to include in Tier 1 capital the unrealized gains and losses related to government agencies' securities. If implemented, this would remove a substantial source of downside volatility from our ratios in future periods should rates eventually rise. Second, clarity was provided on proposed risk weightings, which we estimate could actually lead to an improvement to our ratios under the calculations laid out in the NPR. For the mortgage portfolio, which is currently risk-weighted between 50% and 100%, to average about 80%, we estimate risk weightings could increase to approximately 120%. Offsetting this is a likely reduction in the risk weighting of customer margin loans, which are currently risk-weighted at 100%. We estimate there could be a substantial reduction to as low as 0% for overcollateralized margin loans, which would more than offset the capital impact from the residential mortgage portfolio.","For our parents Tier 1 common ratio, which remains the central focus of the new guidelines, we estimate that our ratio of 10.2% under current Basel guidelines would improve by approximately 70 basis points should all elements of the NPR be implemented. I would just caution that we're not certain that will be the case and that some or all of the proposals are subject to change before implementation, which is not proposed to occur until 2015. Under these new guidelines, as well as current ones, Tier 1 leverage remains our constraining ratio. And as I discussed last quarter, we are working to address this ratio by reducing the overall size of the balance sheet.","The balance sheet declined by $2 billion during the quarter mostly as a result of a decline in brokerage customer cash due to customer purchase activity. While we don't have anything specific to announce today, we are working on several strategies to reduce the size of the balance sheets and we hope to have some specifics for you by next quarter. To highlight the liabilities we would target reducing in order of preference, first is wholesale funding, as it is expensive and not core to our strategy. However, because the costs associated with exiting these obligations have likely proved to be more punitive to capital than beneficial, we do not view this as a viable near-term option.","Second is banking deposits, specifically our complete savings account. We recently reduced the rate paid on this account to 5 basis points and the balances declined by nearly $500 million during the quarter. These deposits are also not core to our strategy and we are reviewing other options beyond just adjusting the rate. It is also important to note that a portion of these deposits are tied to valuable brokerage customers, so we would be mindful in targeting these deposits.","The third category is sweep deposits for our 4 brokerage customer cash. While moving sweep off balance sheet could be the easiest option to implement, it is also the option we would need to structure with maximum flexibility to recapture balances on our balance sheet and in a manner which would be seamless to customers.","On the regulatory front, we submitted our long-term capital plan to both the Fed and the OCC at the end of June. The plan we submitted forecasts our business and outlines capital distribution in currents and adverse operating conditions over the next 5 years, applying internally developed stress tests similar in nature to the recent CCAR test. The extensive work that went into creating this plan facilitated a valuable assessment of all elements of our strategy and facets of our business to ensure that we are focused appropriately in consideration of the operating environment, optimal capital generation and risk profile. While the plan was quite detailed and extensive, the core principles that will be our primary strategic guide in the near-term can be summed up simply as follows:","First, continue our focus on our core retail brokerage business, which is the heart of this company. Second, develop cost reduction targets and an enhanced focus on efficiencies. Third, strengthen our risk profile by reducing credit costs and the size of the balance sheet. And fourth, focus on enhancing our credit and risk management functions to ensure they meet the standards for the current regulatory environment.","Given this revision in our focus, we have realigned the bank organization to have an exclusive focus on derisking, deleveraging and bolstering our enterprise risk management functions. Accordingly, we have ceased any plans to offer new banking products to customers, including mortgages. With this organizational realignment, Steve has taken on the additional title of Bank President, while select responsibilities have been distributed among other members of the senior management team.","In closing, and to emphasize our top priority from a financial and franchise standpoint, we recognize that freeing up bank capital and reducing the cost of our corporate debt is one of the most accretive things we can accomplish in the near term. Therefore, improving our risk profile, capital position and regulatory relationships are the primary objectives behind all initiatives going forward.","With that, I will turn the call back to Steve for closing remarks.","Steven J. Freiberg","Thank you, Matt. In summary, although it's a challenging environment, we have continued to execute well and have grown our core business, strengthened our financial position and improved our risk profile. I am proud of our employees at what we have accomplished so far.","Our accountant asset growth, coupled with high levels of customer satisfaction and improved retention are a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team. While we generated capital, effectively boosting or bolstering key ratios in the period, we look to continually improve these measures. And finally, we have made significant and continuous progress in reducing our legacy credit exposure.","As we have discussed, the current environment presents many challenges although as a management team, it's incumbent upon us to focus on what we can directly control. As Matt mentioned, we are in the process of developing cost reduction targets with an enhanced focus on efficiencies. We are specifically targeting areas that are not core to our brokerage franchise or have a low potential return in the current environment. Therefore, we plan to reduce at least $40 million from our expense base. This includes targeting a reduction in costs of at least $50 million, offset by a $10 million investment as we build out our enterprise risk management function and fully address the heightened regulatory environment. We expect to have the cost reductions fully implemented by the end of 2013, although we're aiming to complete the majority of the reductions within the next 12 months. Throughout the remainder of this year, we will continue to focus on the initiatives that we began in the first half, including continued growth in our core brokerage franchise, deleveraging, derisking, expense reduction and dialogue with our regulators related to our strategic and capital plan.","With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Chris Allen from Evercore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I guess if you just touch on the spread outlook to start. 240 basis bps over the course of the remainder of the -- 240 for the full year. Does that account for margin balances remaining where they are right now?","Matthew J. Audette","Chris, it's Matt. It does. If you go back to the last quarter, our estimate for the year was around 240. And in my prepared remarks said I -- we estimate slightly above 240 and the increase in margin we saw in the quarter was one of the primary reasons for that. So if you have your own assumption of margins are going to increase dramatically, it would definitely improve our spread and the opposite would be true as well. If that goes down, it would certainly decrease spread.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just on the cost reduction efforts. I mean, can you give us any examples of the specific areas you will be looking to target?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure, Chris, at a high-level, everything. So there's no one big area that we would target other than having the philosophy of being more efficient. And then in everything we do getting an extreme focus on prioritization and making sure that everything that we do are the most important things we needed to do and things that are lower in the priority list, we would stop doing. So it's each and every area of the company that needs to get more efficient and more focused and that's -- so the costs will really come from everywhere.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just talk a little bit again about the arm repricing on the 1-4 family. How much is left to reprice over the next 1 to 2 years?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure. So on the 1-4 family portfolio, it's about $6 billion, about $5 billion of that overall adjusts. So far, about half of it has already adjust and the other half really isn't going to adjust in a meaningful way until 2015 and '16. So it's well off into the future.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, got it. Okay. And then on the margin loan balances, I know they're up at quarter end. Is it your view that you have given the slowdown in retail trading we're seeing in the summer...","Steven J. Freiberg","Could you complete that, Brian? Operator?","Operator","Sorry, it looks like his line got disconnected [Operator Instructions].","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just on margin loans, just trying to get a sense of the direction obviously, good performance in the second quarter and into quarter end and just trying to get a sense of how you're seeing that play out over the summer, where do you see that pull forward?","Steven J. Freiberg","Yes. Brian, let me just give you some perspective. It's hard to be prospective on it, so maybe perspective is better. If you look at the first 6 months of the year, where we ended 2011 into the end of the second quarter, the expansion in margin balances was actually quite impressive, at approximately $1 billion from the $4.8 billion to $5.8 billion. The amount of net buying in the second quarter, even though the DART activity was somewhat depressed relative to a more normalized set of trends for industry-wide, the net buying was quite extensive by our customers, I think, approximately $3.9 billion of net buying. And so within that context, clearly, our customers have made more of a bullish view and have used leverage within that frame. What I can tell you is that we haven't really seen any change in the early going in the new quarter but it's very hard to predict out over the horizon so hopefully that puts the context to it. So this has not been a one-quarter phenomenon. We've seen the expansion over the first half of the year. We seen substantial net buying by our customers and it's hard to predict whether or not that trend will continue. But as Matt made the point, it's a trend that we like.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess the question is on the provisioning, Matt. I didn't quite get what you said about the 1 to 4 being sold to 250,000 but -- and also adding on to that question, the Home Equity provision seems like it's going up and down. I'm just trying to see what's the sort of the run rate or normalized -- should it, rates should have been for the quarter or so amount?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure, Rich. So on the 1-4, a couple of things there. I was just trying to highlight why the provision was still low at 250,000 for the quarter. The primary item was we had some settlements with third parties during the quarter, so putbacks, which happen all the time in every quarter. This quarter, it just happened to be primarily focused on the 1-4 family books. So if you kind of look back to last quarter, when it was around at $16 million, that's one of the big reasons it was lower this quarter. From a more normalized perspective, I think that the comments and our thoughts on provision are really the same that they've been in the past -- for quite some time now, which is over the long-term, we expect it to decline. But in any given quarter, you can definitely see some volatility. And then when you look at it by products, so by 1-4 family and by Home Equity and by consumer, that volatility can be even higher. So it's going to be choppy but we think the long-term trend will -- down will continue.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, okay. And then I guess, Steve, I know you did put a lot of time and effort and thought into the capital plan. And I know it's a very recently submitted at quarter end, but any feedback or any discussion with the regulators? And how is that affecting your planning when the Springing Lien Notes come due in December or can be called in September?","Steven J. Freiberg","Yes, very much the relevant question. Given both the OCC and the Fed really have possession of both the strategic and capital plans for a matter of weeks. We really had no tangible, I would say, conversations at this point, as they're digesting what we provided them. And we would expect over the coming, probably over the coming weeks and months, really on their schedule, to get good feedback on how they feel about our views. On the plan I submitted, it was, to Matt's point, a fairly comprehensive document, basically well in excess of 100 pages. We think it was, in our view, it made the relevant points from their level of interest but we're just not able at this point because we haven't had feedback to get into any detailed discussion.","Matthew J. Audette","Yes, and then, Rich, this is Matt. Just specific to the Springing Lien Notes. I think our thoughts there are similar to they've been for the past quarters, which is where -- if you look at where our existing notes trade today and you assume that's where we could issue new debt, the economics of refinancing would be incredibly positive but our gating factor remains the loss that would come along with our refinance, which if you just assume we called them at the first call date, which is at the year, the call premium would be something a little bit north of $100 million, or around $115 million. And then the discount on the existing debt's $150 million. So you got to put that together and even though the economics would be great, you'd have a P&L loss in the $260 million range, which would reduce our leverage ratio at the parent by about 60 basis points. So that's -- the gating factor for us is going to be really to get that ratio up to a point where we're comfortable with that after the refinance at a level where we're comfortable and the regulators are comfortable. So it makes the reduction of the balance sheet size incredibly important from my perspective.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A question for you on your net interest spread and I guess looking forward. Matt, are you at a point where you can kind of assess how the tenure has moved and interest rates have moved recently and the long-term impact of that on your net interest spread?","Matthew J. Audette","Well, long-term, so as far as next year I think if sitting in the environment we're in today, so being slightly above 240 for 2012, I think absent anything else, we'd probably drop another 10 basis points next year, but really no commentary beyond that, Patrick.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Well, that's helpful. And then I guess with my follow-up. There's obviously a lot of volatility in your commission for trade and you talked a little bit about it bouncing around. Kind of interesting there, you talked about how a derivatives are a larger percent to your trading volume. Now should we not be expecting to see some benefit of that derivative trading volume in your revenue per trade?","Steven J. Freiberg","When you look at the sort of the variance on the commissions in any particular given quarter, a number of factors, that's clearly one factor that tends to play to the positive, but if you look on a sequential basis, a more significant factor from quarter 1 to quarter 2 was a reduction in the number of Corporate Services group trades, which clearly come in at a substantially higher level of commissions. And it tends to be aseasonal as well as dependent upon the conditions of the market in any given period. And if we look on a year-on-year basis, what's interesting is, as we made the point, options and derivative trades are a higher percentage today than they were a year ago. But that said, because of the lull in, I would say, the broad-based retail trader, so even the trades coming in are stratified now more heavily towards the active trader, which tends to basically trade at a lower level of commission than the broad middle. It is essentially the composition of all those elements to get to the aggregation of what you see. So we see essentially on 7 or 8 different variables the ins and the outs. But when you take them in the aggregate, the particular quarter that you're seeing today has a heavy bias on the drop in Corporate Services group trades and they tend to be volatile and seasonal. But more importantly, as the broad middle has more or less retrenched at a higher rate then I would say the active trader, it's the level of commissions or the rate of commission that each of those pay.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Your goal of alleviating leverage appears to be focused on shrinking the balance sheet. I guess given parts of the balance sheet growth are core to the retail brokerage franchise, are you ruling out, in a raising common or preferred to maybe alleviate that leverage faster, pay down that expense of debt, perhaps optimize the capital structure a bit faster?","Matthew J. Audette","Howard, it's Matt. So I would say we don't rule out anything. I think the -- any option that would improve our capital ratio that made sense for shareholders is something that we would look at. I think if you can tell by the area of our focus in over the past few quarters, in particular, and in our prepared remarks this quarter, that the avenue we think makes the most sense is through a reduction of the balance sheet size. So that's really where we're focused, but I think we would always consider anything that made sense for shareholders.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then just my follow-up, sorry if I missed this in your prepared remarks, but is it still your view that provisioning expense will continue to trend lower from this quarter over the balance of this year?","Matthew J. Audette","So I didn't get that precise, Howard. I think that we certainly think the longer-term trend of going down will continue and there could be volatility in any given quarter. I mean, there could be volatility the next quarter compared to this quarter. So it's more of a longer-term comment than a precise comment to the next few quarters.","Steven J. Freiberg","But, Howard, broadly speaking, the primary driver will be the level of delinquencies. And if delinquencies have continued to basically move down, that should give you a good level of, I guess, inside as well as confidence in the direction but Matt's, I think, Matt's comments are important that on any particular quarter could have some volatility. But broadly speaking, as long as we can sustain a trend where the portfolio is dropping in size and the level of delinquency is dropping as well, that should be a good arbiter of what's to come.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And certainly, we've been seeing those trends over the past couple of quarters and years. I guess, just final one looking forward out on that. I was just hoping, Matt, can you just speak about some of the historical performance that you've seen on the loans that have reset?","Matthew J. Audette","On the 1-4 family books, so we -- we really don't have any specific date on that. I did give some commentary in the prepared remarks on the home equity size where they've gone from non-amortizing to amortizing. And the data there, it's really early days, and we haven't really seen any difference in performance there.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Keith Murray with Nomura.","Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","On the pace of the decline in the servicing costs and clearing, it was down a little bit in the quarter. How should we think about the decline going forward? Should it sort of go down somewhat percentage-wise on par with the loan decline?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure. So if you break down the 2 parts on the clearing side of clearing and servicing is really going to move in line with trading activity. In the servicing side, in general, I think it will, yes, it will move down in line with the portfolio. The one caveat I'd have to that is keep in mind it can be a little bit lumpy and that the costs associated with default servicing and REO expenses and things like that can -- don't necessarily move in line with the  size of the portfolio. But definitely over the long-term, that's the case.","Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then back to the focus on capital. So thinking about the Tier 1 leverage ratio, do you guys have a target in mind? It's 5 to 7 now, do you think something in the mid-6 range is where you'd like to get to?","Matthew J. Audette","So for leverage ratio, in general, we want to get to a place where our regulators are comfortable with our capital ratios and we're at a point where we can efficiently distribute capital between the bank and the parent. So as you can imagine, we certainly put forth in our capital strategic plan what we thought those ratios should be. But really, the ultimate answer is we;ve got to get to a place where we're comfortable and our regulators are comfortable. So it's going to be something that evolves over time as opposed to something that we have today.","Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And then one final one, as I think about the Springing Lien Notes and the capital plan that you guys gave to the OCC and the Fed, is a partial refi or a partial retirement of the 12.5% notes included in that, or is that a thought that you guys might have?","Matthew J. Audette","So separate from the plan, I think it's absolutely a thought we would have. So we -- you could refinance the entire amount. You could certainly refinance the part. I think the most, given the economics of refinancing, any of it are so incredibly compelling. Our objective would be to get to a place where our balance sheet's small enough that we could refinance the whole thing. But certainly a partial refinance is a possibility.","Operator","And your next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I had another follow-on to the Springing Liens, so there could be one more I guess.  But do you have a view of how low, I guess, the regulators can allow you to go on a Tier 1 leverage given the fact that it is an immediate hit to capital, but it's really easy to see how economics will be very accretive. Basically the first quarter, you refinance that so -- and then I guess from there, there's other mitigating things you could do. So can you help us understand maybe a little bit more on the minimal level of Tier 1 leverage than I guess is still possible for you to be at in order to get this done?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure. So it's going to be very similar to our thoughts on having target leverage ratios overall. The most important thing is that we get to a place where our regulators are going to be comfortable with the ratios, in particular to our refinance here, will they be comfortable with a ratio subsequent or after that refinance? So it's something that hopefully we'll have some dialogue on and we'll get to that place. I can tell you personally, I wouldn't want to end, have a consolidated leverage ratio drop below 5.5% after a refinance, but that's just me and my feel.","Steven J. Freiberg","But -- and let me just add, clearly, our preference is to refinance this debt, and there's no equivocation on that point. I think Matt's point is that we need to have a level of comfort and are regulators need to have at least a level of comfort on the safety and the soundness of the institution. I can tell you a lot and clearly, the regulatory community, particularly at the parent, understands the economic value and merits of this transaction, and we just have to balance off all the elements. There's nothing that is unattainable here. But we haven't got to a definitive stage as of yet. And if you put it into full perspective, we ended the quarter as, I think, either you or Keith have made the point, at approximately a 5.7% leverage ratio at the parent. Clearly, that was based, that parent on the -- on basically on the averages, not the ending. You can call it maybe probably closer to 5.9% if you're using guide you to ending, but we still have to build a bit. But that said, the 5.5%, which is sort of a one-man's view, which I think is sort of a rational view, but the other side is the cost, if we took it all down at one particular point when they're callable, could cost us as much as,  say, a 60 basis points on our leverage ratio. So we have to find the right level of balance working with our regulators, but the economics of the transaction are very compelling. The desire is there. We just -- we will find or need to find the balance.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. The other thing I wanted to dig into a little bit more just looking at different rates on the balance sheet, if I look at the health and maturity securities, you guys are still earning closer to 3% yields on that. Matt, can you give us a little more granularity on the duration of that book? What kind of reinvestment yields you guys are seeing because it feels like things that are, I guess, somewhat of comfort if you will get the agency paper, 2-to-3-year duration, that's now yielding sub-2%. So I guess if we roll that forward, how should we think about the repricing risk on the securities books? I guess, how the maturities are always available for sale.","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. So I think the broad way to think about it is from an interest rate risk perspective, we're always managing to an overall balance sheet position. The buying and selling of securities is really the final thing that we do to get to an interest rate position that we're comparable with based on deposits that come in or pull out that quarter, the loan paydowns that happens. So looking at an individual line item always gets -- it's a little bit skewed because it's reflective of the purchases of the sales that we had to make to get to that overall interest rate risk position. So it's really from a management perspective, it's not something where the duration of a particular line item is something we focus on versus the broader view of the overall balance sheet of running a relatively matched book.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And this is the last one for me, could you guys, well, share a little bit more your comments around some of the deposit strategies you mentioned with potentially trying to reduce the size of the balance sheet. I don't know, anything around the size of how much you could potentially move or how the economics of that would work out for you.","Matthew J. Audette","Sure. So I think where the areas that we're targeting, as I covered a little bit earlier, are the wholesale funding, the bank-specific funding and then lastly, the brokerage-related cash or the sweep accounts. So from a sizing perspective, I think kind of back to the overall comments, from a regulatory perspective is the amount we would target is something that helps us get to a place where we're all comfortable with our capital ratios, particularly the leverage ratio. I can tell you my perspective, though, just given the core of the company and the deposits that it produces, I think a reduction of $5 billion to $10  billion from here is a place that I'd be much more comfortable.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joel Jeffrey with KBW.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on Alex's question a little bit. Can you talk about some of maybe the some of the specific strategies you're thinking about in terms of moving the deposits off the balance sheet?","Matthew J. Audette","Absolutely. So on the wholesale side, there's not a lot of strategies other than we can pick around the edges given that the cost of reducing that would be around, overall it would be around $700 million. On the bank side, on the primary item that we've done so far, is we reduced that rate on our complete savings account, which is the primary bank product, down to 5 basis points. We saw outflows of $500 million in the quarter in that. So it's something from a balance sheet perspective, we certainly hope to continue going forward. Well, we can also look at other strategies on that account, right? For accounts that are not closely connected to our valuable brokerage customers. You can look at a sale, so that's another thing we would look at. On the brokerage side, or the sweep side, that's the type of product where from an operational perspective, we even have some of those deposits off balance sheet today, where the customer relationship is with us but the funds are off-balance sheet. And so specific to that fund, that's what we would look to do. We would look to really set up sweep arrangements, where the sweep goes to a third-party bank as opposed to our bank. So those are probably the most notable things that we're working on.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just lastly, can you give a sense for how DARTs are tracking in July?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure, down 1% from June.","Operator","And your next question comes from Michael Carrier with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question, you guys pointed out the $0.01, the legal benefit in the release. But, Matt, I think you mentioned like $0.04. I just wanted to make sure the other $0.03, is it just the tax rate or are you including that, the provision, I don't know if you want to call it an adjustment, but the provision benefit?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure. So it's really just the tax and the operating expenses. I think when you add them together, it comes up to something like $0.0351 or something, very close to a round up to $0.04. And so it's really just those 2 items, the tax and the other expense.","David J. Chiaverini - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, got it. And then just on the expenses, when you're talking about that net number of $40 million, are you looking at like this quarter's run rate or like what run rate should we be taking because advertising in certain quarters are going to be higher or lower?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure. So we think from a -- when you take seasonality out, and a good run-rate quarterly expense for us is around $290 million, so once the costs are fully implemented, I would view our run rate at that point would be $280 million.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then last one, just on the NIM, got the near-term outlook. Just given the current rate environment, the balance sheet, the runoff and the reduction in any reinvestment, just any outlook for 2013?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure. I mean, in this environment, everything else being equal, I think around a 10 basis point reduction in 2013 is kind of how we think about it. The one thing I would keep in mind from a -- just from a pure spread metric perspective, the more successful we are in deleveraging, the smaller the balance sheet's going to be and the higher the spread would likely be, even though the overall balance sheet would be smaller, so it would produce less net interest income. But just keep in mind there could be some volatility there on that particular metric with the deleveraging.","Operator","Your next question comes from the Faye Elliott with BGB Securities.","Faye Elliott-Gurney - BGB Securities, Inc., Research Division","Have you outlined the amortization schedule of the HELOC, not when they start amortizing but what percent of them would have full principal repayment do?","Matthew J. Audette","So I'm not sure I follow, Faye. So meaning like a maturity once -- is that what you're looking for?","Faye Elliott-Gurney - BGB Securities, Inc., Research Division","Right. But once they start amortizing. And I know you've given that schedule out. What is the time to maturity after that or the average time to maturity? And, really, what I'm interested in is, if you have any bullets on there and if you do, what percent?","Matthew J. Audette","So the -- so your typical Home Equity is going to have a 7-to-10-year drop period that's going to amortize for 15 years after that roughly. But I think the most compelling thing, the most relevant thing we view is that data that we put out, which is how many of the loans have begun to amortize or not, because that's really going to be the credit event. And the key for us is very few of those have begun to amortize, and if we don't get to a point where a meaningful number of those are amortizing until 2015 and beyond, so it's something well off into the future.","Faye Elliott-Gurney - BGB Securities, Inc., Research Division","So all of yours are typical then?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes, I'm speaking to -- our portfolio is typical from an amortization perspective.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Fischer with CLSA.","Matthew Fischer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Regarding back to the cost reductions. The -- you mentioned that it's coming out of every area and you're going to go through that, but what percent are we talking about in terms of people taking out headcount? And then also, how does this impact the expansion of branch network? Are you still going to do that?","Matthew J. Audette","So from a branch network, I think, as Steve covered, we opened 2 new branches. We're up to 30. We don't have really any commentary or plans for a big expansion beyond that, but we would stop or start. With respect to where the costs would come from, I -- probably the only -- the best color, the additional color I can provide you is from looking at a line item perspective, things like FDIC insurance, depreciation and amortization, amortization of other intangibles, those are really things from just a cost reduction strategy perspective you really can't control. So it's more coming out of the other areas. So I don't have a focus on anything beyond that other than it's going to -- all those other outlined items is where it would come from and from all areas of the company.","Steven J. Freiberg","Let me just add without getting to a level of specificity because we're, again, we're not prepared to have that dialogue today. We have a pretty good plan laid out at, internally, that is actionable. And when we basically have the opportunity to convey that we will, but we're serious about it. We believe we can do it with no harm to our core franchise and remain competitive in the marketplace, continue to basically do what we have been doing, which is derisking the franchise, growing basically the core and hopefully positioning ourselves well as we look forward to a more normalized environment. We just can't predict when.","Matthew Fischer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then back to the investor sentiment. So you've kind of have 2 things going on. You've got margin increasing. Customers are net buyers of securities. Yet, DARTs are down pretty considerably and we're in this weak summer period, so I don't know if maybe mix of securities purchases or how can you -- can you give us an idea of...","Matthew J. Audette","Yes, I think the best at least the way -- I think the best way to express it is similar to the question asked earlier on the reduction in commission rate or the basically commission per trade, that what we really see is that largely, the active traders have remained engaged. And what really have seen is the broad, and I would say the broad middle, has diminished activity. And so the more sophisticated, the more active investors, which tend to basically have more of a bias towards being contrarian and more of a bias towards using leverage remain very active within basically the market. But what you're seeing is the reduction, I think, on industry-wide as well as in E*TRADE, because essentially it's that broad middle has been more reluctant to trade, given the nature of the markets and the environment. Hopefully that gives you some perspective. We see it at a segmented, very detailed level but that is the, I think, the best way to view it and the best lens to view it through. And so when the level of confidence, which is what we were talking about, broadly speaking, consumer confidence, rises, hopefully then retail engagement will broadly will take hold and then what we'll see is an increase in overall trades. We'll see a change in the composition of the commissions and hopefully that will be a good story. But, again, there's been a lot of volatility around that at least for the 2 years or so that I've been here. And we have not seen, I think as an industry, a sustainable trend on that front. Just maybe just also to finish up. The one thing that we will continue to emphasize that we do believe at some point normal will return. We just can't predict one. And what we believe is most important to our franchise is continue to do what we're doing, particularly on the core franchise, which is to grow high-quality accounts; grow the asset base; position ourselves to do more for our customers than just trade; help them basically in their retirement needs, their long-term investing needs, and we'll basically be a much better position firm when normal returns.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Harris.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So on the reduction of the balance sheet here. As far as the potential to move deposits to a third party. The number you're talking about here, the $5 billion to $10 billion, that's a quarter of your, a quarter or so of your deposits and it'd have a pretty big impact on your net interest revenue like you mentioned. Is there some way you guys can get some clarity from the regulators or maybe some guidance from the regulators that says, \"hey, gee, if we do this, will we be able to kind of refinance or retire the Springing Lien Notes?\" Or is there really just no way to do that, you guys just have to kind of go ahead and reduce the balance sheet and then wait and see what the regulators say?","Matthew J. Audette","So there is. I mean, it's one of the purposes of the key tenets of our plan. So we've got -- we submitted a 5-year strategic and capital plan. So it's got our forecast of things that we want to do and think makes sense to do. And I think that's really the form in the item that will help facilitate that dialogue. So I think that's how we'll get to that point.","Steven J. Freiberg","Let me just add just a couple of additional points.  One, when you talk about the actual numbers, Matt's point of $5 billion to $10 billion, first it's aspirational all over an extended period of time. Secondarily, and I think Matt addressed it even in his first point. So for example, and I've said this and Matt has for quite a while, that the overall size of the balance sheet over time will be more reflective of our, basically, of our customers' deposits with us in the current composition of the balance sheet. So for example, there's a significant amount of balances that are on that balance sheet via wholesale funding that today are net drags, meaning they actually are eroding our margins, not improving our margins. And so when we think about this and you think about it broadly, it's not the average assets coming off, it's over time reconstructing the company in a much more compelling way, both in its size and its economics. And in the short-term, we have limited options. And in the longer-term, we have more degrees of freedom, and it's finding that right balance. Hopefully that helps.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, it does. Just one follow-up on that. So can we assume the $5 billion to $10 billion number you're talking about, that was -- that number wasn't just pulled out of thin air, it was done in concert with the discussions with the regulators?","Matthew J. Audette","Well, I'd say it definitely wasn't pulled out of thin air. I think it's where I, from my perspective, where I think the core business of the company and the deposits it produces, I think that's where I'd be much more comfortable, and I'd leave it at that.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. All right, that's fair enough. And along the same lines then, just wondering how you guys think about, I mean, clearly, you're getting great growth as a broker. I was just wondering if that's really the correct strategic course, given you're really trying to reduce or shrink your balance sheet. Just a little bit thoughts about how you managed the growth of the broker versus wanting to shrink the budget will be helpful.","Matthew J. Audette","Sure. So I think from a -- from the growth of the broker, I think, over the long term, it would -- is an incredibly valuable thing to do. I think the thing that we have to manage is growth of the broker with little to no growth of the balance sheet. So I think when you go to the strategies we're pursuing, that third strategy of brokerage cash, can we be in a place where we can grow the franchise but grow it with a cash on\/off balance sheet? I think that's the trick to make that work quite well.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Would the incremental broker account you get without being able to manage the cash -- I'd assume then that that's going to be a much less profitable proposition for you than one if where you can manage the cash? I'm just trying to get a sense of incremental profitability of actually adding an account where you can't -- where you can't manage the client cash.","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. So from an income perspective, I think, generically, having the deposit on your balance sheet produces more income than on someone else, than the fee you get paid for being on somebody else's balance sheet. The key for us though is the return on equity, right. So the balance sheet size and the equity have, we have to be in the right -- in the place where our balance sheet size is the right size for the equity that we have, because if your capital ratios are too low, increasing the size of your balance sheet, that incremental return on equity may not be compelling. So it's really that balance that we need to find that makes the most sense.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Freiberg, I'll turn the call back over to you.","Steven J. Freiberg","Thank you. So let me just say in closing, I'd like to reiterate our commitment to growing our core brokerage franchise and enhancing our competitive position, continue the derisking and the deleveraging of the balance sheet and ensuring full alignment with the expectations of our regulators. And with that, I want to thank you, and say, good evening.","Operator","Thank you again for joining us today. This does conclude today's web conference.

Good evening and thank you for spending some time with us.","We had a productive quarter marked by a number of accomplishments on both the customer facing and financial fronts. We launched one of our most compelling offerings in recent history. We generated healthy levels of capital while marching forward on our capital deployment initiatives. And the investments made to strengthen our platforms and infrastructure again proved their worth as we handled the flurry of Brexit-inspired customer activity without getting on to a sticky wicket.","Meanwhile on an industry level, we deftly managed the challenges of the revenue environment while progressing our work related to the Department of Labor fiduciary standards.","Starting with our results, we reported net income of $133 million or $0.48 per share for the quarter. We again had a sizable benefit to the provision line, led by a solid loan performance and outsized recoveries. These recoveries are a phenomenon which is difficult to predict but can dramatically impact a portfolio as seasoned as ours.","On the customer activity front, metrics remain healthy, largely reflecting seasonality relative to the prior quarter. Trading activity declined throughout the period, but experienced a spike surrounding the courageous UK vote to leave the European Union, when our customers took advantage of the dip in the equity markets to the tune of $1.1 billion in net buying during a single trading day, the highest on record.","The significant attention we placed on strengthening our infrastructure over the past several years enabled our platforms to handle these elevated volumes with room to spare. For the entire quarter, a record 17% of DARTs were executed via mobile platforms. In July to date, DARTs are currently tracking down 1% from June.","Margin balances, which had slowly edged down throughout Q1, ended the second quarter up at $6.8 billion. The majority of the $0.5 billion increase was a Brexit-bolstered spike, so the quarter's average was lower at $6.5 billion. In July to date, balances have tapered to $6.4 billion.","We added 23,000 net new accounts in Q2, down from Q1's solid 45,000 adjusted new accounts and last year's 25,000. Our attrition rate of 8.3% remained encouraging for the quarter. While an increase from a near record adjusted 7.3% in the prior quarter, it decreased from an adjusted 8.7% a year ago. We also attracted $1.6 billion in net new brokerage assets, reflecting our strongest Q2 in several years, but down sequentially on typical tax-related outflows in April.","We made meaningful enhancements to the customer experience this quarter. On the product front, Adaptive Portfolio, our robo-solution, is the most important new product launch in some time. While still very early days from our June launch, we are pleased with adoption thus far, having amassed more than $100 million of assets under management in the program, including legacy managed account balances converted upon launch.","The offering stands out in a few ways. First, it provides our customers the option of combining active and passive management, a new concept for the auto investing space, which has traditionally relied on passive only portfolios. Second, it falls between our pure digital and managed account solutions, delivering a best-in-class digital experience combined with access to financial consultants when customers have questions or want to discuss the portfolio selected by the online tool.","Third, at circa 1%, the low cash allocation means customers' money is being put to work for them through their investments, while keeping just enough cash to rebalance and service the portfolio as necessary.","And last, consistent with our unbiased approach to providing our customers with the solutions right for their own needs, we have no proprietary products within our model portfolios. So the investments available to customers are selected to be the best for each particular portfolio construction and not just the best that happen to carry our name. Importantly, the solution serves longer term retirement investing and savings dollars, so it is an important component of our ongoing efforts to increase share of wallet among our existing customer base.","Additionally, we've found that as customers and prospects are navigating the Adaptive Portfolio experience they are also looking at our other offerings, leading to increased activity and self-directed account openings.","Transitioning over to our corporate services channel, we are in the midst of rolling out a completely redesigned stock plan participant experience. We've long had an edge in this business because of our top rated platform, Equity Edge Online. However, over the past three years, we've been acutely focused on further improving both the B2B and B2C elements of this channel. This rollout presents plan participants with a more streamlined, intuitive and engaging experience.","We always strive to surprise and delight our customers, but when it comes to the stock plan participant, getting the digital experience right is essential. We understand deeply that these participants are not your typical investor, often joining us with financial knowledge less developed than what we find with mainstream E*TRADE customers. Further, stock plan benefits are inherently complicated. So the more we can do to educate and engage these participants, the more they may value this component of their compensation and thus appropriately value their employer for providing it. This is no small responsibility, and one we take extremely seriously.","In terms of industry accolades, we were recognized by Kiplinger's this quarter in their biennial review of online brokers, earning high marks in tools and ease of use as well as first place for mobile, a platform which is increasingly important to our customers and where we frequently stand out from the crowd.","Expenses for the quarter were $295 million, down $17 million from Q1, primarily due to seasonality and advertising, driving our adjusted operating margin, which excludes provision, to 38% from 34%. In the face of a progressively challenging interest rate environment, we remain committed to keeping our expenses appropriately sized and continue to expect a 37% adjusted operating margin for the full year, barring exogenous factors.","On the capital front, we continue to execute on both of our deployment initiatives, putting $151 million to work repurchasing our common stock, ending the quarter nearly two-thirds the way through our $800 million program, and continuing to grow the balance sheet, ending the quarter at $49.2 billion, closely approaching our target of $49.5 billion.","And for what's next, we continue to dedicate a lot of time and energy to this question, considering share repurchase beyond our current program, evaluating growth or enrichment through acquisition and examining balance sheet growth beyond our current target.","Regarding that final point, we've been very clear that in order to justify the compliance cost and achieve appropriate returns on capital, we need some combination of higher interest rates and a more sizeable quantum of deposits to allow us to pounce confidently over the $50 billion threshold. Today with interest rates unlikely to rise in the near term and our current level of available off-balance sheet deposits at about $2 billion, we've planned to asymptotically dance below the NIFTY 50 line as crossing would equate to more of a tiptoe than a pounce.","However, with industry reform making money market fund to suboptimal sweep vehicle for customers, the team is working to convert approximately $4 billion or substantially all of our money market funds into our cash sweep program, thus increasing our potential balance sheet size to above $55 billion.","While there are still boxes to check, we already have regulatory approval and we intend to complete this conversion in September. With that move, we anticipate crossing $50 billion in the first half of next year. Mr. Pizzi will provide an update on the particulars and the costs to conduct the Pizzi pounce.","Moving on to the DOL fiduciary standards, we made significant headway this quarter working through this overreaching rule, which has proved rather Proustian in nature and shrouded with ambiguity. I'm pleased to report that we completed much of the analysis and are moving on to implementation. This was no small task and commend the internal teams that worked so diligently to get us where we are.","We do anticipate additional costs as we work through the implementation phase including those related to third-party assistance from industry experts and counsel, digital enhancements to adopt the rule in our platform and increased legal and compliance costs. Importantly, we are well-positioned to be fully compliant within the DOL stated implementation dates and these expenses are included within our target operating margin for the year.","And now, a note on governance. A couple of weeks ago, we further strengthened our board with the addition of Kevin Kabat. Kevin's extensive background and financial services rounds up our board, which now stands at 12 members. Kevin spent more than 30 years in the industry, including the last eight years as CEO of Fifth Third Bancorp. In addition, he has experience on a number of boards both public companies and charitable organizations. We are fortunate to benefit from his insights, particularly as we position the company to cross $50 billion.","So, in summary, it's been a solid first half of the year. And while I'm pleased with where we stand, we have plenty to accomplish in capital deployment, growth, expense management, and our primary mandate, which is to serve the retail investors. On all fronts, I'm excited about what's in store for the remainder of this year.","And with that, I will turn it over to our sapient CFO, Mr. Pizzi.","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Mr. Idzik.","For the quarter, we reported net income of $133 million or $0.48 per share. This compares to adjusted net income of $122 million or $0.43 per share in the prior quarter, which excludes the $31 million income tax benefit. It also compares to adjusted net income of $72 million or $0.25 per share in the year ago quarter, which excludes a $220 million income tax benefit.","Revenues for the quarter were $474 million, up $2 million from the prior quarter largely related to higher yields on customer assets held by third parties and up $45 million from the year ago quarterly largely attributable to the benefits from our wholesale funding termination and the Fed rate hike.","Net interest income was $286 million for the quarter down $1 million from the prior quarter as a 17 basis point reduction in net interest margin was mostly offset by a $2.5 billion larger average balance sheet. Our net interest margin of 264 basis points decreased as we put money to work, growing our balance sheet in unspectacular rate environment and as average margin balances contracted.","The rate environment is certainly impacting us with our average reinvestment rate now in the range of 150 basis points to 175 basis points. We continue to expect our full year net interest margin to be 260 basis points to 265 basis points with the back half of the year in the mid-250s basis points. This also assumes no change in the Fed funds rate, and that margin balances remain constant with their current level.","Commissions, fees, and service charges and other revenues were $178 million, up $3 million from the prior quarter and up $11 million versus the year ago quarter. Compared to Q1, commissions revenue decreased $1 million as lower trading activity was offset by higher average commission per trade, which increased $0.18 to $10.82 driven by a higher portion of stock plan customer trades and more options contracts per trade. Relative to the year ago quarter, commissions revenue increased $3 million on higher trading activity, partially offset by a $0.14 decline in the average commission related to a higher mix of active traders.","Fees and service charges revenue increased relative to both the prior quarter and the year ago quarter, primarily attributable to higher reorg fees and higher yield on customer assets held by third parties. This quarter, the average yield on those assets was 41 basis points, up 11 basis points from Q1. As Paul mentioned, we expect to convert approximately $4 billion of money market funds into our cash sweep program in September.","Securities and other gains were $10 million, flat with the prior quarter. For the full year, we expect gains to be near the high end of our $30 million to $40 million range. Non-interest expense for the quarter was $295 million, down $17 million sequentially, with the biggest driver being a seasonal decline in marketing. Expenses were about $7 million below our expectations due to a further pull back in marketing in response to the environment and a small benefit running though communications expense.","Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 38%, up from 34% in Q1 as revenues rose slightly and expenses decreased significantly. Our commitment to manage to an operating margin requires us to govern our expense base closely and while our operating margin improved, there is much more work to do as our revenue continues to face environmental headwinds from low interest rates.","With a rational expense structure already in place and a discipline to marketing spend, we are committed to regularly reviewing productivity where output can be achieved with leaner resources. While this effort is ongoing, the current revenue environment makes our commitment to respond all the more important, and we are steadfast in supporting our operating margin target of 37% for the year.","Moving onto the provision line, we recorded a benefit of $35 million for the quarter, once again better than expected. Net charge-offs were positive at $6 million of recoveries, contributed to the $29 million reduction and the allowance of $293 million while the overall portfolio reduced by $300 million or 6%, ending the quarter at $4.4 billion.","Recoveries continued to be a significant factor propelling provision benefit. As we have said in the past, recoveries and the recapture of previously charged-off loans are exceptionally difficult to predict and can meaningfully swing our results. We also continue to benefit from better than expected performance of higher risk loans that have been reserved for the full life of loan. This quarter, we had a relatively small amount of HELOC conversions at just over $50 million. Overall, the performance of conversions remains consistent with an average default rate of approximately 12%, about twice that of a non-converting loan.","At this point, about $0.7 billion or 45% of the HELOC portfolio has yet to convert. Nearly all of those occur over the next three quarters, with a fairly even distribution across each. So, while we are pleased with the performance of HELOC conversions to-date, we have a sizeable amount left to convert and we do expect losses to increase as a result. We believe we are adequately reserved for the losses and thus expect provision to be zero through the remainder of the year, with a caveat that many of the variables I just covered can have a meaningful impact on the provision results.","Moving onto capital, we distributed $190 million up to the parent during the quarter, comprising the following: $85 million from the bank, which is below Q1 net income of $108 million, as we utilized capital to fund balance sheet growth; and $102 million from the brokers, comprising $27 million from the introducing broker and $75 million from the clearing broker.","In Q3, we expect total dividend to the parent of roughly $125 million, which includes $40 million from the bank, again below current quarter bank net income of $106 million, as we will use capital in Q3 for balance sheet growth; $57 million from the introducing broker and $28 million from the clearing broker. As with last quarter's move, capital is being released from the clearer as its needs have reduced.","We are currently in the process of merging our two broker dealers, so starting in the fourth quarter, we will have a single brokerage entity to distribute capital to the parent. Without going into too much detail, the entities were separated about 15 years ago for operational reasons that are no longer relevant. The combined entity will streamline our organizational structure and regulatory oversight. In terms of capital, we expect future distributions to be consistent with that historically distributed out of the introducing broker.","So, on to capital generation. We ended the quarter with strong measures at the both the bank and parent. The bank's leverage ratio ended the quarter at 8.2%, above our current 8% target. Keep in mind that we intend to seek approval to lower this target to 7.5% early next year. At the parent, we ended the quarter with a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 7.5%, above our minimum of 7%, and the other metric by which we measure available capital, corporate cash, ended the quarter at $523 million, well above our minimum of $100 million or two years of debt service coverage. So, we are in a strong position to continue deploying capital.","We remained active on that front in the quarter, repurchasing $151 million of our common stock and growing the balance sheet by $1.3 billion. We have now completed more than $500 million of our $800 million share repurchase program, having repurchased 5.9 million shares during the quarter and 20.6 million over the course of the entire program at an average price of $24.34.","On balance sheet growth, we ended the quarter at $49.2 billion, just shy of our current target of $49.5 billion of consolidated assets. To expand on Paul's comments regarding our plans to exceed $50 billion in the first half of next year, after converting the money market funds to our sweep program in September, on a pro forma basis, we have approximately $6 billion of deposits readily available to bring on balance sheet, assuming no organic growth between now and then. That amount puts crossing $50 billion squarely within economic reach.","From a capital perspective, we anticipate funding this growth through earnings and a lower bank Tier 1 leverage threshold. There are a host of reporting changes and filing requirements we will enjoy with our increased size, all of which we are currently digging through. We will provide updates on these on future calls.","With respect to incurring the expenses related to crossing, it is still too early to assign precision to timing. However, our rough estimates assume $50 million related to the build-out, with around $5 million incurred in the second half of this year and the remainder evenly spent in 2017 and 2018, and the running cost of approximately $15 million per year will start to occur in 2017 with a full run rate in 2018. Needless to say, with the right amount of deposits at our disposal, the returns are quite compelling and we are excited to unshackle our growth.","And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. You may proceed with your question.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah. Good evening, Paul. Good evening, Mike. A question on the SIFI strategy, you laid out a good amount of the detail. I guess the question is, first, what's the incremental margin, at least currently, that you'd expect to get on the $6 billion of, I guess, new sweep deposits? And then, I know there is still a lot of talk about potentially with a new administration bumping up that SIFI limit, what would be the plan if it got increased to, I don't know, well into $100 million or above?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'll handle the incremental margin. At today's yield curve, the marginal investment rate's about 150 to 175 basis points. So, that would be a rough proxy of the investment yield. So, we wouldn't expect to do anything with these deposits and the deposits we currently have. We're paying about 1 basis point interest, around roughly 8 basis points or so to the FDIC. You can net all that down and you can get sort of what the incremental net interest margin that the deposit will provide. Against that, though is obviously the expenses that we have to take, which we just talked about in terms of timing.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Rich, with regard to the second part of your question, after Mr. Pizzi and I finished the bottle of champagne, we'd be able to unravel some of the infrastructure we had to put in place to support these deposits, and if it took place right at the beginning of the year, we wouldn't have to wait to build up the additional deposits. We'd bring them all immediately on balance sheet.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And I guess one follow-up, Matt (sic) [Mike] (23:13) on the NIM. In this current interest rate environment, any further updates of what your \u2013 what would you expect in the NIM over the next couple of quarters?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, we...","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Michael, would you answer that?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. We were 2.81% in the first quarter. We're 2.64%. We're still holding guidance for the year that we originally gave, but that really puts us in the \u2013 in sort of the mid-250s basis points over the rest of the year.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Securities. You may proceed with your question.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi. Good evening. So, Mike, I appreciate all the detail on the different puts and takes supporting the decision to pursue the Pizzi pounce. However, the crossover is highly sensitive to reinvestment rate assumptions. And I'm just wondering given the range that you're giving in terms of reinvestment yields, if you stay at the lower end of that range, at 150 basis points, does that impact at all the timing of your decision?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Not really. I mean, in that range of 150 basis points to 175 basis points. I mean, I think we have to have some confidence that we're not going to continually go lower than what we've seen here post Brexit, is hopefully \u2013 is going go to hold the sort of the lower range in yields. If we're within that range, I mean, you can do the math at a 7.5% capital hold, what that really equates to as a spread and what incremental return that's generating on the marginal capital. We feel that's a pretty reasonable use of capital at that level and that's the right decision to begin the work and to begin incurring the costs to support levels greater than $50 billion.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","All right. And are you assuming a 7% capital target, i.e., longer term target versus the current level that you're managing to today?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We're at 8% right now for the bank. We are minimum of 7% for the consolidated company. The only item that we have sort of in the immediate sight is really to try and get the bank to a level of 7.5% early next year. And beyond that, we'll have to see.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Got it. And you alluded to M&A opportunities in the past. I'm wondering whether the decision to cross the SIFI threshold actually impedes your ability to do any acquisitions? And on the flip side, did that actually create any obstacles for a potential bidder if someone comes with an offer that's actually attractive enough?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Steven, I could see how that might cause you to furrow your brows and come up with that. But we believe if the deal would come along that was attractive to our shareholders, it would be attractive to finance as well. And so, we don't think of one versus the other. Putting things on the balance sheet is good long-term attractive growth, good for our shareholders. If we were to find an acquisition that was attractive, that we thought was good for the shareholders, we'd do that. And no, I don't believe either of these things we're talking about will make us less attractive to a potential acquirer.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks. And just last one for me. And Mike, it's a bit of technical one on the balance sheet, but looking beyond 2016, one of the questions we're getting most often is, if we're to assume a static yield curve and just looking at the maturity schedule of your securities book and assuming a steady pace of loan run-off, what will be your reasonable expectation for NIM compression beyond 2016, recognizing that there are going to be some reinvestment headwinds, all else equal?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, you can take a look at the securities yields, right, and compare them to kind of where we are at the margin, which is that 150 basis points to 175 basis points. Now keep in mind that's on a fairly depressed yield curve as we ended the quarter. That was 175 basis points to 200 basis points in the prior period. So, hopefully we get some degree of normalization off these post Brexit lows. But if we don't \u2013 you can model it over the average life of the securities portfolio to becoming down in line with the life of the portfolio that we're going to recycle into the marginal rate on the securities book, keeping in mind that both stock lending and margin will continue to support higher spreads than just what the security is generating on the margin.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Really helpful, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Pleasure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Conor Fitzgerald with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.","Conor Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for taking my question. So, it looks like the Tier 1 leverage at the HoldCo has kind of become your binding constraint. And I think I heard your comments that you'll fund the growth to $55 billion through retained earnings partly. I guess can you just help us understand how we should think about the pace of the buyback over the next couple of quarters, considering the growth you're thinking about?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, as you can see the amount of corporate cash we have available today and the buffer we have over 7% today is almost enough to complete the buyback program. Given the timing to say sort of first half of next year to break $50 billion, with the bank possibly moving down from 8% to 7.5%, we can fund the organic or balance some of that organic balance sheet, roughly about half, with the decline in the ratio at the bank. The rest will have to come through retained earnings at the bank, and then that will support also the capital ratio at the parent level. So, we have the ability to complete the current buyback program and still break through $50 billion in the timing, if we were able to achieve the assumptions within our capital plan.","Conor Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. And then, not to beat a dead horse, but just to make sure I've got the moving pieces right on the $50 billion, going over $50 billion. Once I factor in kind of the lost money market fees, if the NIM is at the low end or below the 150 basis points range you're talking about, factoring in the lack of the kind of foreground opportunity cost from a buyback, the return seemed, I guess, marginal would be the word I would use. Can you just talk about, again, maybe going back to Steven's question, but just how sensitive you guys are to that reinvestment rate?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I mean, if you start to go materially below the 150 basis points to 175 basis points range, you start talking about maybe 1% gross, so netting the money fund yield off that, it starts to become much more of a wash overall. And I think you're right in sort of pointing out that if you get below that range, the math starts to go the other way. But so long as we're within that range, we're comfortable that this is the current use of capital.","Conor Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then just last one, just a technical one. The yield on the loans are a little better than I think, at least I had thought. I guess, can you give a little color on what drove the improvement quarter-over-quarter? And second is 4% still the...","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, it's lags on the LIBOR resets in the ARM portfolio starting to come through, and then really just the billing cycle on some of the home equities from the end of the year just catching up, so overall that's what's driving it on the quarter.","Conor Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it, so this 2Q is not a bad proxy for the rest of the year?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","There's still LIBOR resets to come, right. Some of these loans are 12-month resets. So depending on the timing of their cycle, there may be some additional drift up, but it's going to be small at this point.","Conor Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. You may proceed with your question.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, guys. Maybe want to ask a different question about the efficiencies review that's kind of undergoing. Maybe if you guys can talk to us a little bit about what areas you guys are focused on and what you actually think might be a range of expenses that you'd be targeting if the environment continues to remain pretty challenged here in the interest rate environment.","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, sure. It's a bit too early to tell on range, but it's a lot of the things where we have \u2013 obviously, we've done a lot of investing over the past in our technology and our enterprise risk management and compliance, in the corporate infrastructure and even business and other facing initiatives. Whenever you come through a period of investment like that, it's time to take stock and review just to make sure we're being as efficient and possible with how we grow and put ourselves together. So overall, it's a review of our corporate and management structure, that really leaves out anything that's customer facing from a sales and service perspective.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And one quick one on the securities portfolio, following upon the prior questions, trying to gauge the sensitivity to reinvestment rates. How many years until the legacy securities portfolio fully rolls off?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The legacy loan portfolio?","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Not the loans, I mean the securities portfolio. Sorry, I misspoke.","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The securities portfolio is not a legacy portfolio. There's nothing legacy in it at this point. It's largely just the reinvestment of our agency securities book. So there are higher yields in there that are from past investments in higher rate cycles. But it's in line really with the average life of our liability duration, which we put in sort of the kind of high 3s%, mid 4s% area.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. You may proceed with your question.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. Good evening, guys. Maybe just another one here on the Pizzi pounce above $50 billion. Obviously, higher kind of more rigorous regulatory requirements as that occurs. I'm just curious, are you guys pretty comfortable at this point that you'll still be able to work capital ratios down over time after crossing, or is that something that you're still working through the implications on? I just want to kind of get some sense there?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Devin, I think we've been clear on these calls in the past that we think we should be operating closer to 7%. But we worked closely with our supervisors and laid our capital plans and continued to improve our enterprise risk management, and those are the things that get us in a position where we feel comfortable asking and to-date, I think we've got that timing in activity right and we're going to continue to pursue it that way.","And to be clear, even if we are not given permission to progress down the road, we're going to continue to work with our supervisors to make sure we are improving what we are doing in enterprise risk management compliance, et cetera because that's just good business.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Yeah. Okay. That's helpful. Full-time employees increased 3% in the quarter, overall head count up 5%, I know there was a bunch of consultants in there. Is that growth with the DOL or the Pizzi pounce or something else that's driving the head count?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","About a third of that is customer facing people and I'm proud to say we have now over 300 FCs because we've had a real initiative to drive that number up. And the remainder really fall into to two categories, one is sort of project related, specific activity related and so we expect to see those numbers come off a bit going forward, and we have some summer interns on board as well that are in the numbers. And by the way, we're going to change the name in future quarters from consultants to contingents, because they're really more contingent workers helping on things like IT et cetera.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. Great. And then a last one on some of the normalization, maybe we're seeing in the securities lending yields. I mean, is that just a function of kind of where demand is for hard to borrows? I'm just curious from a modeling perspective, whether that could tick back up or this seems like a pretty good level.","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You hit it right. It's the amount of hard to borrows. It's what's hard to borrow and the levels that we're getting on it and it continues to fluctuate.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Got \u2013 I mean, did that change at all post Brexit? It seemed like maybe that could have improved but I'm curious if there's any color there.","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's been volatile with the markets, is probably the best way to describe it. It's too early to tell where it's going to end up at.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. I guess, first question is on the provision outlook. Just curious as to what your assumption is for recoveries, if it continues? I think the last couple of quarters you've highlighted that as being the positive. Are you assuming that continues, or there's some improvement in recoveries or are you not \u2013 just curious about...","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Dan, as I said in our prepared remarks, it's a phenomenon that's very difficult to predict. These are recoveries from loans that were pretty much written off and forgotten and we were surprised to see some money come back on them. So our provision estimates going forward don't assume any recoveries, nor are we quite frankly allowed to assume any recoveries in the model.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Got it. And then, Mike, you mentioned a small benefit in the communications line for expenses. Can you just quantify that? Are there any other kind of one-time things in this quarter that you would point out?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'd just say a good run rate for communications is about $22 million. It's related to a couple of items that were related to data charges that came through last year. And it's just \u2013 it's reversing in the current period.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Got it. And then just lastly, in terms of the expenses and the outlook. The $5 million you highlighted with the threshold \u2013 going over the threshold for the second half, that's inclusive of the guidance, of your margin guidance still for the year?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Consider the $5 million in our current operating margin guidance.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed with your question.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. So, just maybe to go back on the decision to go over $50 billion. How do you think about that in conjunction with re-upping the stock buyback program beyond $800 million? Are they mutually exclusive or do you feel you can do both?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I mean, if you think about it this way, if we're successful in getting from 8% to 7.5% that's going to be about $180 million of capital free up, that will support about $2.4 billion of balance sheet or so. You need about roughly the same amount to get to the amount of balance sheet we're talking about. So, you can do the math in terms of total capital generation that we're putting up. There's still going to be some excess capital. So, what we do with that capital, we'll have to see, but there is room to continue buybacks at some level.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the operating margin target of 37%, I know you're not giving guidance today for 2017, but would you assume you'd be able to maintain that even with the extra spend on the going over $50 billion?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, going over $50 billion is going to generate incremental revenue. We're doing a lot of that work right now, because we got to get some of the precision on the timing of that spend. So it's too early for me to give you an overall operating margin target. But as we work through our planning process, specifically our budget and capital planning process, we'll have more to update you on at the Q3 and Q4 calls.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks. And maybe just one last one on the broader banking strategy, Paul, that's great you get Kevin on board. Maybe if you can talk a little bit about how you're envisioning either making retail customers more aware of your current banking capabilities or expanding them and maybe just include that with any update on your thoughts about your priorities for acquisitions if you were to do them.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Our priorities for acquisitions have remained consistent with when we started chatting with you all. I mean, number one, on the hit parade would be finding brokerage opportunities to help add to our scale in our core business. The second would be find opportunities to do the same in our corporate services business or lines that would be tangential to that corporate services business to the stock plan administration business.","And finally are things that we think about that are attractive in the banking space without any credit exposure with things such as payments is the one that most often comes to mind when we think about this because there's some interesting things happening in the fintech space, but that's what we're thinking about.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And just for the retail bank offering, is there a plan to make a broader advertising or sort of campaign push to make people aware of that and improve the...","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We really have the banking product line for the convenience of our customers. And so, that's the reason we have it. We occasionally think about doing JVs with other parties to potentially supplement some of those products but again staying away from any credit exposure.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Okay. Great. Thanks. Thanks very much.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed with your question.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks, guys. Paul, just on the banking strategy. You mentioned the two things that you guys are focused on in terms of making that leap with both rates and obviously the growth being able to surpass that $50 billion. So when I think about rates or whatever they are, but on the surpassing the $50 billion, you had that chunk that you can bring over, I just want to confirm the plan is like 1Q 2017. Now I guess more importantly just longer term, when you think about the growth rate in that business for what you're doing whether it's in the stock plan business, what you're doing with the robo, just the core business, and maybe just given the restrictions over the past couple of years, it's hard for us to see like what the cash growth has been, but any color on what you think, the firm is able to generate over the longer term given the investment that you've made?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I think if I understand your question correctly, overall, we're going to have this large amount or $6 billion that we are going to convert. Organic growth continues to grow with every account as the FDIC in sort of sweep product is the marginal cash product just about every customer today. So, whether they're coming from stock plan or whether they're coming from organic channels, we continue to grow that cash. With roughly about 17% of an account in the form of cash, cash will grow as we grow the total number of accounts. Cash does move quarter to quarter. And it does move up and down but overall it's been a growing trend as we grow our business.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's helpful. Yeah, I was just trying to get at, given that strategy, is there anything when you think about the net new asset growth, Paul, you mentioned the 300 new FCs. Obviously, you've been focused on trying to continue to grow the net new assets, but just the cash angle, if there was anything that was more focused there? And then I guess just last one, just on the robo offering. There's a lot out there on kind of the pure plays, your competitors, the big waterhouses. So just how are you differentiating and probably more importantly how are you marketing and what do you think in terms of your current customer base adapting versus bringing in new customers, particularly related to the DOL because there might be some market dislocation there?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Mike, first of all, we're differentiating the product mainly in three ways. One, it's the only product out there that offers both active and just passive management for the client to choose which one they want. Secondly, with only 1% cash requirement, putting more of each dollar of investment to work for our customers, meaning that's a very nice value proposition. And third, unlike people who work at Bank of America or anyone else on this call, many of our customers do need help with their accounts and what's happening in tax season. And so rather than some of the pure plays, we're also there for them when they want to call us and talk about what's happening.","Interestingly, as we've started this product, which was sadly lacking from our families of products, we're seeing people come, look at the site, and in addition to looking at robo finding out that they're also opening sometimes in conjunction with or sometimes instead of opening a self-directed account. So, anything we can do to get new customers and existing customers to really think about what's the right way to position their portfolio we think is just an important service to provide. It's going to pay off well for us in the future.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hill with Barclays. You may proceed with your question.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good evening guys. I just wanted to follow up on that last one with adaptive portfolios. I mean, you just covered a little bit about how you're thinking about the customers coming in. But as the customer progresses through the lifecycle and evolves with the product, do you guys have anything in place right now which may alert you or might be a scream which says this customer would be more open to a financial consultant relationship or getting more broader advise longer term, and what do you think that could do for some of the other products over time?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Mr. Hill, we do have those indications and the team is on top of those. So clearly, you don't have an account with us because you would have gotten called knowing your net worth. But we're happy when we get them in the hands of an FC because once they reach a certain level, the FCs who are able to grow that book to be five times more productive than a completely un-FC-ed account.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Just one follow-up too. On the $100 million, I think you said you had in there before and you said that was seeded with some of the legacy assets. How much of that was made up of legacy, and how much has just been new people coming to the platform?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Legacy is about 60% of that. Remember, we launched in June and so 40% new.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Pleasure. Thank you for calling in.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen, with Buckingham Research. You may proceed with your question.","Chris Allen - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Good evening, guys. Just a couple of quick ones. Just on the fees and service charges you mentioned reorg fees as a driver as well as higher rates there. Anything to think about going forward in terms of normalization of reorg rates and then obviously, you would be \u2013 pulling out the deposit \u2013 off-balance sheet deposits. Just wondering like anything \u2013 maybe one-time impact to the reorg in this quarter?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Reorg was worth about $1.4 million. It was really related to a couple of key transactions in the market. Obviously, those are pretty hard to forecast. So as transactions come that have fees for the M&A reorganization, that will bounce around a bit.","Chris Allen - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got it. And then just on the pre-tax margin guidance, I'm thinking about kind of expense run rates. Given the NIM outlook you've given us and thinking about lower trading revenues just in terms of \u2013 from a seasonal perspective, it would seem that it kind of implied that we're going to see a little bit higher expenses, although I'm trying to envision how that's possible just with the environment, putting aside the $5 million, just any color there?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I mean, you do have lower spread coming from the yield curve but you'll have a full quarter benefit of the larger balance sheet on an average basis coming into the next quarter. So, overall with where we are on expenses, where we're tracking with balance sheet, what the environment is like, obviously DARTs can go up and down. We still feel pretty confident in the 37%.","Chris Allen - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Good. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","There are no further questions over the telephone lines at this time. I will now hand the call back to you.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you. I'd like to thank everyone for calling in. We appreciate the time you spent with us.

Good evening and thank you for joining us. As always it is a pleasure to share my thoughts with you. Later, Mr. Pizzi will dissect the quarter. But first, I\u2019d like to spend some time reflecting on what has been by all accounts a banner year at E*TRADE.","An adjusted net income of $340 million or $1.17 per share represents the company\u2019s strongest financial performance in nearly a decade, and is the product of exceptional efforts by our colleagues across the organization. We\u2019ve come so far as a company to bolster our financial and competitive positions, and in the hall of accomplishments the 2015 display case houses some of our most celebrated and hard earned trophies.","During the year, our risk profile exhibited the stuff function improvement, as the continued reduction in legacy assets was marked by two consecutive quarters of lowering reserves, while our demonstration of enhanced enterprise risk controls among other things helps solidify our regulatory standing.","We embarked upon four major capital deployment actions emblematic of our improved position and greater flexibility. And most importantly, we focused on the customer experience bringing several digital enhancements and offerings to market while further sharpening our focus to the discontinuation of noncore businesses.","To start with our financial position, based with tremendous opportunity my colleagues rose to the challenge exchanging even our own demanding expectations. To provide a highlight reel of our triumphs, we kicked off 2015 announcing regulatory approval to reduce our banks tier 1 leverage ratio by 50 basis points to a level of 9%. We reduced and refinanced our corporate debt to our target level of $1 billion at a blended average coupon of 5%, the lowest in company history.","Simplified our operating structure by extracting our broker dealer subsidiaries from the bank, which now serve as a more efficient source of capital for the parent, distributed more than $800 million of excess capital to the parent, terminated costly legacy funding sources from our balance sheet markedly improving its profile and returns while creating capacity to fuel growth with core customer deposits.","To begin the process of growing the balance sheet to a target of circa $49.5 billion. Put in place, we began executing on an $800 million share repurchase program and finally announced yet another approval to reduce our targeted bank leverage ratio in early 2016, this time by 100 basis points to 8%, a full year ahead of expectations.","Our accomplishments numbered large and were significant in scope and we ended the year in a bountifully stronger position than we began in and frankly better and stronger than the company has been in more than a decade. Notably our progress resulting position were recognized by our regulators and rating agencies across a few dimensions.","First, the MOUs at both the bank and parent were lifted early in the year, next reflective of our much improved risk profile and regulatory standing; our FDIC insurance rates were cut by more than half.","And finally, we received investment grade credit ratings for the first time in company history following seven notches of cumulative upgrades from our two covering agencies during the year with a BBB designation from S&P in August and Moody\u2019s following suit in December.","While it is more than a pleasure to look back on these achievements, make no mistake that we are acutely focused on what is next, marked by our unwavering commitment to be faithful stewards of shareholder capital. To that end, we are currently in the midst of executing two important initiatives; first we are steadily marching towards our target balance sheet size of 49.5 billion which we expect to achieve in the second quarter.","Second, we are actively executing on our $800 million share repurchase program announced in November. Through year end we have purchased $50 million and in January to date we have put another $26 million to work.","Meanwhile we continue to evaluate other possibilities for capital deployment. Beyond making prudent investments in the business chief among these possibilities are potential acquisitions. I have mentioned that we think of these in three broad categories of which two continue to rise to the top of the list. Those are scale acquisitions in the brokerage business and opportunities to better capitalize on our customer deposits through banking.","On the brokerage side we have superior platforms and systems in place and utilizing the scale inherent they are in is attractive. On banking we see value in optimizing our low cost stable deposits through a more traditional approach. While an abundance of small and medium sized opportunities exist in these areas, we are staying highly objective with an eye on delivering compelling returns on capital ensuring our customers will be well served and remaining closed towards digital ethos [ph].","As we examine specific opportunities, management and our board pass each through a robust filter ensuring our heightened standards for risks, our demonstrated commitment to creating value for shareholders and our regulatory standing are the forefront of any decisions. Irrespective of acquisitions, as we think about both growth and capital deployment, we have started the work on sizing the implications exceeding $50 billion in assets. While I remain hopeful that logic wears its noble head and that certain regulations might change we take a more pragmatic approach to managing our business.","Accordingly, I talked to Mr. Pizzi and team with understanding all elements of crossing this threshold from systems, to reporting, to personnel and most relevant for your purposes cost. While there is still a lot of analysis to do and the numbers will be refined, initial estimates suggest about $50 million over two years related to getting in shape with an additional recurring component of approximately $15 million annually. Keep in mind that not all of these costs specifically those related to the initial build out would have immediate P&L impact. Mr. Pizzi will cover more on that later.","These costs are certainly not insignificant and as we note in our numerous occasions kept tolling over the 50 billion lines won\u2019t benefit our owners particularly in the current rate environment. However with cost and benefits will clearly define we will be able to make an informed decision considering rates, growth and return on capital, so we are spending a healthy amount of time working through this exercise for the avoidance of any doubt our intent for the foreseeable future is to manage our balance sheet to our stated target and not cross into the nifty land of 50.","While on the top of expenses the team has completed the budgeting work for 2016 and I like to give some color on how we are thinking about spend going forward. We have made a lot of important investments in the business over the past few years in particular fortifying the company\u2019s risk and control framework in line with our enhanced expectations, bolstering our foundations through improvements to systems and infrastructure and finally upgrading talent.","With much of the foundation of work complete we have really just begun to shift our dollars to chip away into the ring enhancements truly geared towards improving our competitive position. Today, with this more rational expense structure we are transitioning the way we think and talk about overall spending to be more directly in line with the revenue environment meaning operating margin. And this measure for 2016 we expect it to be 39%. There is substantial upside in a more normalized rate environment where our target should move to the mid 40s range. While Mr. Pizzi will share additional thoughts and expenses in the coming quarter, I wanted to accentuate a revamped approach on the matter.","Turning to our business metrics, customer activity rates slowed in its global and macro economic uncertainty during the year with DARTs of 155,000 down 8% from 2014. Q4 continued the trend of moderation as DARTs of 147,000 were down 6% from the third quarter. Options during the quarter were stable at 24% of total DARTs consistent with our full year mix.","In January to date, we have seen uptick in training activity amidst volatile markets and in line with seasonal patterns. Through yesterday DARTs are tracking up 26% from December. Despite uncertainty in the markets our customers showed confidence when they acted as there were net buyers of $6.8 billion to securities during the year and maintained relatively healthy margin balances throughout and in the year at $7.4 billion.","For the quarter, margin balances averaged $7.5 billion down from $8 billion last quarter. Recently, we have seen a decline to about $7 billion. Despite the macroeconomic were [Indiscernible] our core franchise also continued its steady growth adding 13,000 net new brokerage accounts during the fourth quarter bringing the full year total to 96,000 after we adjust for unique items.","Our adjusted attrition rate for the quarter of 8.2% improved from 9.3% in the prior quarter and brings our full year adjusted attrition rate to 8.9% in line with 2014 in a range that we think is healthy given our business model.","We brought in $2.8 billion of net new brokerage assets during the quarter which was up from $2.1 billion in the third quarter and brings our full year total to $9.3 billion representing a 3.8% growth rate. Importantly, approximately one third of those net new assets were closed into retirement accounts.","Retirement investing and savings continue to represent a key component of our future growth. Both are challenge and our opportunity is to better engage with customers to broaden their awareness and showcase our capabilities as a provider of investment solutions for both the near and long term focus.","We ended the year with $48 billion of retirement assets with our 880,000 retirement accounts, both of which increased modestly during the year. We also earned $3.2 billion of assets and managed accounts which we think compliments this component of our business quite nicely.","Another tremendous area of opportunity for us is our stock plan administration business. We continue to invest in this business during the year and completed the transition of clients onto our award winning Equity Edge Online platform. During the year, we added 144,000 net new accounts in this business and ended the year with 1.4 million planned participants.","Turning to the enhancements we\u2019ve made to our digital store front and co-platforms leading with etrade.com, we launched a new welcome page for perspective customers to better deliver a value proposition the moment a window shopper steps into the store. While it is in early days we have seen an improvement in the funding rate for new accounts directed to this page. It is up over 2.5 percentage points compared to our prior experience.","Once in the door, all customers were met with several overhaul sections of our site including a revamped account overview page, our new retirement center which provides a simpler interface and a writing content to help customers engage, take charge and keep their goals on track. Our new tax center, which brings more efficiency and ease to a process that is notoriously stressful and convoluted.","And finally, this morning we announced the introduction of tip ranks to our platform. And listening to the customers we heard a strong need to help navigating the scores of public content across social and financial channels. The two which represents analyst sentiment on individual stocks and then ultra clear way takes a unique algorithm based approach to analyzing and aggregating recommendations for more than 3,700 sell side analysts and 4,500 financial buyers.","Turning to our active trader platform E*TRADE Pro, we made a number of upgrades to further equip retail investors with professional grade tools. The big ticket items include a new options analyzer which simplifies very complex strategies. In addition to a new streamline design, the revamped tool enables traders to build multiple options strategies, run through various strike and date scenarios, customize graphing features and more seamlessly submit any strategy for trading.","And our new margin analyzer which provides greater clarity by way of a new detailed overview of buying power, displaying real time requirements for each position in a customer\u2019s portfolio.","Lastly is Mobile, which continues to become a more prevalent component of our offering as Mobile DARTs were a record 14% of total DARTs in 2015 and 15% in Q4. Customers seek an experience that rivals the desktop in terms of power and depth, and this year we delivered robust enhancements to further empower customers on the go.","Some of the more noteworthy features we added this year include, conditional orders to help customers more nimbly seize opportunities based on different market conditions, multi leg options to execute complex strategies, a Bespoke [ph] mutual fund trading experience and mould that embraces the unique form factor and several new technologies available on Apple products including home screen support and iOS, Apple Pay and of course our Apple Watch app we were the only broker among our peers to offer account level data.","When it comes to the progress of our digital offering where we see significant third party recognition this year including running four out of five stars overall and variance 2015 broker review, three first place awards along with five best in class ratings in stockbrokerage.com 2015 review. And for the fourth year running Equity Edge Online was rated number one for client satisfaction and loyalty by Group 5.","So in summary, 2015 was a great year for E*TRADE. We are very proud of the accomplishments we made but recognize there is more to do to drive growth in the metrics and I know we can do better. So as we turn the page to a new year, I\u2019m enthusiastic about the many initiatives we have underway to enhance our offering and grow our franchise, all while keeping focused on continuing to deliver value for shareholders. I am eager to share our progress along the way and I am confident 2016 will be another great year for E*TRADE.","And with that, I will turn it over to impavid CFO, Mr. Pizzi.","Michael Pizzi","Thank you, Mr. Idzik. I\u2019ll start with our results. For the quarter we reported earnings of $89 million or $0.30 per share. That compares to $98 million or $0.33 per share in the prior quarter after excluding the impact of the wholesale funding transaction. It also compares to adjusted net income of $78 million or $0.26 per share in the year ago quarter after excluding extinguishment of corporate debt.","The quarter also included an elevated tax rate of 43% largely related to the impact of our wholesale funding transaction on the full years pretax income and the associated impact on non-deductible items. We expected to return to a more normalized 38% to 40% range in 2016.","Revenues were $454 million, up from an adjusted $443 million in the prior quarter attributable to higher net interest spread but down from $461 million in the year-ago quarter as a result of lower customer activity.","Net interest income of $285 million improved $22 million from the prior quarter, driven by a healthy 30 basis point improvement in spread, primarily related to the elimination of expensive wholesale funding, partially offset by a $1 billion lower average balance sheet, again the result of the wholesale elimination.","Spread for the quarter was 288 basis points above the high 270s range we discussed on the last call as a result of better margin loan yields coupled with meaningfully slower prepayments fees within our securities portfolio.","As for 2016 spread, holding the fed funds rate constant and doing the same for our most erratic variables relative to where they ended the year, margin, stock lending and prepayment fees we expect our spread for the year to be in the 270 basis to 275 basis point range with Q1 in the high 270s. I would note that with margin relative to where it ended the year there is some downside.","Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenue were $160 million, down 10 million from the prior quarter and down $16 million versus the year-ago quarter, largely attributable to a decline in trading activity related to both periods. Average commission per trade of $10.66 declined $0.21 from the prior quarter and $0.18 from the year ago quarter. The sequential decrease was driven by a higher mix of active traders and fewer contracts for option trade. The year-over-year decline was also driven by higher mix of active traders.","Securities gains were $9 million compared with an adjusted $10 million in the prior quarter. For the full year we expect gains to be in the $30 million to $40 million though any given quarter could vary.","Expenses for the quarter were $305 million, up $12 million from the prior quarter; it goes by a couple of unique items. First, we have $6 million of executive severance within the restructuring line, second we had an $8 million onetime third party contract charge in the communications line. Excluding those two items, expenses were $291 million.","Looking ahead we are truly shifting our framework to be more aligned with the revenue environment and that is evident in the investments we are making going forward. The new investments are ones that will have a more direct impact on the growth in our business. As for the more significant drivers of the current year\u2019s expense guidance which is predicated on an operating margin of 39% they are the following: first, the impact of adding talent. We grew headcount in 2015 and will have the full year run rate of those additions as well as continued hiring throughout 2016. In 2015, many of the hirers we made related to foundational enhancements and improvements to project management.","In 2016, many of the hires we make will be related to business growth. In conjunction with this, we expect consultant headcount to decline, which is captured in professional services. Second, we plan to increase our marketing spend in the high single digit percentage range during the year. We maintain flexibility here and will be mindful of what the market conditions warrant.","And last, the impact of our reduced FDIC insurance premiums. We had a drop in our assessment rate in mid 2015 and will recognize the full benefit of that in 2016. We expect the expense to this expense to be approximately $6 million per quarter for the $49.5 billion balance sheet. So those were the pieces that will impact the full year. More specifically for Q1,we expect operating expenses to be around $310 million which includes a sequential uptick in marketing spend that combined with a smaller balance sheet will have in Q1 relative to the rest of the year will cause our up margin for the quarter to be below our full year guidance.","And to be clear on our operating margin guidance, the metric is aligned with that which we report in our key performance metrics and is the percentage we make on revenue after provision and operating expenses, meaning an exclusive corporate interest expense and other below the line items. We view this metric as an important measure of how we are managing the business.","Moving onto the loan portfolio, it ended the year at $5 billion, down 6% during the quarter and down 22% for the full year. The allowance reduced yet again as we continued to see positive performance relative to our expectations ending the quarter at $353 million, a $23 million decline from the prior quarter, this translated into a benefit to provision for loan losses of $23 million as net charge offs were zero.","With respect to HELOCs, we began 2015 with $600 million of HELOCs scheduled to convert to amortizing payments or mature during the year. We managed with the first significant volume of conversions and maturities and we now have a sizeable sample of converted loan performance to measure against our original expectations. We enter 2016 armed with even more data to forecast the performance of the future convergence and maturities.","This year we have about $800 million of our total $2.1 billion of home equity loans of which $1.7 billion are HELOCs scheduled to do so. So here\u2019s what I would emphasize on the topic. In the month that HELOC converts from an interest only to an amortizing repayment, we observe a significant increase in the rate of new 30-day delinquencies would ultimately result in a default rate approximately twice that of the non-converting population.","Translating that into actual loss terms the 24 month benchmark default rate on non converting loans has been about 6%, while those that have converted are closer to 12%. Furthermore, the charge-off occurs approximately 6 months to 9 months after the conversion event when the loan reaches 180 days past due consistent with our standard accounting process for Mortgage loan charge-offs.","And finally, our loss estimates incorporate our assumption on loans converting in 2016 are generally of poor credit quality than the average converted loans to date as national housing values peaked in 2006 when most of them were originated translating to higher CLTVs and less equity in the properties today. These conversions and their performance are the single largest factor impacting our loss modeling and while we expect charge offs to increase in 2016 we are confident with our current level of reserves and continue it to expect provision expense for the year to be near zero.","Moving onto capital, we announced four major capital deployment actions in 2015 and we are in the midst of executing on two of them, balance sheet growth and share repurchases. On balance sheet growth we expect to reach our targeted balance sheet size in Q2, at that point on a pro forma basis we would be left be about 7 billion of off balance sheet deposits. Before assuming any level of growth in the business, 2 billion of these deposits could be brought on the balance sheet at our direction. So taking this into account and again before assuming any level of customer cash growth we have the ability to cross $50 billion organically.","To expand on Paul\u2019s comment regarding the work underway to size the impact of expenses of crossing $50 billion in assets, first we would have the upfront non recurring expenses to implement the quality of the requirements associated with crossing the threshold.","More specifically, those are tied to requirements scripted under Dodd-Frank, mainly CCAR, the liquidity coverage ratio and resolution planning. Within the rough initial estimate of $50 million we are still -- we are doing much work to determine what the final number will be and what portion of that would actually flow through the P&L versus how much will be capitalized. That does not include any additional FDIC costs which will be incurred at a rate relatively in line with our cost today.","With respect to the $15 million estimate of recurring annual expenses that would be predominantly associated with additional headcount in various legal compliance and financial roles. But while we work through these calculations it is important to note that we will only cross the $50 billion threshold if doing so presents compelling returns.","Lastly, with respect to corporate cash we ended the quarter with $447 million up $15 million from the prior quarter as a $50 million dividend from E*TRADE Securities was offset by the usage of $50 million to repurchase shares. As a reminder, we intend to resume quarterly dividends from the bank and the parent in Q1 and in light of our reduced tier 1 leverage threshold to 8% to the bank this quarter we intend to request dividend in excess of it\u2019s $97 million of Q4 net income.","And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed.","Rich Repetto","Yes good evening Paul, good evening Mike. Just my first question is a follow up to the SIFI [ph] sort of research that you\u2019ve done on the cost, and when you talk about a compelling return, I just wanted to get a little bit more color of what you\u2019d sort of categorize as a compelling return. And then it looks like you would still have $2 billion in sweep or off balance sheet deposits you could add so that would give you some growth. But where could you see growth coming from on the deposit side that actually get that compelling return on the SIFI cost?","Michael Pizzi","A couple of things I would point out there Rich. One, that the $2 billion doesn\u2019t assume any growth in cash that\u2019s really where we what the calculations would be if we ran them as of 12\/31. Continuing to -- if you look at our customer cash balances overtime and a trend you will see that overtime that they have been growing. So we would expect that number to grow with our business as we grow accounts and grow customers.","The $2 billion that we have there to think about what we give as our reinvestment grade of essentially 175 basis points or so you can use that to estimate the revenue that\u2019s available on that $2 billion. When we think of returns we are not really just talking about the dollar return or margin but we have to put equity against that balance sheet. So what we are really talking about is a compelling ROE to grow the balance sheet through 50 taking into account those costs.","Rich Repetto","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I guess I\u2019m sure that you are still working through a lot of the cost here. But I guess my follow up question would be and this may not be as relevant today, but interest rate sensitivity and it seems like the other e-brokers get specific in regards to how they would be impacted by rate hikes whether they happen, whether it is likely now as before. But with the wholesale funding clean up are you able to give us a better idea of the interest rate sensitivity for E*TRADE?","Michael Pizzi","Yes, in the past with the various movements on the balance sheet, one here you could see the wholesale funding but even the changes in the composition in cost of corporate debt, the pay downs in the loan portfolio, the deleveraging project to bring our balance sheet down to get to a target capital ratio and then there is sort of releveraging or bringing the balance sheet back up in size that we are doing now. We have shied away from giving that guidance.","We are at a point now where we are completing some works and I would say stay tuned, because we are going to be coming, we\u2019ll be coming with a more fulsome disclosures around our interest rate sensitivity.","Rich Repetto","And maybe I will sneak one in for Paul if I could. On the M&A, Paul we hear a lot that is -- there was an article about a broker, private broker up for sale. Any of the properties out there as far as scale properties, do you find particularly interesting?","Paul Idzik","Rich, it\u2019s always good to hear from you, I find lots of things interesting, but you can\u2019t possibly expect me to answer that question.","Rich Repetto","I\u2019ll pass then. Thank you.","Paul Idzik","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please proceed.","Steven Chubak","Hi, good evening.","Paul Idzik","Good evening, Steven","Steven Chubak","Appreciate all the detail you guys provided on the incremental expense associated with crossing I guess what you call that nifty land at 50 threshold, so just sticking with actually the classification but if we were to take that 175 basis point spread on a newly deployed client cash, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense as to how long it would take, it actually crossed the threshold organically where the economic benefits put into would make sense","Paul Idzik","Well Steven, we -- as Michael has said we\u2019ve been doing a lot of analysis and furring our brows a bit about whatsoever we had to talk about this, but as Mike said we could go over there organically. Mike, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything that because it\u2019s difficult to forecast the way exactly Steven is describing it particularly given the impact, there was a potential rate raiser, potential new introduction.","Mike Pizzi","And I think you\u2019re thinking about in a correct way. As rates move higher the spread earned on that balance sheet will be larger, so we will need less balance to earn that compelling return. At a lower rate environment we\u2019re going to need more balance. Looking sort of those relative earnings on that, relative to a reasonable equity cost and therefore return on equity that you want to achieve as a target and I think you can back into a number.","Steven Chubak","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe just switching over back to the NIM discussion, I just wanted to get a sense as to given the guidance where you indicated a rebasing presumably in the asset yield side, if you can give some additional detail in terms of what assumptions are being made in certain items particularly those are in more volatile like stock lending but also in terms of security yields and the pro forma return?","Paul Idzik","Yes. The guidance we gave holds some of those components constant, so we\u2019re holding the margin balance constant at a rate at this level there. We are holding stock loan contribution constant throughout that calculation and then essentially running a constant balance sheet of 49.5 to give that spread guidance in the 270 to 275 basis point range. It also assumes no additional movements in federal funds.","Steven Chubak","Okay. And this one follow-on from me, but the FDIC expense guidance update that you provided, does that contemplate to step up in fees that expected later in the year?","Mike Pizzi","The run rate expense guidance does not include any step up in fees. The step up in fees is out there as an issue. We expected to have to get closer sometime in 2016. We\u2019ve incorporated it into a planning and therefore it is incorporated into the operating margin guidance that we\u2019re given you, but the run rate as we don\u2019t know the form that charge is going to take. It could be a one-time charge. It could be ongoing assessment. It could actually be an element of both. Because of that we have not factored it into the dollar guidance, but we have taken it into consideration the calculation of the operating margin.","Steven Chubak","That\u2019s it from me. Thanks for taking my questions.","Paul Idzik","Thanks, Tim.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Conor Fitzgerald with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Conor Fitzgerald","Good evening.","Paul Idzik","Good evening, Conor.","Conor Fitzgerald","Just you guys have been pretty aggressive for the share repurchase early. I just want to understand kind of your appetite for maybe using a chunk of your authorization sooner or rather than later just given what\u2019s happen with markets and kind of your stock specifically year to-date?","Paul Idzik","Well Conor as you can well expect and Mr. Pizzi will talk more of this in a bit. We\u2019re in the same quiet period requirements as a corporation as we would as an individual. And so that has some issues with regard to what we can or can do accelerating or decelerating during this period of time, but Mike do you want to.","Mike Pizzi","Yes. I think as you probably understand we are operating under plan and that\u2019s regard as throughout the amount that we\u2019ve done far this year as we entered the quiet period late in December. With that, that\u2019s been a consistent amount of purchases. With the movement in the prices and the volatility of the market it\u2019s an item of active discussion between Paul and I as to what the appropriate \u2013 what the appropriate set of actions to be when we can exit this period in a couple of days.","Conor Fitzgerald","That\u2019s helpful. And then I think you were one of the first to raise margin lending rate after the Fed hike. I\u2019m just wondering if you can give a little color on what you\u2019re seeing in the early inning in terms of your success and passing through that higher rate. Just trying to give us \u2013 to get a sense as given competition been relatively strong on margin lending balances?","Mike Pizzi","From what I understand most of our major competitors have now passed through that increase, some delayed a little bit and we are not really seeing much in the way of any movement really, but it\u2019s been largely pass-through.","Conor Fitzgerald","Helpful. And if I could sneak in, sorry. And then if I can sneak in one last more with that. That 175 number you quoted, that\u2019s net of the money market fee revenue you lost? And then just one more if you could. What do you kind of think your cost of capital is on a low risk? What was the revenue stream like this that would be helpful? Thanks.","Mike Pizzi","The 175 is the marginal rate of reinvestment. So in terms of where we are effectively buying duration match securities in today\u2019s market. Please keep in mind; yields have been exceptionally volatile as have spread, so that number is bouncing around. We could think it is range of about 175 to 2% right now. We haven\u2019t historically disclosed our cost of equity but it\u2019s actually fairly straightforward calculation from the cap end [ph] model, so in terms of where we\u2019re coming out, but I think from that you\u2019re going to get around to 10 percentage type range cost.","Conor Fitzgerald","Okay. And sorry, so the 175 is the spread revenue, but you do lose money market fee revenue in the other revenue line?","Mike Pizzi","Yes. So, if you move deposits back on balance sheet and you\u2019re buying in the 175 to 2% range you are giving up the fees that you are earning on the off balance sheet portion.","Conor Fitzgerald","I\u2019m sorry, what\u2019s that in today\u2019s rate environment?","Mike Pizzi","It\u2019s about 23 basis points.","Conor Fitzgerald","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Mike Carrier","Thanks, guys. Mike, just on the expense outlook, so I know you just mentioned on the first quarter the 310, it seems like that\u2019s a pretty decent bump up even with advertising from like the adjusted number that I think it\u2019s around 290 in this quarter. So just wanted to see what\u2019s driving that? I know you mentioned advertising and seasonal comp, but if there\u2019s anything else that gets the lift in the first quarter?","Paul Idzik","Yes. If you go back and look, you\u2019ll see the comp is always the higher in the first quarter that is really related to all the tax items and resets that go on, so that will be occurring as well, as well as the ramp up in marketing. And then some of the full year headcount really continuing, but that\u2019s really more about for the full year and not just for the first quarter.","Mike Carrier","Okay. And then, just in terms of going over the $50 billion, you guys gave the cost and I\u2019m just curious when you think about like getting positioned for that transition if you determine that make sense, like what\u2019s like the timeline in terms of getting prepared \u2013 any additional hiring, any additional system cost maybe because it\u2019s something that you guys have been planning as you been kind of revamping the infrastructure that it wouldn\u2019t take that long or are you still thinking it will take few quarters to be building that out?","Mike Pizzi","Look, I think that one, I\u2019d say, there is no decision to cross at this point. We are working on a plan, but a plan is not a decision point. I think at some point, yes, with the growth in cash it will become more and more likely decision, but at what point that is a little bit off in the future. How the rules work? Some of the CCAR rules you have five quarters to come into compliance with, so that gives an operating window of time, but obviously you want to have a very detail and well thought out plan put place before you start down that road, you have a fixed window to get it in place.","Other rules actually kick in, this is heightened expectation rules. They kick in day one when you cross 50. So, that work has to be done almost immediately, but some of that\u2019s a bit more structural and a bit easier to put in place. So, as we step back from it, you don\u2019t have -- its not going to take a full two years in terms of the expense period to go over 50, but there is going to be a period ramp up time as you\u2019re building up the plan and as you\u2019re beginning on the execution of the first phases of the plan particularly personnel to get some of this work done.","Mike Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Chris Harris","Thanks guys. Another clearly really strong quarter in credit, and I appreciate your comments about expectations on the default rates and the HELOC book. But I\u2019m just trying to square that with what you guys are actually reporting. This is a third consecutive quarter of no charge offs in the HELOC portfolio. So it seems like you guys are running way-way better than that. So, help us maybe bridge the loss experiences you\u2019re kind of reporting that versus what you think they potentially might be going?","Mike Pizzi","I can provide you a little bit of color on that. And I think the gross charge offs for the period were $21 million, that will be coming out in our 10-K when we file it. And we are seeing an elevated level of recoveries that are driving the net charge off number of zero. We expect that recovery stream to continue somewhat, but it has been exceptionally strong and we are coming up on increase conversion balances. So that really square us to have we get to the loss modeling that of course the 353 allowance.","Chris Harris","Okay. All right. That makes sense. And then the commentary around acquisitions, would you guys consider acquiring a bank that had credit risk, is that part of the potential candidates that\u2019s you\u2019re considering?","Paul Idzik","Chris, we\u2019re considering a number of things across three dimensions, right, which we\u2019ve talk on a couple of calls now. But let\u2019s remember the reason we brought this up is because we were in period of repair at the time and couldn\u2019t entertain these at all. So as the music has changed here, we wanted to make sure that were very clear with the street, with the sell-side, with our investors that we\u2019re now in a different spot and we can entertain this things. As we said today two of those three categories have emerged this, having more potential attractive opportunities and I say potential. One is certainly trying to find ways to add scale on the brokerage business because the operating leverage is so attractive.","The second is in banking, finding way to monetize the value of our customer deposits to a greater degree than we do today, and that would imply acquiring an institution that has strong capabilities and traditional intermediary activities.","Chris Harris","Okay. Helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ken Hill with Barclays. Please proceed.","Ken Hill","Hey, good evening guys.","Paul Idzik","Hey, Ken.","Ken Hill","So, I know you\u2019ve talked a lot about acquisitions here, but during the quarter I think you guys announced an expansion of your relationship with Jefferies giving clients access to Munis and you had a relationship in place on IPOs for with the year now, so are there any other in-demand products that could maybe satisfied through more of a kind of partnership than anything else?","Mike Pizzi","That\u2019s a good question, Ken. We look at partnerships all the time. We\u2019ve recently got involved in a partnership and their back office that we think not only provides customers a better service level, but provides us better economics, so we look at those all the time particularly as people produce new products. And if you think about the introduction of TipRanks today that\u2019s very much of partnership and that\u2019s providing some additional valued, educational and investing knowledge to our customers through a partnerships, so we think about those all the time.","Ken Hill","Okay. And then just modeling question here for the commission, I know you guys, it drops quite a bit and one of the peers kind of stabilized on a little bit higher. I know you mentioned some of the higher percentage of active traders this quarter. Is there anything different that you are seeing from the customer base? You guys targeting a higher group of active traders and making it earlier to them to trade out at this kind of rate that might be kind of driving that lower over time and should we expect that to stabilize some?","Mike Pizzi","Ken, we\u2019re clearly continue to invest in, for example, E*TRADE Pro which unquestionably signals the fact that we are absolutely committed to serving the needs of those valued customers and much of what you\u2019re introducing on the mobile devices is also aimed at serving that valuable client base, because they like to stay and touch and like to be able take when they want to take action.","So, our dedication to that area is very important. Our modeling on that metric which you just describer is influence by a number of factors and including the impact of corporate services businesses and a change in buying behavior somewhat in the fourth quarter people repositioned and few more mutual fund type purchases as opposed to just straight darts, straight equity trade. So there\u2019s a number of moving factors, Ken.","Ken Hill","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Mike Pizzi","I could just make one correction to an earlier comment to Conor\u2019s question. I gave the gross revenue number on the off balance sheet, the off balance sheets we\u2019ve deposits. There are fees paid in that arrangement. So when I gave the number of 23 basis points we\u2019re actually in the 10 to 15 basis point range because we have to pay the administrator fees, so it\u2019s not quite as high as that. We also expect that to go up with the full quarter now of the post the Federal Reserve increases into the 25 to 30 basis point range.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP. Please proceed.","Devin Ryan","Thanks. Good afternoon. Just a questions here on excess liquidity. If this market volatility persist, does that change your view at all round the two times debt service cushion, are you r well above that now. But just trying to think about what\u2019s truly excess? And also you\u2019re now being at the 8% Tier 1 leverage capital plan objective, that\u2019s great. Should we think about that is an ending point or is there still a goal to maybe move that lower over time?","Paul Idzik","I\u2019ll take the second first. Devin, we just got permission to take it down to 8, so you\u2019ll forgive us for one to catch our breath a bit. And I appreciate your patience, but we\u2019re going to catch our breath a bit.","We do think as a loan portfolio continues to cure, that there is some more opportunity to take down to a level that towards the seven handle, but that something that we want to carefully work through with our regulators and make sure that all the right people are comfortable before we even start entertaining that idea. The dust is just begun to settle on the trophy of getting that done, so we\u2019re going to be patience in approaching the same careful way we did in getting down to eight. And then Mike is going to take the other question.","Mike Pizzi","Yes. On the two times debt service, please keep in mind the two times debt service is actually a covenant in our revolver at this point in time, so we will not go below the 100 million number. We view corporate cash as sort of ultimate pre-source of liquidity if we need to use it between our legal entities and it also source of capital, so therefore we are not going to operate at a thinner margin in that two times level.","Devin Ryan","Okay, great. Helpful. And then just with respect to Sec lending, the balances bounce around quite bit, revenues is tend to be less volatile there. So just within the NIM guidance with that line specifically, should we just think about a revenue level being relatively constant with where it\u2019s been or just how should we think about that dynamic.","Paul Idzik","Well, in the NIM guidance we are keeping at constant. Now constant does mean the constant yield there. I mean the content overall contribution. Keep in mind, that the hard to borrow component that is essentially the rebate earned on the stock lending is put to the borrowing line and the borrowing balance is driven by customer activity. So there\u2019s going to be a lot of volatility in the yield that\u2019s posted there. But from a dollar perspective we expect to be relatively flat.","Devin Ryan","Okay, great. And then just finally to be clear here, the operating margin expectation 39% that includes provisioning I\u2019m assuming I know, there is not much expected this year but want to make sure that that objective includes provision?","Mike Pizzi","That includes provision and our guidance on provision for the year is zero.","Devin Ryan","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line Brian Bedell. Please proceed.","Brian Bedell","Hi, good evening folks, maybe just to add on to that question on the 39% op margin with the provision, should the provision varied greatly in either direction, do you view that as something that would change that operating margin or would you use that as sort of contributing to that 39% target either way?","Paul Idzik","Well, as you\u2019d expect we have to react to that when it occurs, if provisions come in above what we anticipate, we\u2019ll have to look, we may be able to reduce other cost, those numbers come in big and chunky those, so our ability to move the other numbers is not quite the flexibility you might have otherwise. And if it comes in better, we\u2019ll again take a look and see. We\u2019ve often times on these calls said we like to flex our marketing budget and when times are good invest in driving future customer growth and one times are bad being as responsible as we can, so that\u2019s a bit something we have handle day-to-day as we see what happens.","Brian Bedell","Okay. Now that\u2019s great, that\u2019s great color. And then maybe just for you Paul, in the acquisition spectrum I think actually question both to you and Mike. Mike, you can talk a little bit about financial metrics or huddles for deals that you might be following in terms of either accretion timeline or ROE? And then maybe Paul how do you feel about the RIA business, it\u2019s one o big area that you are not in and not see that scaling your capabilities? Thanks.","Paul Idzik","Why don\u2019t you take the metrics one first?","Mike Pizzi","Sure. Anything we are looking at is going to have to \u2013have to have an extremely compelling return in terms of the investment that we are making, in terms of either ROE or return on invested capital. We would also expect accretion commensurate to the","deal size and the risk in the deal, so we would expect higher metrics for deals that are going to be -- that have higher complexity or higher risk to them in terms of what we can achieve. I guess the only sort of thing I would talk about that is probably anything that\u2019s around capability or product, we haven\u2019t talk much about that, they would be on the smaller side, but any larger amount of use of capital is going to have an extremely compelling return profile on accretion.","Paul Idzik","On ROE we been pretty consistent in our thinking on this switch, not really all that intrigue by that opportunity right now for two main reasons. One, we really want to see how the department of labor regulations that are muted [ph] might turn out. That could have quite a significant impact on that business. And secondly, if you\u2019re going to go in that business I believe you need to enter that business with scale and so that would also make us think twice about that. And so for right own that\u2019s not quite in \u2013 quite at the top of our mind.","Brian Bedell","Okay. That\u2019s great color. Thank you.","Paul Idzik","I think we\u2019ll take \u2013 we have two more \u2013 two more calls please, Edison.","Operator","The next question comes from the line Andrew Del Medico with Autonomous Research. Please proceed.","Andrew Del Medico","Hey, guys. Just a follow-up on the potential bank M&A, you\u2019ve done job of de-risking the balance over the past several years. What\u2019s change in your thinking that will make you one of kind of get back in and add more credit risks now?","Paul Idzik","Well, let me just repeat that. We\u2019ve talked about potential acquisitions thinking about, not even thinking about potential acquisitions across three fronts. And I think considering the type of credit risk that we have been managing over the past several years and how it came on the books is not exactly what I would consider traditional banking business.","Andrew Del Medico","Okay. I guess what when you evaluate a potential bank acquisition, I guess what is loan channels and some assets would you really be looking at best?","Mike Pizzi","I think you want to look at when we think about think, we think about things that are kind of complement our existing business, our business model, how we go about things, the type of customers we have, will it have any residents even with the E*TRADE corporate services business. And so those are the type of applications of our thinking and the direction we\u2019re taking.","Andrew Del Medico","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Robert Rutschow with CLSA. Please proceed.","Robert Rutschow","Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. First question on expenses, it looks like your headcount was up by about a 100 little over 100 this quarter, so does the guidance for 2016 for the 39% pretax assume that you\u2019re going to see a ramp up in headcount expenses and does that means you would see some offsets elsewhere in the extend categories?","Mike Pizzi","The guidance includes our projected headcount, but it\u2019s not \u2013 the headcount projection is not \u2013 continued growth, the rate is going to slow from what it has been. So, you don\u2019t necessarily \u2013 you not necessarily going to see offsets. The hiring in the fourth quarter is very much around staffing up for the tax season or financial season that we enter this time of the year.","Robert Rutschow","Okay. And one more question on that possibly going about $50 billion. In terms of the deposits that you would want to bring on, are there any impediments that you have to change any customer agreements to bring those on balance sheet? And what would you anticipate the earning asset level to be if you were to bring on additional $2 billion in deposit?","Mike Pizzi","Well, we\u2019re working through that, I mean right now in terms of the actual conversions that are underway, you will notice that assets that are in -- of balance sheet team down as we brought some on our balance sheet. We have additional conversions that are going to occur in this quarter, I mean that\u2019s going to be a lot of process bringing us to our target level of 49.5 by sometime in the second quarter.","The additional $2 billion amount is really part o the same process if we wanted to bring it on, we could. The remaining amount for various reasons it\u2019s either in money funds that the customer has chosen to be in a tax exempt product. It is money above the FDIC insurance threshold, so be insured it has to be held by the different bank, therefore cannot be brought back onto our balance sheet. So of that seven, five of it cannot be brought back, two can be brought back that\u2019s what we gave in the prepared remarks. And then as we grow accounts and grow our business overtime we expect that too to grow.","Robert Rutschow","Great. Thank you.","Paul Idzik","Thank you. And I just like to thank all of you again for spending this last hour with us. We appreciate your interest and hope you\u2019ll have a really great evening. Good bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Good evening and thank you for joining. It\u2019s a pleasure to expand on the quarter\u2019s results and to update you on our progress. This quarter was one for the history books, as our industry attacked published commission pricing for the first time in many years. Meanwhile, we made progress on our path to deliver meaningful value to our shareholders, efficiently deploying capital and continuing in an undaunted fashion to position ourselves for improved growth.","Specifically, we on-boarded deposits to grow our balance sheet by $7 billion during the quarter, just shy of our mid-year goal. We lowered our bank Tier 1 leverage threshold to 7.5%, reflective of the regulatory progress we\u2019ve made over the years. We returned to our full year operating margin target of 38% despite reducing commission pricing.","We began to see early benefits from several initiatives we put in play over the last six months in the form of strong brokerage metrics. We delivered on much of the necessary work around the OptionsHouse integration to ensure a Q3 completion. We concluded an exhaustive process to partner with the right creative agency as we reinvigorate our iconic brand. We made significant headway in energizing our HR efforts to better support internal business partners, while improving talent acquisition. And finally, we laid more legacy issues to rest with the effective completion of HELOC conversions from interest-only to fully amortizing loans.","Let\u2019s start with the elephant in the room, commission pricing. The moves within the industry this quarter served as a stark reminder of how fiercely competitive our business is, and has been for quite some time. After three of our closest competitors lowered commission pricing within a relatively short window, we reacted swiftly and accordingly by lowering our own rates. This is not a decision we took lightly, as we truly obsess about shareholder value.","But throughout our history we have never rested in our quest to deliver an exceptional experience to our customers at a compelling value. And in an industry where pricing is the most transparent variable for customers choosing a platform, we didn\u2019t like our long-term growth prospects at a premium price point, especially while the perceived disparity in value amongst competitors widened in a very public fashion. So we took the necessary steps to defend our customer franchise, which is far and away the most valuable asset we have.","Our new structure includes a standard rate of $6.95 plus $0.75 per options contract, and an active trader rate of $4.95 plus $0.50 per options contract. Lowering our standard rate was the necessary response to the industry moves, while the changes we made for active traders was the effective pull-forward of a planned post-OH integration pricing tier. We put significant thought into the right cutoff for our more active tier and ultimately set the threshold at 30 trades per quarter, down from our previous 150 trades.","This was born from customer insight. At this level, we capture customers who actively engage with the markets, as well as those who could be compelled to execute more trades, particularly in derivatives, at a more favorable price point. Beyond price, we are working to package a differentiated service and product experience for those who qualify for this tier, which we plan to deliver post integration. As we make a concerted push to reclaim our spot as the top home for derivatives traders, we believe this structure will prove compelling and competitive for this target segment.","To summarize, this recent price battle and our response presents a temporary bump on our road, from a revenue standpoint. But we are undeterred in our objectives as we continue to charge full steam ahead, focused on accelerating the growth of our franchise. Now, to update you on how we\u2019re positioning ourselves to do just that. To reiterate, our targets are to increase our brokerage asset and account growth rates by 2 to 3 percentage points from Q3 2016 levels, grow derivatives to 35% of our trades and grow our managed assets to $6 billion. The things we are doing to achieve those goals are progressing as planned.","First, the integration of OptionsHouse. With the corporate integration largely complete, and the clearing conversion on track for Q3, we will deliver our synergy targets on schedule. Beyond that, there is more value for us to capture here as we fully capitalize on the acquisition to help us reclaim our space as the premier, undisputed home for options traders. We believe that delivering an integrated platform that combines the best of OptionsHouse\u2019s derivatives capabilities with the best of our existing technology will move us forward with this valuable customer segment.","The vision we are working hard to deliver puts additional capabilities in the hands of our customers, and also addresses the growing demands for advanced trading capabilities on the go. And it bears repeating that this integration is about much more than producing a top-notch combined platform. It is also about adopting a mindset of efficiency in product development. The notion is simple, we are relatively small, and we must remain nimble, more agile, and be able to respond to customers' evolving demands faster than the competition. ","Second is marketing. This is an initiative we absolutely must nail. We must revitalize the brand, the way our offerings are understood, and how they resonate with our customers and prospects.","We took a major step in this direction earlier this month when we tapped a new creative agency, MullenLowe. We went through an exhaustive process to select the right partner, and I am confident in the direction we are headed. Together we are developing brand messaging that will elevate our value proposition in the eyes of our current and prospective customers, while speaking to who we are as a company. Stay tuned as we look to make a splash in the next few months.","The final initiative we have in place is a bit more comprehensive. We\u2019re working to address all of our customer pain points, which is no small task for any company. While we talk a lot about new assets and accounts, keep in mind these are net numbers. We must be equally conscious about making sure that once a customer chooses E*TRADE, they never have a reason to leave.","While phenomenal customer service will always be core to our offering, we are taking the approach of addressing the most common frustrations of our customers before they ever reach a service rep. Some changes will occur through the integration process, but we have also rolled out a host of new features and offerings on our current platforms including, simplified navigation, better organizing our pages and bringing key tools and products to the forefront of our site. Continued enhancements to our most heavily-trafficked pages such as the portfolios page. A redesign of the E*TRADE mobile app to provide stock plan participants access to popular benefits and tools and significant enhancements to the OptionsHouse mobile app to improve fast paced usability and execution for options traders.","Amid all this hard work, I am very pleased to say that we are starting to see early returns reflected in our Q1 metrics which represent a tremendous start to the year. We brought in a record $4.2 billion in net new brokerage assets during the period. These strong flows continued in March following the industry price changes, giving us confidence that we are doing what is right in the eyes of our customers and that we are still very competitive in our industry. Further, the annualized growth rate of 6.1% is comfortably within the goal we set six months ago for this metric of 5.8% to 6.8%.","Managed product also continued to grow steadily, ending the quarter at $4.3 billion, up 10% sequentially. We feel good about reaching our target of $6 billion. Part and parcel with our asset success is our account growth. We posted a multi-year high in net new brokerage accounts at 58,000, more than half of our full year 2016 total in just one quarter. The annualized growth rate of 6.7% is far in excess of the goal we set forth, which was 4.8% to 5.8%. We\u2019re not claiming victory after just one quarter, especially as Q1 is a seasonally strong period, but I think these levels demonstrate just how achievable our growth goals are.","The strength of the equity markets undoubtedly boosted our metrics as strong performance instilled confidence in our customers that compelled them to meaningfully engage. DARTs of 207,000 were up 10% sequentially as broad market indices reached all-time highs. Derivatives represented a steady 29% of total DARTs, which is consistent with our expectations ahead of the launch of our fully integrated platform. In April to date, DARTs are tracking down 5% from March levels. Our customers were net buyers of $1.6 billion of securities during the quarter. This follows the prior two quarters\u2019 heavy net selling during which customers reduced their securities positions by $3.2 billion, underlining the shift in customer confidence.","This was further supported by an increase in customer margin balances, to $7.3 billion from $7.1 billion at the end of Q4. Beyond the metrics, we recently received additional validation of our efforts, having just emerged from our industry\u2019s awards season. Both OptionsHouse and E*TRADE received high marks and an assortment of accolades from Barron\u2019s and StockBrokers.com, further substantiating our offerings as among the best in the business. Barron\u2019s awarded E*TRADE and OptionsHouse each four out of five stars overall, earning a combined four Best of distinctions. StockBrokers.com also acknowledged our products and services with nine Best in Class distinctions across the two platforms. And for the second straight year, StockBrokers.com named OptionsHouse the top overall options platform in the industry. While it is nice to receive third-party validation, the true proof of our success will come after we deliver a fully integrated platform.","Turning now to our results, we reported net income of $145 million or $0.48 per diluted common share in the first quarter. Our results include a provision benefit of $14 million and one-time costs of $6 million related to the OptionsHouse integration and crossing $50 billion. Our results also reflect the power of our capital deployment strategy as net interest income was the strongest we\u2019ve posted in six years. After lowering our bank Tier 1 leverage ratio threshold to 7.5% during the quarter, we took advantage of available capital plus a favorable interest rate environment and moved deposits on balance sheet. We ended the quarter just shy of $56 billion in consolidated assets, a $7 billion increase during the quarter, outpacing our growth goals. I will let Mike Pizzi provide more details but suffice it to say we are pleased with where we stand on this measure.","In summary, we had a great quarter. There was some unexpected turbulence in the industry, but we combatted it with fortitude, and we continue to take steps to reinvigorate the growth of our customer franchise. I believe our progress here reflects something I feel on a personal level, which is a singular source of strength, that we are a Company that can be counted on to achieve the goals we communicate. We are a Company that delivers on its promises. I\u2019m excited about what we have in stored for the remainder of this year, and look forward to executing on our commitments to both our customers, and our shareholders.","With that I will turn the call over to Mike Pizzi.","Michael Pizzi","Thanks Karl. For the quarter we reported net income of $145 million or $0.48 per diluted common share. Note that this includes a $14 million provision benefit and $6 million of one-time costs related to the OptionsHouse integration and crossing $50 billion. The bottom line also reflects our first semiannual preferred stock dividend, which equates to $0.05 per common share.","Our results compare to $127 million or $0.46 per share in the prior quarter and $153 million or $0.53 per share in the year-ago quarter, which included an income tax benefit related to the release of evaluation allowance against state deferred tax assets.","Revenues for the quarter were $553 million, up $44 million from the prior quarter, reflecting balance sheet growth, a better interest rate environment, and stronger customer trading activity. Year-over-year revenues were up 81 million primarily on balance sheet growth and the addition of OptionsHouse.","Net interest income increased 11% to 319 million during the quarter as we grew average interest earning assets by 4.4 billion. With a significant amount of capital available after lowering the Tier 1 leverage ratio threshold at the bank, against a backdrop of a more favorable interest rate environment, we grew the balance sheet in a purposeful manner. Net interest margin increased slightly to 263 basis points, reflecting the full impact of the December Fed rate hike, as well as a slight benefit from the March hike. I\u2019ll expand on interest rate impact in a moment.","Commissions revenue of $127 million increased 4% quarter over quarter, driven by a 10% increase in DARTs, but partially offset by the impact of our commission reductions. While the new pricing schedule is only effective for the last three weeks of the quarter, it was the primary driver of the decline in average commission per trade, which was down $0.55 to $9.87. As a point of reference for you, pro forma for our new pricing, our Q1 commission per trade would have been $8.10. Keep in mind this includes a sequential increase related to corporate services, for which Q1 is typically the strongest quarter.","Fees and service charges increased $6 million quarter over quarter to $86 million, driven by a higher rate on off balance sheet deposits, reflecting the December increase in short-term rates. This was partially offset by a reduction in the amount of these off balance sheet deposits as we grew our balance sheet, a dynamic that should continue over the course of the year. As a reminder, OptionsHouse margin balances will no longer run through this line after conversion in Q3, as they will be reflected on our balance sheet and accordingly generate NII.","Gains increased to $10 million from $8 million last quarter, and included approximately $3 million of non-securities gains. We expect this line to return to the $5 million range next quarter. Other revenue was unchanged at 11 million for the quarter. Provision benefit was 14 million, compared to 18 million in Q4. The allowance reduced by 8 million to end the quarter at 213 million, as net charge offs were a recovery of $6 million. The loan portfolio now stands at $3.5 billion, or just 6% of total assets.","Importantly, we\u2019ve put the last remaining credit risk overhang behind us, as 96% of our HELOC portfolio is now amortizing. Given the dwindling size, complexity and risk of this portfolio, we have eliminated much of the associated supplementary information in this release, particularly that related to the performance of modified loans or TDRs, and the breakout of reserves for that population. Further detail will be available in our 10-Q.","Non-interest expense for the quarter was $342 million, up $20 million sequentially, which primarily reflects seasonality in marketing spend and compensation. It also includes one-time expenses of approximately $6 million, primarily related to the OptionsHouse integration. Our operating margin was 41%. Excluding provision benefit, our adjusted operating margin was 38%, up slightly from the prior quarter and ahead of our expectations as a result of strong customer activity, a faster pace of balance sheet growth, and higher interest rates. As for our full year operating margin, during our last call we outlined a 38% target, which we subsequently revised down to 36% when we announced our commission reductions in late March.","Now, in the wake of the Fed\u2019s March hike, our revenue forecast supports our initial 38% level. And for clarity in your modeling, achieving this target for the full year does not require targeting expenses beyond our ongoing commitment to be disciplined in our spending. Our operating margin in Q2 will be down from Q1 as a result of the commission price reduction, elevated expenses related to the OH integration, and the costs of crossing $50 billion.","As for tax, this quarter we posted an effective tax rate of 35.6% which includes a benefit related to the adoption of amended accounting guidance for employee share-based compensation. This item will likely have the greatest impact in the first quarter of each year, however there could be additional tax impact as shares vest throughout the year. We expect our full year tax rate to approximate 38%, assuming no further unique items. And finally on the P&L, I\u2019ll give an update on the impact of rising interest rates on our expectations for the remainder of this year.","First on net interest margin. We benefitted from higher short-term rates following the Fed\u2019s rate hike in March. And while the longest end [ph] of the curve didn\u2019t show the same degree of upward movement, our average reinvestment rate was firmly in the 230 to 250 basis points range. This, coupled with accelerated timing of balance sheet growth, raises our expectation for full year NIM to the low 260s. This expectation assumes no changes to the rate environment, and that margin receivables are held constant.","However, we acknowledge that broad market expectations for at least one Fed hike, if not more. If the Fed does raise rates in June and there is a corresponding increase in term rates, holding all else equal, our NIM expectations would increase by approximately 10 basis points. However, considering the intense nature of the competitive environment, we remain conscious of the potential need to amend deposit pricing following future hikes, which would obviously temper some of the NIM benefit.","As for the yield on off balance sheet deposits, in Q1 we averaged a gross yield of 58 basis points, up from 45 basis points in Q4. Today that yield is around 80 basis points, and we expect it to average approximately 90 basis points for the full year.","There are a lot of moving pieces with respect to interest rates, and I want to be clear on how we think about OP margin in this context.","Shareholders bore the brunt of the extended, and unprecedented low rate environment, and so our intent is to allow as much of this upside to reach the bottom line as possible. We believe that an additional hike in June of this year could add up to 100 basis points to our full year operating margin target. But as I mentioned a moment ago, competition remains intense within our industry, and should competitive dynamics shift again we will do what it takes to defend our franchise.","Moving on to capital, we generated and put a significant amount to work for our shareholders during the quarter. We moved 70 million from the broker to the parent during the quarter, and plan to move another 50 million this quarter related to excess capital generation during Q1. We continued to utilize excess bank capital directly at that entity to fund balance sheet growth. After crossing 50 billion in the first days of January, the interest rate environment presented an opportunity to accelerate our growth plans, and with plenty of available capital, we took full advantage. ","We ended Q1 just shy of our mid-year target at 56 billion, representing an increase of 7 billion during the quarter. This growth utilized the majority of our capital buffer, which widened after lowering the bank leverage ratio threshold during the quarter. Since we began managing to this ratio in 2012, we have been able to lower the threshold by a full 200 basis points to 7.5%, creating a substantial amount of capital for deployment, and putting us at a level we consider appropriate.","However, the bank ended the quarter well above that at 8.1%. This compares to our parent leverage ratio of 7.2%, versus our internal minimum of 7.0%. So clearly the parent has become the binding constraint. Given that we conservatively maintain a slight buffer to these capital thresholds, we expect the pace of balance sheet growth to be more measured from here and to be fully supported by organic capital generation. We now expect to be at 58 billion in consolidated assets by the end of this quarter and 63 billion by the end of this year, which is just shy of our fully-deployed balance sheet size of 65 billion, assuming all available deposits were brought on balance sheet today. Beyond that, our broad expectations are to direct all growth in customer deposits to our balance sheet, barring any abnormal patterns or net selling activity.","I want to reiterate that we are focused on putting capital to work in the ways that we believe will generate the most value. Share repurchases serve as our baseline return on capital when we consider a range of deployment strategies. We feel that, in conjunction with balance sheet growth, repurchases are our best path for long-term value generation for our shareholders.","Accordingly we continue to plan to resume share repurchases in the second half of the year, with the size dependent on the amount of capital in excess of the consolidated leverage ratio.","To close, overall this quarter, we posted solid results and we put a lot of capital to work for our shareholders. Despite the turbulence in commission pricing, our franchise didn\u2019t skip a beat, and we remain positioned to deliver on the commitments we made with respect to our operating margin and capital deployment.","And with that, operator, we\u2019ll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, [Operator Instructions] and our first question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet, please proceed with your question.","Steven Chubak","So I want to just kick things off with a question on the competitive environment, you allude to this a little bit in some of your prepared remarks, but just given the strong growth in that new assets and accounts that we saw, it certainly appears like the latest round the price cuts had little impact in terms franchise performance. Mike, you noted that you guys really didn\u2019t skip a beat and didn\u2019t really hinder your ability to make progress towards this grow targets that you guys have outlined.","I\u2019m just wondering, if you could just speak a little bit more in terms of how the competitive environment actually evolved over the course for the quarter following those actions, whether you saw any impact if it all. And if we do in fact seen another round in meaningful price cuts, you did note that you would look to defend the franchise. I\u2019m hoping you can give some additional context in terms of what specific actions you might have to take?","Karl Roessner","Sure. Looking at what went on during the quarter around the price cuts initially, it was a lot of calls from our customers and a lot of interested parties trying to figure out what was going on in the space, that was certainly no large demand for lower pricing and there was no calls before that coming into us. So there are a lot of offers and ask in the marketplace to max pricing and see if we would sort of lower down to where they were.","So like I said before sort of the hand-to-hand combat on the hire into the book to make sure that we are providing pricing. But keep in mind that what we always say and it holds true today, the higher end of our book is on negotiated pricing and they provide a lot more to us than just commission for trade, they've large cash balances with us, they have large margin receivable with us.","So it was some pretty heavy sweating for our customer service reps and for our FCs on the ground working with customers. And our pricing changes I think resolved a lot of that, bringing it down to 675, because our offering overall provides a significant amount of value to our customers. That was true before the price cuts and it remains true after the price cuts. What they gave us the opportunity to do in the price cuts is really pull forward, what we were thinking about and looking at internally for post integration on the options outside. And also allowed us to redefine, we\u2019ll be look at as an active account and looking at 30 trades per quarter as oppose to the 150 that we used to use. Which we believe is the right customer and the right type to go after with our improved options capabilities and derivatives trading capabilities, our service client, services team that we put in place on the active trader side, our derivative services guide.","So we think, we\u2019re in the right place now. In terms of positioning the franchise for additional costs at the instance and take a step back. When I look at what when on and Mike hit it head on in his prepared remarks, in 2010 we went through this and we saw this price cut and matching and we collapsed in tears and there is really no reallocation among the larger players. There was a lot of lower pricing, a lot of revenue foregone and a lot of shareholder value that went out the door. But we didn\u2019t really see a lot of reallocation among.","So in my view, I don\u2019t really want to see additional price cuts come through, but Mike is right, we\u2019ll do everything we can to defend the franchise and in terms of, if we\u2019re have to go down lower, if we had to match, we\u2019ll have to do what we need to do to keep our customers on our book, it's the most valuable asset we have. So it\u2019s really move of the same should that happen, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s rational to think about additional price costs at this point in time, particularly given what we\u2019re seeing in the early days, but we\u2019ll see how it ends up and it\u2019s not always necessarily within our control, but we\u2019ll absolutely defend our franchise.","Steven Chubak","Thanks Karl. Certainly very helpful detail. And just switching over to the deposit growth side of the equation. The balance sheet growth itself is actually coming stronger than expected. You guys touched on some of the factors driving that faster growth. What do you believe is a reasonable pace of organic deposit growth that you can achieve, once the on boarding is completed? And what do you believe is that reasonable expectation in terms of deposit beta? Has your thinking there evolved a but given some increased competition we have already seen from one of your competitor actually passing on some of the benefits to clients this early on in terms of the rate tightening cycle?","Karl Roessner","I'll start with that I mean we did see pretty good growth in the quarter. If you measure it in terms of what we sort of size of the fully deployed balance sheet, last quarter we were at 62.5 this quarter we are showing at 65 from the pace of balance sheet growth, I think it disappointed, the pacing will be really in line with capital generation as we go forward. As we really deploy the buffer that we had at the start of the year. From an organic growth perspective I think you can expect deposit growth or cash growth really to stale with underlying account growth, asset growth that's within the business. And so from a cash perspective, we would expect cash to grow in line with accounts and assets, once we reach sort of that fully deployed stage. So you can mirror that directly to the underlying business forecast. With the only really caveat is that our corporate services business does generate some cash and that is a little bit more heavier around the seasonal vesting patterns that are in that business.","Steven Chubak","Then just one more in terms of efficiency targets that you guys have outlined. Then as you think about the long term profitability of your business just given your heavier gearing to on NII or spread revenue relative to some of your peers its about 60% of your revenue less than 50% with the peers stat. Now there is a case to be made that the operating margins that your moral supports should in fact be greater than that 46% that you've outlined in the earnings log slide. And in the environment where commission cuts aren\u2019t accelerating and we continue to see some health growth in terms of balance sheet and some additional rate help, what do you believe is at least an achievable margin target longer term and is it reasonable to expect that it could, in fact grow beyond 46%?","Karl Roessner","So I'll start with [indiscernible] and then I'll hand over to Mike for some specific guidance, but I couldn't agree with you more, this business can absolutely generate higher margins, and we can absolutely get there, but I think what you described would be the perfect utopian state, where there is no additional pricing pressure, maybe there is no additional competition coming in for our account. Because remember before in that type of environment our competitors are benefiting just as much as we are. And it's probably extremely difficult out there to maintain and defend your book so you have to look at continuing to defend and continuing to invest in the best technology you can provide to your customers, you need to look at marketing how do we make sure that we keep out there and keep in the customer mindset and attract our fresher of new customers that come into the pipeline.","And what else do we need to do to continue to maintain, defend and then grow our book. So that\u2019s why when you start getting out there you can come up with some pretty big numbers based on the current scheme we have if you don\u2019t -- if you hold everything constant sure we can do better. Mike why don\u2019t you?","Michael Pizzi","Sure we put out really a long term target with 100 basis point normalization and achieving of our growth goals of about 46%. But if you do the math on what we are putting that\u2019s going to give you a pretty high operating margin on both our additional growth as well as the additional moves in rates. And obviously it extends the rate move where you accelerate the growth even further and keep applying that you will get higher and higher out margins.","When we look at a model and we do that math we have to use an element of judgment as to how much we think the competitive environment is going to intensify, and how much of the -- are we going to be able to pass through of the rate hikes. So for today, we think sort of that mid 40s, 46% as we\u2019re showing our long-term earnings slide is the appropriate target for how we\u2019re thinking about the business today. But the competitive environment warrants it, there is no reason why, those operating margins could not be higher.","Steven Chubak","Very helpful color guys and congratulates on strong quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Conor Fitzgerald with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Conor Fitzgerald ","Karl, I want to get your latest thoughts about the targets 200 to 300 basis points in fast organic growth and just how that feeds in the firm's strategy. The pricing cuts we saw this quarter highlight that the pick-up in organic growth improving can be pretty quickly overwhelmed by pricing pressure. Just given what you saw in 1Q, is it still your view that executing in your growth target is still in the best interest to shareholders, even with maybe more elevated risk of future pricing cuts?","Karl Roessner","Yes. I absolutely stand by the growth goals we put out and they are absolutely achievable within the timeframes that we've set forth. I've gone through this Mike a number of times in terms of where we are in the interest rate front, where we are on the balance sheet and where we are just as a franchise. I really like what I\u2019m seeing around here, I like the initiatives that we have taken and I like the way we\u2019ve gone through and restructured the company around the goals that we've set. So we had real ownership and real accountability throughout the organization to deliver on this and teams that really stepped up. So I\u2019m excited about it and absolutely no change in timeframe and scope to the goals or what we promise to deliver.","Conor Fitzgerald ","And maybe building on that from a broader strategy perspective. You\u2019re still confident that the improving growth is kind of in the best interest of shareholders. If you just think about it as a risk reward equation of faster growth versus maybe the risk of intense pressure. It's still your view that the reward of faster growth is the best half for shareholders?","Karl Roessner","It is absolutely they might be a color, it\u2019s absolute a lot of thing.","Michael Pizzi","Conor, when we look at sort of the revenue drivers in terms of how we general P&L from a net interest perspective, from a commission perspective, from fees and service charges from our margin book and from our stock lending position. As we look at all this revenue drivers, commission is one element of it, where there is certainly sensitivity to commissions and certainly we\u2019ve seen what happen this quarter. You could see right in the quarterly results the power of all of the other drivers coming together. And then just look at how we illustrate the earnings power of that growth, it\u2019s pretty clear to us that growth remains the right objective for the firm.","Conor Fitzgerald ","Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. Just wanted to get the updated thoughts. And then Mike one for you, you mentioned, you\u2019re bumping up again the 7% Tier 1 leverage target. I interpreted your comments about operating what the buffer, about the 7% target as meaning you wouldn\u2019t drop below that number, even for a temporary period of time, but just wanted to confirm that? And then second do you have any appetite for additional prep issuances to help accelerate the balance sheet growth?","Michael Pizzi","The 7% is the floor, so we have no intention to drop below it. We are aware of where things are in the preferred market, but right now we think the best course of action is to continue to build out from an organic capital generation standpoint.","Conor Fitzgerald ","Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question. ","Rich Repetto","Yes good evening guys. I guess the first question is just maybe an obvious. But I don\u2019t know what happen on cash and cash equivalents. So it went down by 1 billion, is that, could you just explain that?","Michael Pizzi","It\u2019s the cash position at the bank Rich, if you look at the yield table, you\u2019ll see it\u2019s a little bit higher. It's just investing in securities really over the last few weeks and just positioning of the balance sheet in terms of what was settling and what was unsettled, you can see on average for the quarter it was higher, we continue to just sort of you know sweep cash over, it\u2019s the movements that are coming on and off the balance sheet as we deploy them, it\u2019s the record date really versus just the ongoing average.","Rich Repetto","Got it, okay, and then the next question is you know a peer, you know their average commission dropped -- will drop, they gave guidance or by around the low double digit percentage. If you take your 8-10 it\u2019s going to be over, and you said it could even be less than 8-10 in the coming quarters, it's going to be more like in the low 20% compared to 4Q's average commission. So I'm just trying to understand you know what do you think the impact is it, they're doing more price discounting than you do, is it derivatives or is it the idea that you bought you know the act of [indiscernible] why is it that big a difference versus your peer, the drop in commission?","Karl Roessner","I think one rates we did bring the active traders here down, that's a lower price point than I think the peer you're referring to. In terms of where we are, that's a significant portion of our book, but then keep in mind we have a book of business we bought at OptionsHouse is already pricing Tier, so it's really not affected by that move in any way. So I mean it's just a dynamic, every book of business has evolved differently through past acquisitions, grandfathered acquisition rates through negotiated schedules that have been applied over time in terms of what the decision we made in terms of how we're going to offer pricing in the market versus theirs.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Devon Ryan with JMP Securities, please proceed with your question.","Devon Ryan","Would love to maybe just drill down a little bit more into the drivers of the strength in that negative quarter, maybe just set it a little more granular level if you can, how much is from the active traders sales efforts versus how much you think is coming from marketing, branding, or if you're going to attribute anything specifically to OptionsHouse momentum, and then just in your opinion how much do you feel like is really truly a direct result of the things that you're doing versus how much is seasonality as you mentioned or the Trump-bump, just looking to see if we could get a little more granular there.","Karl Roessner","Sure, so it\u2019s -- when I look at how we proceeded and what we've done over the past couple of months. There is quite a bit of more directed marketing and more thoughtful marketing going in to our campaign, so a lot more on the digital side and we're being a little different in the way that we approach things around here, so there's a little bit of marketing. It has to do with some of the active trader sales and as I said in the prepared remarks we're not declaring victory and there was absolutely some of the environment behind some of the strength in our result.","We're just getting started, right. So the first quarter to me, is extremely encouraging in terms of what we are able to produce. We haven't rolled out our new brand campaign, we haven't put ourselves back on the map in terms of the irreverent challenger brand that we are. We haven't got through a fully integrated OptionsHouse and rolled out some of the top derivatives capabilities into our entire E-trade book. So the first quarter results are extremely encouraging given what we've been able to roll out to date and where we're headed.","Devon Ryan","Yes, absolutely, great result there, and then just maybe a follow up on some of the prior questions on some of the thinking after the price cuts, I mean obviously, one way to defend is to match on pricing, and another way is to add more value for clients over shift and mix of your business. So I am just curious after that are there any specific investments that have maybe been moved to the front burner for the firm or changes just within the priority list, as I'm sure you know that this cut wasn\u2019t in the budget to start of the year and it doesn\u2019t seem like obviously, the aggregate expense commentary is all that different, but just curious kind of mix of how you are thinking about spending and opportunities might be shifting a little bit?","Michael Pizzi","Look when we set out our plans for the year and we worked on the budget and really those the corresponding strategic and capital plan we identified initiatives that really tie in very closely to the growth goals. Obviously, getting to $6 billion in managed assets or fee based assets as we would say managed products is an important goal, the derivate amounts are an important goal. Those projects remain high priorities of the company. And so really we don\u2019t feel that we needed to really reprioritize much, overall from the project standpoint. On the expense side yes, the environment forces us to be disciplined, but that\u2019s a culture that we are trying to instill and put in place every day, is to remain disciplined and focused in how we look at expenses.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Harris","Clearly the commission cuts show the vulnerability of that revenue source. Can you guys give us an update about your longer-term plans to diversify the business away from that? And then how quickly do you think you can do that?","Karl Roessner","When I look at the way we are set up now, we have our stock plan business on one side and we've just acquired to finish the acquisition on the auctions outside. So it's really growing the derivatives traders and growing the percentage of our customers that exercise those trades and use the functionality in the tools that we have taken in. That\u2019s one pieces, it's moving upstream in that. It will help us bringing the higher end of the book and help us bring in more value-added customers.","So it's not about reaching out and trying to find additional streams of revenue. We would like to be able to rollout additional managed product that\u2019s one of the goals and one of the sets of people we have focused on moving up to $6 billion to make sure that we can provide the best possible global capabilities and best possible managed investment products to roll the amount to our customers and its more investment on that side. So that\u2019s really part of our organic growth strategy Chris and those are right in line with goals that we've set out before any of these price cuts took place.","Chris Harris","And then just unrelated question on branding. You guys had mentioned that you are really focused on that, and really I am just kind of wondering how do you guys want E*TRADE to be viewed by the market place perhaps -- versus perhaps how you being viewed today?","Karl Roessner","So what I would like to do when I believe what our new marketing agency MullenLowe and the fantastic marketing people we have here will be able to put out, is a campaign that puts us back on the map, in terms of the irreverent challenger brand that we are. And we will rollout additional branding and advertising around products and capabilities sets following the completion of the integration on the options outside. So it's really getting back to the roots that we came from an irreverent challenger brand with fantastic tools products and services to be offered to our customers looking particularly on the active trader side and on the derivatives and options capabilities.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen with Buckingham. You may proceed with your question.","Chris Allen","Just wanted to touch a little bit on the NIM guidance. So I\u2019m just kind of reconcile that with the guidance you gave after fourth quarter, which for [indiscernible] from the full year was 250 to 255, was 10 basis points higher with the June hike, you got a hike sooner than expected, you were able to put on a lot of assets into security pretty decent, it looks like. So I\u2019m just wondering why there wouldn\u2019t be a little bit more upside relative to that guidance that you\u2019re currently providing?","Michael Pizzi","Yes. Chris, we said 255, we said a June hike would be -- mid-June hike would be work about 10 basis points. We\u2019ve got that hike looking at sort of what that hike did is it flattened the curve a little bit, spreads a little bit tighter overall. So while we\u2019re still optimistic below 260 is really sort of midpoint to midpoint, we\u2019re getting to almost the same place to getting that 10. But we didn\u2019t see that 25 basis points yield and we're completely across the curve, with spreads out cognitive. So we had to back it a little bit off of a level. But we still think that there is pretty strong NIM expansion with each within hike.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Cyprys","You spoke a lot about the active trader customer. Just curious how you\u2019re prioritizing growing from longer term retirement last year. And what\u2019s the opportunity set to see that more aggressively here and how you see that business, aspect of your business could look at, say five years?","Michael Pizzi","Sure. I mean look growing the active trader is really about reclaim the roots of our business. In terms of the evolution of the company, as a brand and where we are today and really, really closing gap that emerged in the past few years in that market, that you can see is very much tied in with the OptionsHouse acquisition. But right along with that are initiatives to improve in the mange investment products space and to continue to try and be one of the best providers at offering digitally centric financial services and that goes directly into the retirement space.","We\u2019ve been doing pretty well in growing retirement assets even though we were a bit late to get started. But as you can see, we are really at the beginning of a revolution in the digital distribution and financial services. And so it's a key priority for us over the next few years, especially the lower asset size customer were in digital distribution is going probably be the main stay of the market.","Michael Cyprys ","And you mentioned buyback in terms of not also margin targets generally taking longer term. Where you can operate, I guess why not just kind of put that aside adjust invest more aggressively going after the retirement in past set there. How do you skip kind of balancing the margin capital management versus investing more aggressively into the sales?","Karl Roessner","Well, when we layout or playing, you look at sort of what the capacity is sort of product development from an advertising standpoint from positioning. We think this is right plan that allows us to deliver and keep in those objectives while delivery and also those results to the bottom-line. I mean certainly, if there is more to investment opportunity and the value is there. We certainly have that option. But how we sort of think about that balance is really sort of the value of the investments we're making and the value of the next marginal investment versus letting it go, letting the additional earnings flow through to the bottom and become part of capital.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James, please proceed with your question.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","Question for you on deposit beta. So prior to essential crisis, was the rate paid on customer brokerage ever used as a competitive lever, and if not, why is it the general assumption that the deposit beta on those assets is not something close to zero.","Karl Roessner","We've always taken the position that the deposit beta is a fairly low number, as you've heard me say many times the best evidence of that is when LIBOR rates were around 5% we were paying about 1% on sweep and growing the underlying sweep balance. If you want to go back that far in time. When we look at what customers are most sensitive to, obviously, they're sensitive to commission level, they're sensitive to margin rate, they're sensitive to a lot of things, but really the bottom of that list is really sort of the cash level overall in terms of these being relatively small transaction accounts. That may differ across the industry depending on the size of the account and the amount of cash, but when you look on average for our average account size as an average cash holding the betas are pretty low as you're suggesting and therefore it's not necessarily the most efficient place from a competitive differentiation. That said, there are customers who care deeply and you have to have the right product mix to address that need.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","Got it, thanks and then follow up question, so we obviously saw very strong net new asset and account growth that you trade in, to be honest we saw a strong account and asset growth at your publicly traded competitors as well, so if your strong growth wasn't coming from mortgage or gains and same thing for your competitors, can you maybe provide us some color on where you think that was coming from, was it from the full service channel, was it from your existing customers, at least the net new assets. What was really driving those flows and the new account that you saw during the quarter.","Michael Pizzi","I don't have the information on that front coming on or where they came from, but a lot of work going into what we're doing on the marketing side, what we're doing on the product side and what we're doing to move forward you know to continue to grow account. So I can't speak to our competitors, I can't speak to exactly where our accounts came from on the call.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brendon Hawking with UBS, please proceed with your question.","Brendon Hawking","So one, you made a reference earlier to the new pricing tier that you guys have rolled out. I know it's only been a few weeks, but curious whether or not you're actually noting any adjustments in client behavior with this new lowered tier and you know obviously adjusting for any calendar issues such as option expiration and the like, are you seeing some of your clients actually try to reach for this aspirational level, like you designed it?","Karl Roessner","It's early days in terms of what we rolled out and I think we'll start to see some more of this and we'll have some better data, when we get through the integration on the OptionsHouse and we start offering their tools into the completely trade population. It's a little bit early to make a judgment call on that one given where the pricing changes took place in the quarter.","Brendon Hawking","Alright, maybe I'll give it a shot next quarter, and then apologies if you walked through this when you were running through the NIM outlook, Mike, but on the recent hike with March did you guys change your margin rates and was there any difference in the adjustment in margin depending on negotiated rate versus rack?","Michael Pizzi","We did change our rates that included both negotiated and rack rates, and so the book essentially reset. There is still an ongoing movement of growth in negotiated versus rack. So that does cause a little bit deterioration that you can see on the period versus the full sort of 25 basis points that you would see coming out that December hike. But we move all accounts.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Carrier","Just a question on capital allocation. You mentioned the balance sheet and I guess once you are to this steady state and then you are growing organically from inflows. Just wanted to get your sense, when you think about that versus the buybacks, is there a certain rate environment, one that makes the buyback option a bit more attractive as you get into the second half?","Karl Roessner","Right now when you look at sort of the differential between the on-balance sheet, off balance sheet rates, it still makes sense to continue to pursue the strategy of balance sheet growth. But I think more importantly in that is if we tried to place the large quantum of deposits that we have off balance sheet we would actually see some dilution in the rate as we would move through -- we would move from more aggressive to less aggressive banks in terms of what they would be willing pay to take those deposits overall in our sweep waterfall [ph] program. So from a balance standpoint, this remains the best use of capital and strategy. Sure we can come up with yield curve environment where that may not be the case and we're going adjust accordingly to do the right things for shareholders and get the best return on capital possible.","Michael Carrier","And then just quick follow up on the themes or services lines, just wanted to get a sense when you are basically done with the strategy on the off-balance sheet cash, is there a base level for that revenue line? I know there is a lot of other items in there, so maybe that's tough, but just wanted to get a sense.","Karl Roessner","Yes it is literally fees and service charges, so there is a lot of things that are in there other than just the off-balance sheet revenue that\u2019s running through there. So you have any fee that customer might pay, other service charges, wire fees all things like that and then including payment for order flow. So overall we haven\u2019t broken it out in terms of what percentage of it is from each area but we can probably think about giving a little bit more color on that as that goes down and is replaced by net interest income. I think you can get all that data in the Q.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Kyle Voigt","Most of my questions have been answered, but I guess a few housekeeping questions. Mike, sorry if I missed this, but did you say the average reinvestment rates in Q1 or 230 to 250 basis points, can you give us an update on the current reinvestment rates, are you still in that range?","Michael Pizzi","We are still in that range. We have been moving about, spreads have been getting a little bit tighter, rate came down, but we're seeing rates moved back up a little bit. We are still in the 230 to 250 basis points range now.","Kyle Voigt","And then Karl, just a follow up on the question earlier. I think you said there is bit of spike in the renegotiations and call volumes with those active traders right after the cut by one of your last competitors, before you made your cut. Can you give us a sense of what you are seeing today in terms of renegotiation versus what you were seeing prior to the cuts in the beginning of February, just trying to get a sense if it's more intense now still?","Karl Roessner","No. For the top end of the book, there is always competition. People are always trying to go after those folks with large balances, large margin balances and active traders in that front. So we see that kind of competition the call volume has decided we'd back down to sort of normal levels, if you will. But there is a lot of competition out in the marketplace and a lot of offers, unlike things that we\u2019ve seen in the past, we continue to do what we\u2019re doing to make sure we keep our customers and defend the book. But this call volume is definitely down from where we stared pre-our move .","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed with your question.","Brian Bedell ","Just a little bit more in the time color, you were talking about obviously the rollout of the market and campaign in that and the branding along with technology enhancements with OptionsHouse, I think you were saying we're going to close that in the third quarter? Is that possible to be a little bit more precise about the exact timing of the close and then as for the rollout, I would think that would be in the fall?","Karl Roessner","So in terms of what we\u2019re looking at, first of all, in the marketing campaign, we hope to by the end of June, beginning of July rollout our new marketing campaign. So that will be focused primarily around our rebranding and sort of some hard-hitting advertising we'll go out with. The integration itself is still planned for the third quarter, mid to end third quarter, and I guess sort of a safe assumption on where we are. And in connection with that you\u2019ll see some additional advertising, some additional product rolls that will come out afterwards.","But the integration for us is the start of everything that we\u2019re doing. So innovating and bringing the OH platforms that we acquired to the next level, something we're already working on and hope to rollout following integration. So I think you\u2019ll see a lot more from us overtime, I'm pretty excited about what the future looks like. So I would just, if you would, just say June and we'll be there as soon as we can.","Brian Bedell ","It sounds like there could be a little bit of soft patch in the organic growth in the spring depending I guess on the environment and then obviously you would expect that to reaccelerate upon all this -- working through these clients. Maybe just one last one on the commission rate, $8.10, any sense of what that would be pro forma for the seasonality, I think you mentioned the corporate stock plan, trades were affecting that rate. So for certain [Multiple Speakers].","Karl Roessner","Yes. If you go back and look you'll to see our Q1 is always strong due to corporate services. If you think around, right around $8 is going to be really -- is a good run rate going forward.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Vincent Hung with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Hung","I just want to switch upon again on the strength of [indiscernible] growth. Is there any sense of the mix between the number of accounts you\u2019re gaining from competitors versus customers versus accounts, never had brokerage accounts before, and how that compares historically?","Karl Roessner","I mean, we get accounts from lots of different places and we\u2019ve done a lot to revamp the way that we go after accounts and in particular some of the reach out and call out campaigns we\u2019ve had around our new active trader sales group and some of the other activities that have been taking place, and it\u2019s not a breakdown that I have in front of me, but our accounts come from lots of different place and we're just happy with the growth we had in the quarter and we expect to see more.","Vincent Hung","Okay. And you noted that you\u2019re going to be addressing the main customer endpoint. Can you touch upon what these are?","Karl Roessner","The way we look at it, the pain points and the list of dissatisfiers, if you will, changes on pretty much at daily basis. So there are always five or six things that our call reps are getting calls from customers on and it\u2019s really trying to identify those before they hit that level and before they become a pain point for customers. So a minute you see that somebody in the call center needs to do a work around or deal with an issue on a repeated basis, you step in and fix it you raise your hand. So it\u2019s really about changing culture and changing the way we think and the way that we act in the call centers with our reps.","If you see something, you raise your hand, you tell someone, it goes on the list and you knock it out. It\u2019s a change in focus is really what\u2019s driving that and I\u2019m not going to aim for the specific list of dissatisfies, because it\u2019s constantly changing and we\u2019re doing everything we can to make sure our customers have the best experience possible and they never have the reason to leave E*TRADE.","Operator","And with that, I will now turn the call over to you Mr. Roessner for any concluding remarks.","Karl Roessner","Well, thank you all for joining and have a nice evening.

With respect to capital return, we repurchased 222 million of our stock in the quarter, announced a new $1.5 billion authorization and began tactically shifting our balance sheet to free capital, which allows us to opportunistically repurchase additional stock at an extremely compelling value.","Finally, we are reaffirming our long term EPS target of greater than $7 per share by 2023, as increased share repurchases and disciplined expense management help offset the interest rate pressures that have emerged in the last couple of quarters. This past quarter continued to see pronounced market volatility, a common theme since the fall of last year. Concerns around international trade and global growth drove major indexes near correction territory in May, before market surged to fresh highs in June.","Interest rates were front and center, as expectations from multiple Fed cuts mounted throughout the quarter. Throughout this period, our customers remained extremely engaged as both equity and derivative trades were at their highest volume for any Q2 on record. While the move in interest rates makes for a more challenging revenue environment, we continue to operate with the central tenant of creating the best possible experience for our customers. And in the second quarter, we made advancements across our suite of offerings.","We launched a new retirement planning hub that helps investors understand their financial picture and what gaps they may need to fill. We improved our automatic investing experience with a cleaner look and feel, while lowering minimum contributions to a bite size $25 and we dropped the minimums for our robo-advisor and pre-built mutual fund portfolios to $500. In short, we are breaking down barriers wherever we can on these already easy to use digital experiences, so investors can engage with the markets regardless of experience level or wealth.","On power E*TRADE, our award winning active trading platform, we introduced new features like intraday technical pattern recognition and predefined watch lists to assist traders with idea generation. We also recently rolled out paper trading, giving customers the ability to test drive the platform and their trade ideas without committing capital. As the intimidation factor is a persistent barrier to customer engagement with our more sophisticated tools, paper trading along with our other educational offerings serve as springboards to help our customers clear this hurdle.","Moving to the institutional side of the house, in May, we held our annual directions conference, which is the longest running equity compensation conference in the industry. We hosted around 650 participants, including a significant population of prospective clients. This conference is a fan favorite of our clients where they can work closely with our team to learn about and test new enhancements, deliver feedback, and share insights with peers. Some enhancements that particularly resonate with clients include seamless integration of client systems via APIs, financial reporting enhancements, and our automated 10b5-1 solution. ","As for E*TRADE Advisor Services and our referral program, we continue to see great promise in this channel and are more than encouraged by the early interest from advisors and financial consultants alike. With that said, getting the integration of the custody platform right is of the utmost importance. And so while we have formalized the process and controls for FCs to link customers with advisors, we are still working through the middle and back office build out to seamlessly handle the flows and activity. This has taken longer than initially anticipated, but we expect the integration to be complete in the first half of next year. We've also recently realigned management in this group, bringing on several industry veterans. ","Now for our operating results. DARTs of 268,000 were up 7% from the year ago quarter, but down 4% sequentially from the strong Q1. Derivative DARTs of 89,000 were up 4% versus the year ago quarter and represented 33% of total trades. The [indiscernible] mentality was on full display as our retail customers were intense net buyers from early May through early June when the Dow and S&P pulled back 7% and the NASDAQ hit correction [ph] territory, down more than 10% before meaningful profit took hold in June, resulting in a very modest net buy position for the quarter. ","July DARTs to date have moderated slightly, currently down 2% from June. We generated net new retail and advisor services accounts of 34,000, down from last quarter\u2019s record. Net inflows at 1.6 billion reflected higher than usual pressures from tax seasons. Corporate Services remains a white hot bright spot. We generated 36,000 net new accounts or an 8% annualized growth rate. Gross inflows were a remarkable 25 billion with new implementations of 9 billion, our second best quarter ever. This brings our total implementations to 23 billion over the last 12 months.","We grew total assets within Corporate Services channel to 259 billion, up 1% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. On the capital front, as of the end of the second quarter, we had completed more than 800 million of our current $1 billion buyback authorization and we plan to continue our robust pace of capital return, which is particularly accretive to EPS at the current stock price. By leveraging our third party sweep deposit arrangement and shifting deposits off balance sheet, we can continue to grow our franchise and retain future earnings power from deposit growth, while directing capital to share repurchases today at extremely attractive valuations. ","We will take a fluid approach to the allocation of capital based on the prevailing economic environment and the value of our shares. Before turning the call over to Mike and Chad, I want to spend a moment on our philosophy toward expense management and op margin. We continue to evaluate expenses through the same lens we use to look at all of our capital investment decisions. This means we will respond to the revenue landscape, directing investments in the manner that best serves franchise growth in consideration of long term earnings power and shareholder value creation.","We have a tremendously efficient and scalable business that allows for operating margin improvement as we grow the revenue base. By shifting our deposits off balance sheet to third parties, we are sacrificing some revenue growth in the short term, while increasing shareholder returns via share buybacks. But in doing so, we are prioritizing EPS growth and capital return over op margin. Given our tremendous cash generation power, the most efficient way to grow EPS in the current environment is by combining our operating leverage and financial leverage, where we pair business growth with extremely robust share repurchases.","To summarize, we are very pleased with the core results of the quarter and enhancements we continue to make for our customers and the flexibility to position E*TRADE for success, no matter the environment. ","With that, I will turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, Mike Pizzi.","Michael Pizzi","Thanks, Karl. I would like to briefly address our tactical shift to managing our balance sheet and capital. In previous quarters, we\u2019ve spoken about the flexibility afforded by our sweep program to move deposits to third party banks in a manner seamless to our customers. This program expands FDIC insurance protection for our customers and gives us added capital capacity for deposits not held on our balance sheet. We are also in the process of developing the ability to treat bank deposits in a similar fashion.","Over the last year and a half, this off balance sheet program held 3 billion to 4 billion in balances, earning a gross yield modestly above the federal fund\u2019s effective rate. Since the beginning of the year, interest rates have declined by 50 to 75 basis points. The yield curve has flattened and even inverted at some points and the spread that we can earn on balance sheet versus the fees we earn off balance sheet has compressed. ","By directing deposits off balance sheet, we can free capital for share repurchases, which would otherwise be required to support customer deposits on balance sheet. Given the flattening curve, we shifted 6.6 billion of deposits to third party banks throughout the quarter, 4.5 billion of which related to our sales of lower yielding securities. If the current environment persists, we plan to direct new deposits off balance sheet and can further shift existing deposits off balance sheet as our investment portfolio turns over.","As a reminder, we operate the bank at an internal capital threshold of 7%, which means for every 1 billion of bank deposit shifted off balance sheet, we can free an additional 70 million worth of capital. Our business model generates very healthy excess capital at 80 to 90% of earnings when we are growing the balance sheet. By diverting deposits off balance sheet, we anticipate that our capital generation will be well in excess of earnings, allowing us to amplify buybacks at a point when it is highly accretive to EPS.","This is currently the most compelling path given the flatness of the yield curve and the low valuation of our stock and will remain the case, even if short term rates decrease. Similarly, this approach is accretive to ROE as new business growth comes free of capital commitment. Ultimately, we believe that EPS and ROE are the most important drivers of the stock and we will take every appropriate action to maximize both measures through continued business growth and prudent capital actions.","The tactical shift along with continued franchise growth and expense discipline keeps us on pace to generate greater than $7 of EPS by 2023, even with the recent decline in rates. Our plan builds in two Fed cuts by the end of this year and keeps Fed Funds flat at 2% through the end of 2023. Importantly, we retain the flexibility to shift our approach if the environment changes, and should the yield curve steepen, we can seamlessly shift deposit growth on balance sheet when it is most economic.","Now, I will turn the call over to Chad for a rundown of the quarter.","Chad Turner","Thanks, Mike. For the quarter, we reported net income available to common shareholders of 219 million or $0.90 per diluted share on net revenues of 685 million. Included in the quarter was an 80 million pre-tax loss on securities, or $0.24 per share impact related to the sale of 4.5 billion of lower yielding investment securities in order to reduce our balance sheet and free capital. Offsetting this loss was an 8 million pre-tax or $0.02 per share benefit to provision for loan losses.","As for core results, net interest income decreased by 2 million sequentially as our net interest margin contracted by three basis points to 320 basis points and our average interest earning assets grew by approximately 350 million. Our NIM decline was driven by a 4 basis point greater cost of funds offset by a 1 basis point expansion in gross yield. Our blended deposit rate rose from 32 basis points to 36 basis points, driven primarily by growth in premium savings account balances. This rate includes both on and off balance sheet sweep deposits, bank deposits, and brokerage customer payables. ","For Q3, we expect the blended deposit rates to be relatively flat to Q2. Our average reinvestment rate in the securities portfolio is currently 270 to 290 basis points. For the full year, we still anticipate generating a NIM of 315 to 320 basis points, consistent with our expectations we communicated last quarter. This guidance holds customer margin balances at their current levels, assumes deposits grow off balance sheet and contemplates one Fed fund\u2019s rate cut in July and one cut in September. ","A 25 basis point move up or down in short term rates beyond the cuts we have included in our NIM guidance would translate to a 3 basis point annualized impact to NIM. Commission revenue of 121 million was down 1 million compared to last quarter, driven by 11,000 lower DARTs and a $0.03 lower CPT, offset by the benefit of two additional trading days. We continue to expect CPT to fall in the 690 to 730 [ph] range for the full year. Fees and service charges of 126 million were up 16 million year-over-year and up 8 million sequentially, as we benefited from more deposits off balance sheet, a more profitable customer trade mix, and a handful of other seasonal factors.","The average net yield on third party cash was flat quarter-over-quarter, with third party money market fees of 53 basis points and third party sweep deposit fees of 221 basis points, both net of deposit costs. In Q3, we anticipate that gross fees on off balance sheet sweep deposits will be around 240 basis points with net fees of approximately 210 basis points. We reported a net loss on sale of securities of 64 million, driven primarily by the 80 million of losses on security sales. We expect to realize approximately 10 million of gains per quarter going forward.","Moving to expenses, non-interest expenses were 398 million, compensation and benefits of 168 million was up sequentially, driven by 7 million of severance in the quarter related to the realignment of select teams. Marketing expense of 48 million was down 6 million from Q1. This quarter\u2019s adjusted operating margin, which excludes provision benefit, was 42%. The 80 million of losses on security sales negatively affected the adjusted operating margin by approximately 6 percentage points. For the full year, we anticipate generating an adjusted operating margin of 46%. This includes a 1 percentage point net negative impact from the discrete items that we have communicated for the past two quarters, namely the 80 million loss on security sales this quarter, offset by the 14 million benefit on the communications line reported in Q1.","Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 26%. We expect the full year 2019 rate to be between 26% and 27%. We finished the quarter at 380 million of corporate cash, reflecting 250 million in subsidiary dividends, less the 222 million we used to repurchase our stock and the 34 million paid in common dividends. As a reminder, we target holding a minimum of 300 million in corporate cash. We have 157 million remaining on our current buyback authorization and an additional 1.5 billion on our new authorization, which we plan to complete by the end of Q3 2020.","In closing, Q2 results were robust, our position with customers is strong and the prospect for growth in our retail and institutional channels remains very positive. While the interest rate environment clearly presents challenges, we have both the financial and operating flexibility to navigate through this environment and continue to deliver compelling value for our shareholders.","With that, we will turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Rich Repetto","So just a follow up question on the sale of security. So, on this 4.5 billion sale, Mike, I'm just trying to understand how you, on the loss, when rates were down in the quarter and when you say you can continue to do this going forward, can you walk us through sort of the -- how much more of an opportunity you have on the security side? And the accretion you say is accretive, could you walk us through sort of the math behind the accretive remarks that you've put around this?","Michael Pizzi","Well, sure, Rich. Here, the securities we sold were lower yielding securities that were on our balance sheet that come from yield curve environments in the past that were much lower. So, you could think of them as investments that we made quite some time ago that we've been holding, they've been paying down a bit, but we still had quite a number of lower yielding securities on the book. When we look at that securities yield versus the sort of capital that we're holding, looking relative to the loss that we took, it became really quite clear that selling these to \u2013 selling the lower yielding securities to accelerate an amount of capital return is clearly sort of in the best interest of shareholders, if we look at it from an overall EPS and ROE perspective.","In terms of kind of further opportunity, there are still some securities in the book that are still relatively lower yields, but they will be a population higher than this population that we sold.","Rich Repetto","Okay, we can just discuss it more. I guess the follow up question would be, Karl, so there's been these media reports about a potential wealth management transaction in the space, I know that's been an area of focus. And I guess, could you review your guidelines on how you look at M&A and your appetite for wealth management capabilities and what metrics you\u2019d use to sort of evaluate a deal?","Karl Roessner","Yeah, sure, Rich. I mean, we've been pretty clear on our position about M&A. First of all, we've run it through the same capital lens that we've talked about and looking at sort of the risk free return as the bar or the hurdle we'd have to get to. So, not an easy hurdle to overcome in the current environment with our stock price where it is, particularly given the actions that we've just taken, but looking for us, it's focusing on scale, it's focusing on any opportunities that we might have around our stellar corporate services business, also around, the services or other items that we provide out for the RIA custody population and to looking at sort of add-ons or bolt-ons, if you will, nothing that I would currently comment on or go through, but our appetite has not changed and the focus hasn't changed. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","On the buyback, just curious about how we should think about it. I appreciate the comment around the timing. But is there a way we should think about this as far as stock prices and multiple impacting velocity? Or is the pace of the buyback going to be pretty steady in a program type approach?","Karl Roessner","I think you'll see sort of the way that we've approached it in the past will be the way that we approach it going forward, will be done at a relatively measured pace over the next sort of 12 month period is what the authorization is for. Obviously, where there are opportunities for us to do a little more, a little less, that's what we do. We have some good advisors, and we do put the appropriate plans in place to take care of that.","Brennan Hawken","And then on the long term earnings target, it's kind of hard to notice with precision, because, but sort of eyeballing it here, when I look at the revenue growth component, we have that subset underneath, it looks like balance sheet growth as a contributor to revenue growth here didn't change much from your prior expectations. And so curious about how that squares with this plan to shift the deposits to the third party banks, and how it squares with your assumptions around the NIM guidance where I believe you said that all of the deposit growth would be off balance sheet in that assumption, do you guys then just sunset that after the year and then assume that it returns to balance sheet growth? How do those two different -- seemingly different inputs square?","Chad Turner","Yeah, so just starting \u2013 I\u2019ll actually start reverse order with your NIM question. So, the guidance we gave of 315 to 320, that was for this year. And I would really look at it as, given the environment we're in now, the relative value of our stock and the dynamics between off and on balance sheet, that that 1.5 billion authorization over the next 12 months is our current intent. When you look over the long term, which is what's on the greater than $7 slide, we believe there's value to having a balance sheet, and that over time, growing deposits on our balance sheet does provide the best source of value. That said, we would evaluate the environment at any given period over the five year horizon to make sure we're making that decision correctly. But I would note that on the long term earnings slide, with the multiples expanding, for example, in that illustration, you would be growing your balance sheet versus buying back stock over the entire horizon.","Karl Roessner","Once we get past this 1.5 billion, we\u2019d begin in a measured way in the outer years to grow the balance sheet again. Obviously, though, as indicated in my prepared remarks, we have the flexibility really to do what is right in the environment that we encounter at that time, and where we would take the action, therefore, accordingly as to whether we would continue with aggressive capital return or begin to move deposits back on balance sheet.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.","Steven Chubak","So, I want to start off with a question on the marginal margin of 70% to 75%, that's contemplated as part of the EPS walk. If I exclude the impact of the security sales this quarter, revenues were up about 5% year-on-year, expenses up 3.5 and that implies a marginal margin somewhere around 35%. And I\u2019m just wondering what are some of the factors driving some of the pressure on that incremental margin today and how do we start -- and what's going to prompt some improved momentum to get that building somewhere closer to the 70% to 75% from here.","Chad Turner","Yeah, the 70% to 75%, I would describe that as total revenue. And so depending on the type of revenue growth you're seeing, whether that's coming from cash, which is obviously at a much higher margin versus some of our other products or revenue streams, that could be a bit lower, that's going to have that ebb and flow in any given period. Obviously, we've been in an environment over the last -- over the trailing 12 months where cash growth has been low. We've had record net buying and so a lot more cash is being put to work in the market by our customers. So that's really where over the five year horizon of the long term earnings slide, you would expect to see that 70 to 75, as you're growing the balance sheet, acknowledging any given period could be a bit different depending on mix.","Steven Chubak","And just one more question from me on expense flexibility, the core net new asset growth did slow a little bit this quarter, just given some of the pressures in the more challenging operating backdrop, you talked about slowdown in engagement in July, how does it inform the approach to flexing expenses. And I know, Karl, you talked about your ability to maybe flex marketing spend, it\u2019s run rating at least in the first half a little bit above that 200 million, I'm wondering what we should expect if the weakness in activity persists that you're going to look to flex out maybe a little bit more aggressively from here.","Karl Roessner","So, look, it's a good question, Steven and it's something that we're obviously focused on as a management team and we talk about quite often. We do have the ability to flex marketing, even going into the end of the year, a lot of those contracts and things are canceled. But what we have seen and have had a lot of success with of late is the dollars within marketing that get not spent on the big ticket advertising or other pieces, but it's more around digital marketing, and more around the offers and sort of third party matches that we've been going through as we compete for additional business at the higher end of the book, right, and some of the offers that you're going out to your customers with. ","So all in all, we're quite pleased with where we are right now. And also on expense discipline, I would say just, we don't just focus on the marketing line in terms of throttling that, call it, 200 million up and back. There are a lot of levers that we have here with respect to expense discipline, and what we can pull back on. So when we look at projects that we invest in, what's going to drive revenue, how should we be prioritizing the things that we're doing within the firm, what are we doing with respect to headcount adds, can we do more with less? So there are a lot of decision points that go on into that line, Steven, and I can guarantee that this team is extremely focused on it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Autonomous Research.","Christian Bolu","I guess, I don't know if I missed this. But the operating margin target for 2020, are you still expecting 50%?","Chad Turner","No, we didn't give an update on that, Christian. This is Chad. As Karl had mentioned in his prepared remarks, moving to the off balance sheet dynamics, where you're giving up a bit of that yield difference between on and off to free up capital, that is going to allow you to pick EPS and ROE as the more important levers in this environment. And obviously, what we look at more long term, so operating margin would, the operating margin for 2020 would definitely be lower than that based on that decision.","Karl Roessner","Yes. And just to be clear, we have, absolutely with the moves that we've made and the flexibility in our model that\u2019s allowed us to make the moves that we have and just announced, we've clearly prioritized EPS growth and capital return over our op margins in the short term. But we are not coming off our longer term operating margin guidance, just because of the amount of leverage we can drive through this business and what we believe that we can get done. So over the longer term, we still absolutely anticipate it will be in excess of 50% on the op margin side.","Christian Bolu","If I guess follow up on that Karl, again, totally understand why you can hit 50% margin target for 2020. But, thinking back to obviously the October 18 growth targets as well, where there was a miss, how do you help convince investors that you can actually hit 2023 targets when the first signpost, the [indiscernible] has effectively been missed.","Chad Turner","Yeah, so I wouldn't, I don't phrase it as a miss. And I'm not necessarily worried about confidence in terms of what we're going to deliver. I think what we put on the table this evening shows that we've taken action in a time where we believe that this is the best return for our shareholders overtime, right. So we've taken the engine that we've talked about having a great degree of flexibility, that being our business model, and really put it to the test, right. We've gone to the off balance sheet route that we've had in the works for quite some time, it was able to move off with quite -- with ease, and be able to still hit the seven bucks that we've announced as EPS and we've looked at long term shareholder value over a short term op margin. So, expense discipline isn\u2019t something that we've shown and demonstrated over the past few years, we\u2019ll continue to do that. But we did give up some short term earnings and some short term revenue growth in order to do what we've done on the capital side. ","I don't know, Mike, if you want to add something to that.","Michael Pizzi","Yeah, look, I think what we're announcing here tonight is very significant in terms of the amount of capital return, especially when you look at that and on a cumulative basis to the existing billion dollar authorization, what that means from a relative value in terms of the multiple of the stock, we will \u2013 and sort of a permanent reduction in the share count against the earnings power really being in the firm, just shifting resources from a balance sheet side to the off balance sheet side. This goes a long way to driving us towards our goal. And I think you're going to see us continue to take the right set of actions to drive value creation over time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.","Devin Ryan","So just one on cash balances here, obviously good to see that move higher. And it sounds like some selling boosted cash at quarter end. I'm just curious what you're seeing on sorting behavior specifically right now, as you're evaluating what customers are doing kind of with the remaining cash in their accounts and whether you have any updated expectations on, that specifically on the sorting side?","Karl Roessner","Yeah, the one thing I would say, I'm going to pass it over to Chad for the specifics, Devin. But on the cash sorting side, we're still seeing our customers, I mean, remember the proportion of cash and the size of the cash that's in some of these accounts, in the accounts that we have in the sort of sub 10,000 range that sits in cash that's really investing cash. So we don't have a lot of the behaviors that you might see where they would go into money funds or money markets. We've obviously had quite a good product in the PSA that we've been able to roll out, but Chad I'll let you go through the specifics.","Chad Turner","Yeah, Devin, I think the simplest example to give you is, around just the fact that we have not seen any material impact in customers that are yield seeking on that front is that a fraction of 1% of our overall accounts have actually even purchased a money fund or a very short term ETF fund in their accounts. So it's just not something we see, to Karl's point, the majority of the cash from our customers is that frictional cash that's just coming in and out of the market. And so they remain relatively rate sensitive. They do not broadly look at cash as an asset class for them at E*TRADE in that sense. For those that do, they are able, the premium savings is an example of something that's been successful there, where we've been able to retain some of those customers that are looking for a bit more cash yield there.","Devin Ryan","And then just a follow up and we\u2019ve done some math here on the excess capital position. But on the buyback specifically, an incremental authorization, if you think about the sizing of that, do you guys have line of sight into that capital creation, purely from earnings and capital freed up from the recent security sales? Or is that kind of sized with a thought of additional security sales, or maybe even said a different way, if there are additional security sales over the next year or so, does that actually just create additional dry powder that\u2026","Karl Roessner","Devin, the sale that we've done is sufficient really from a capital and dividend perspective, with the earnings that we\u2019re expecting to fund additional dividends in the out quarters to complete the buyback over the course of its authorization of the one year period. We don't need to sell additional securities, we have factored in the modest degree of paydowns we receive and assume that we continue some degree of off balance sheet from securities paydowns, but that will not come through via additional sales. So any additional sales could generate additional capacity.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW.","Kyle Voigt","Just a question on deposit betas. You previously talked about betas in the range of 20% on the way up and down. But now, as you're potentially approaching that first Fed cut and some competitors are already starting to move on deposit rates, does that help inform your view of whether betas could be a bit higher for this first couple of cuts here? ","And then kind of like a second part of that question, you start to break out some of the rates on your savings product separately. How do you think about the beta as it relates to that product specifically in a rate cut environment?","Chad Turner","Yeah, so just on the overall sweep deposit beta, that 20% that we've quoted is pretty consistent on the up and down acknowledging that the competitive environment and us evaluating what the pure set is doing is something that we take into account. But 20% is a good number there. Obviously, to your point, the beta on our premium savings account is significantly higher, just given the type of product that it is and so if that's going to be a lot more yield sensitive as the Fed cuts. We did break that out not only on the yield table, but also in the footnotes to make sure you can see what the premium savings balances, as you're evaluating the impact on any sort of Fed moves.","Kyle Voigt","And then just a follow up on the off balance sheet cash, I guess, with the Fed curves suggesting maybe three cuts by the end of the year, just wondering if there's anything that you could do to lock in rates in the third party banks or if we should just think about the yield as repricing rather quickly as rates move lower?","Chad Turner","Yeah, I mean, we think that the best thing to do is to leave it predominantly floating, and give us a lot of flexibility to move the cash and respond to the environment. Looking -- we do have the capacity to put on term agreements. But looking at sort of where those would be right now relative to sort of the efficiency of the forward curve, we don't think that is the kind of right thing to be doing here.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Will Nance with Goldman Sachs.","Will Nance","Maybe one on the mechanics of the capital light strategy. So I realize this will generate a lot of excess capital. But I think the transaction itself, not today's transaction, but just the nature of moving things off balance sheet and running down securities is probably net neutral to cash, if I'm thinking about that, right. So I guess in the context of this strategy, driving you guys to potentially pay out more than 100% of earnings, how do you think about generating corporate cash and do we need to think about some sort of incremental funding to go along with that buyback?","Chad Turner","The reduction in capital requirements from the security sales supports a larger dividend in the first quarter that will fund the purchases. So dividends from both the bank and the broker dealer and the periods set up incremental capital flows. From a corporate liquidity perspective, our corporate cash target of 300 million remains intact and we have -- and we will always manage to that target of maintaining 300 million of corporate liquidity at all times. So those are really the mechanics. And if you sort of model that out, I think you'll see that there's quite a bit of capital that has been freed up that will support the buyback program over the period.","Will Nance","Got it. Okay. And I guess my follow up is, when I think about the, what you did this quarter moving predominantly sweep deposits off balance sheet, I think if I heard you correctly, you're in the process of working on the banking related balances as well, is that a fair assumption that once that is set up, the much higher yielding premium savings would be a pretty good candidate to move pretty quickly, just thinking about the incremental margin on those, what are your thoughts there?","Chad Turner","That's correct. I mean, if you think about it, the systems or underlying technology of this, of the bank account is different than the sweep deposit. So, it doesn't have that sort of off balance sheet, on balance sheet, multi charter capability. We are building that out across the bank product, specifically, the premium savings product first. In today's yield curve environment, it really doesn't make a lot of difference in terms of which one you choose to move off. ","Obviously, you're getting better floating rates than sort of the belly of the curve at this point anyway. But if we have a more normalized curve, or some steepest curve, then I think it's -- you'll see very clearly that it makes sense to move the premium savings money versus the sweep deposits. So building that out will give us really the ultimate flexibility in terms of deciding what cash to have off balance sheet versus on balance sheet to maximize sort of the return potential of the overall profile and the return we're getting on the bank\u2019s capital.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris","Looking at your fees and service charges line item, that was a positive surprise versus what we're expecting. If we backed out the fees you get from the off balance sheet cash, you had 6% sequential growth in that line item this quarter on top of 8% sequential growth last quarter. So, we can see the individual line items, but just bigger picture, what is driving the growth in that. It just seems pretty impressive and just wondering how sustainable that level of growth rate is for that particular line item.","Chad Turner","Sure, Chris. So, obviously, every individual line is a bit different. I\u2019d note on the order flow side, we have seen DART mix or be more skewed towards derivatives, for example, this quarter. So even though we saw a bit of it moderate, we did see the derivative piece hold up pretty well there. You can also have a little bit of a mix impact inside of that, that can drive that. So I would describe that as a bit more nuanced around the type of trading environment we see.","On the advisor management and custody fees, we do believe that that will continue to grow, right, that's our managed product portfolio and the good growth we've seen there as well as everything you heard Karl talk about on the advisor services piece where this is the existing custody fees we get from advisor services. And we only expect that to grow, as we continue to build out that platform and the referral network, so I think you'd see some there. And then there is a bit of cyclicality around FX as it relates to corporate services that can, if you look over time, you can see how that can kind of go up and down in any given period. That's a little bit of the color there. But obviously, as we grow off balance sheet, that will be the largest impact to this at least over the short term.","Chris Harris","And the earlier comment about the middle and back office build out that's still going on in advisory, does that mean we shouldn't really be expecting much in the way it flows, until like the latter part of 2020?","Chad Turner","Yeah, I think, look, that's a pretty fair assumption, the way that that's breaking down is, the advisor services business, the LPCA custody platform that we have is quite suitable, quite capable and it's a very nice piece of technology for the underserved sort of portion of the RA market. That's like the 500 million or less sort of under custody, but as we look to build out more -- onboard more, we need to make that process a lot more seamless. And as we build out the referral network, we have the two primary RAs that would come on board and then we have the FC network that's been built out. ","But putting together all that functionality to make the onboarding for those referral clients extremely seamless and easy, those are E*TRADE clients and customers coming through those gates. So that needs to be perfect. We're taking our time, we're doing it the right way. We're building out a very nice model for that, so that we can scale it up quite a bit. So the commitments that we've had and that we talked about earlier on, those commitments are still in place. But you just, you shouldn't expect to see anything until sort of that latter half of 2020 in terms of meaningful growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Campbell with Barclays.","Jeremy Campbell","Most were asked and answered here, just got a quick clarifying question for you Chad. When you said, I think an additional 25 basis point cut relative to your two cut scenario would be 3 basis point impact on NIMs, was that relative to your full year \u201919 guide or was that yield like run rate annualized going forward?","Chad Turner","Yeah, I would describe that as looking at the interest rate sensitivity that we provide you on page 21, excuse me, that's really where that's coming from. That takes our interest earning assets as of the end of the quarter and gives you that sensitivity. So if the overall assets were to grow or to shrink, you would apply that a little differently. That's just on our static balance sheet at that point.","Jeremy Campbell","Okay, so that's more of a run rate go forward though, not relative to the full year \u201919 guide?","Chad Turner","That's correct. It\u2019s a discrete calculation, just as of that point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier","Just one question on expenses, I understand the margin dynamics at the balance sheet move and the buyback focus. But just on the core expenses, I guess, any guidance on how we should be thinking about the overall level? And I might have missed it. But did you guys give the amount? I think you mentioned there was some severance or some severance in the comp, I'm not sure if you gave that level.","Karl Roessner","Yeah, Michael, we talked about 7 million being in comp in the quarter that you could, you could take that as an unusual item. So other than that, the expenses, it was relatively clean, not much to talk about there, just giving you a little bit of food for thought as it relates to going forward. We've talked about that flexibility tactically in any given period. I would also note that protecting our operating margins over the long term is not necessarily just around cutting in nuanced ways in any given period. But it's really more around focusing on cost containment and how we remain efficient as a firm. ","Our industry leading operating margins do come from our business model being a bit more digitally centric than the peer set, which enables us not just to invest in growth on the revenue side, but also to invest in areas where we can be a lot more efficient as the business grows, that we can be more efficient around how we have to add expenses. You've heard Mike talk about that on the ops and tech side before. Those are just examples of how we think about that of investing not only for growth, but also for efficiency.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Sorry if I missed the detail on this. But can you just talk about the accretion expectations from the balance sheet move in the near term and the sensitivity if we are in an environment where the short term rates, let's say, the Fed cuts much more aggressively over the next years, and then the two moves, but the yield curve steepens on the basis of the Fed cuts? So how that sort of sensitivity changes? And then what would that lead you to bring those deposits back on to balance sheet?","Karl Roessner","Sure, we didn't give you the exact accretion on expectation, but I think you can sort of imply the buyback will occur over the course of really the next 12 months, we will really target it at a relatively measured pace, but tried to be as tactical as possible within that measured pace. The securities that we sold were around the 220 yield on the 4.5 billion. And right now, without a Fed cut, we're earning a little over the Fed Fund\u2019s effective rate on the off balance sheet portion. ","We have provided updated rate sensitivities in the investor deck. I would think that for movements in the Fed rates, they\u2019re going to be relatively linear on the short side, meaning if there are multiple cuts over time that you can use that sort of estimate, the change in net interest income on the balance sheet over the next 12 months. And then what happens to the off balance sheet as well. Obviously, if this is a typical life cycle, and we see a broad steepening of the curve, we have the capability of moving those balances back on balance sheet to preserve the revenue generation.","Brian Bedell","And then maybe switching over to the expense outlook, so just back to 2020. Obviously, that we're not looking at 50 plus margin, but what type of operating margin are you thinking is appropriate or you think you can achieve in 2020 with this new revenue dynamic?","Chad Turner","Yeah, that's not something we're guiding to today for 2020. I just note that we continue to be pretty thoughtful on the expense side. I think you can do a bit at the revenue side math, just based on what Mike just gave you around the give up on the balance sheet side versus what you get off and kind of what those dynamics are. But on the expense side, that's really around what we talked about is how do we not only find ways to be smart with the incremental new investment dollars, but how are we making sure that we're containing costs in a moderate revenue environment like that. So I would -- that would be a little bit of the qualitative comments I put around what we think about 2020.","Brian Bedell","If we\u2019re looking for expense levels to stay roughly flattish ex the severance, and then of course, advertising can flex back and forth.","Chad Turner","Nothing we're going to now. I think, as we move towards getting into 2020, we can give you a bit more of an update there.","Brian Bedell","And just one last one on month to date DARTs, if you can disclose that.","Karl Roessner","It was down about 2% from June is what we said in the prepared remarks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.","Michael Cyprys","Just on the balance sheet strategies, you've shifted a bit already off the balance sheet to third parties. I guess, would you ever consider a strategic relationship or partnership to improve the efficiency of the balance sheet by shifting even more cash off balance sheet in a much more meaningful way?","Chad Turner","So I think the business model that we have sort of demonstrates its value in multiple scenarios and across multiple markets. I think we've demonstrated, our ability to take advantage of the model, just with the actions we've done to go off balance sheet and return additional capital to our shareholders. Obviously, in a rising rate environment that we've been in, in the past couple of years, the revenue growth has been quite outstanding from own perspective. So I think, we're quite happy with the current model, not pursuing anything on that strategic front. I think we talked about this quite a bit, in terms of what our acquisitions or partnerships might look like. So I think our model, we're pretty happy with right now.","Michael Cyprys","Okay, great. And then just a quick follow up on the $7 share target by 2023. I think you were assuming that Fed funds held at 2% beyond two cuts this year. I guess if the Fed were to cut to zero, how should we think about how different that $7 figure might look, how should we think about NIM bottoming out in that sort of environment.","Karl Roessner","I mean, the one thing I would say is when we go through this, we were asked, I think, when Mike Pizzi and I were out before any of the chat in a CFO, we talked to investors about some of this plan. It was around, if we go low for long or we go to zero, obviously, this -- the long term plan is extremely challenged. Chad, if you want to give some color around that, but that was?","Chad Turner","Yeah, yeah. I mean, the rate sensitivity in the investor deck for short term rate cuts, it's obviously pretty linear all the way to zero. So you would lose that on the way down. That said, I think as it relates to the long term earnings slide, it really depends on what happens to the overall yield curve and what that looks like to make other decisions around what you\u2019d be able to invest on your balance sheet. So there's lots of nuances to that. Certainly, if there's parallel shifts down or significant cuts from the Fed that get near zero, we are an asset sensitive balance sheet, and that would have impact on long term earnings.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler","So in the prepared remarks, you said you expect deposit rates to be flat, I believe, despite assuming a July Fed rate cut, but just to clarify, with a 25 basis point rate cut, do you still expect deposit sweep rates to be flattish in the third quarter and also if we have a second rate cut, what should be the beta or change in the blended deposit sweep rate with the second cut?","Chad Turner","Yeah, we guided that we would have a rate cut in July and we follow those 20% betas for the sweep, for the non, let\u2019s call a premium savings deposits, and then you can, obviously a lot more sensitive on the premium saving side, that would be flat. If you move to another Fed cut, I think you can just apply, as we said, apply those same 20% betas on the sweep deposits and brokerage cash.","Craig Siegenthaler","And then just my follow up, just given the lower net new asset generation 2Q versus the last few quarters, any thoughts on the run rate in the back half of the year?","Karl Roessner","I mean, look, in terms of generation, in terms of where we are on that new assets, I think this quarter was impacted by some outsized cash outflows around the payment of taxes, right, with some of the tax reform that went on, we definitely saw some outside taxes. The thing that I look at and we look at as a firm in terms of inflows coming in, right, what we've done on the Corporate Services side, the amount of assets that have been on boarded into that pipeline are Advisor Services business going out into 2020, and the assets that that will continue to generate and our core business remains extremely healthy. So I don't, updated guidance on that, Chad, I don't believe we give numbers on that. But I think the, we look at this quarter as seasonally low.","Chad Turner","Yeah, that's right. You can see that, cyclically, if you look over time, so we haven't guided to the rest of the year. But I would note that we have given our views on what long term growth rates for both assets and accounts should look like over the long period of time. We believe those are still reasonable for our business, and would expect to have periods, the overall periods look like that.","Operator","And we have no further questions from the phone lines at this time. I'll turn the call back to your hosts.","Karl Roessner","Thank you all for joining us this evening and we look forward to talking to you in a quarter. Have a good evening.","Operator","That does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."],"8102":["E*TRADE Financial Corp (NASDAQ:ETFC) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 25, 2018  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Karl Roessner - CEO and Director ","Michael Pizzi - CFO","Analysts","Richard Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners","Steven Chubak - Nomura Securities","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank","Conor Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs Group","Michael Cyprys - Morgan Stanley","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG","Douglas Mewhirter - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","Jeremy Campbell - Barclays PLC","Operator","Good evening, and thank you for joining E*TRADE's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call.

No other recordings or copies of this call are authorized or may be relied upon.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Roessner.","Karl Roessner","Thank you, Ash. Good evening, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year results call. It's a pleasure to speak with you as we reflect on an exceptional year. In 2017, we had our work cut out for us and I couldn't be more proud of our team as we completed our to-do list while continuing to deliver for our customers against the backdrop of extreme competition and an unprecedented market environment. So without further ado, I'll get right to the recap of our successes during the year.","We delivered on our core initiatives, reinvigorating our brand with a bold new marketing campaign, completing the integration of OptionsHouse and delivering meaningful enhancements to the customer experience. We made solid progress against our brokerage growth targets, setting a multiple of records across DARTs, derivatives mix, brokerage assets, managed products and customer margin balances.","We turbocharged our growth efforts at E*TRADE Corporate Services, implementing nearly $6 billion in new client plans during the year and growing our pipeline to include $14 billion in plan assets that we expect to implement over the next 12 months. We efficiently deployed capital, onboarding deposits and growing our balance sheet by more than $14 billion, while launching and completing more than 1\/3 of our $1 billion share buyback program.","We further optimized our capital structure following the midyear reduction of our consolidated Tier 1 leverage threshold, which left us with more than $500 million of excess capital. Today, we are announcing a similar reduction in our bank Tier 1 leverage thresholds by 50 basis points to 7%. That leaves us with nearly $270 million of excess capital based on year-end levels at the bank. We improved our corporate debt profile, capitalizing on our own improvements and attractive capital market conditions to refinance our corporate debt in our first ever deal as an investment grade issuer, reducing the average coupon from a 5 handle to a 3 handle. We improved our strategic positioning, announcing the planned acquisition of a top-notch RIA custody platform, prudently entering a growing market while also filling an important need within our Corporate Services channel.","And finally, we delivered impressive operating and financial results, growing annual revenue by 22% to $2.4 billion, fueled by record-setting brokerage activity and our balance sheet expansion. We also exhibited disciplined expense control as we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 480 basis points over the same period.","When considering just Q4, revenue was up 25% and adjusted op margin was up by more than 600 basis points over the year-ago period, truly remarkable in light of the commission cuts earlier in the year. So to sum up 2017, it was an awesome year. And to kick off the new year, we are pleased to announce today an agreement to purchase over 1 million retail brokerage accounts from Capital One for $170 million. Opportunities like this in which we can efficiently add a large number of customers to our highly scalable platform do not come along often. So with Cap One's decision to exit the business, we are more than happy to seize it. This is a financially compelling purchase, as Mike will cover with you shortly, with a price well below our typical customer acquisition costs for a broad set of customers that meet our target profile.","Moreover, this deal materially expands our U.S. household penetration, and we revel in the opportunity to meaningfully deepen their engagement as we introduce them to what E*TRADE has to offer, a broader product suite, a greater service experience and significantly expanded resources, education, tools and functionality across our suite of offerings. We expect this deal to close by the third quarter.","Turning back to our operating metrics. We saw an impressive resurgence in customer engagement in 2017 and it only intensified in the fourth quarter. The upward trend in the equity markets drew multiple all-time highs propelled trading activity, driving DARTs for the year of 214,000, an annual record and up 30% from 2016.","For the fourth quarter, our DARTs of 236,000 were the highest ever, with monthly DARTs in both November and December ranking among the top 3 months in E*TRADE's recorded history. And while the ebb and flow of retail trading is bound to deplete these metrics at some point, we have yet to see any signs of slowing from fourth quarter levels, with January month-to-date DARTs tracking around 315,000, roughly a 30% increase from December. Customer margin balances ended the year at $9.1 billion, also a firm record, though we have seen them come in a bit in January.","2017 was a year of marked progress across each of our key growth metrics. So to briefly cover where we stand on each. For the year, we attracted 172,000 net new brokerage accounts, representing the most accounts we've added organically in over a decade and a 5% growth rate, squarely within our targeted range. Net new brokerage assets of $12.2 billion in 2017 makes for our strongest year of net inflows ever.","With the great many initiatives rolled out over the course of the year to drive our growth on this front, we are overwhelmingly pleased with the result but are even more encouraged by what 2018 will bring as we enter the year firing on all cylinders. Our derivative mix for the year was 30%, up from 26% in 2016, which included OptionsHouse for the last few months of the year.","In the fourth quarter, our derivatives mix declined to 29% from 32% in the prior quarter as the recent surge in equity trading swamped the effect of our pronounced and continued growth in derivative volumes. The rollout of additional derivative tools and capabilities to the E*TRADE customer base, our ramp-up in our future's product offering and concerted marketing and education efforts should help enrich our derivatives mix as we work towards our goal of 35%. However, we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that in this truly phenomenal year, our absolute level of derivatives trade is up 30% year-over-year.","Managed assets have grown to $5.4 billion, up nearly 40% for the year with the vast majority of that growth coming from net inflows. Given our success to date, we are well on our way to exceeding our goal of $6 billion in managed balances. ","In the fourth quarter alone, a refocused sales effort and refinements to the product set led to a pick up in the pace of net inflows which accounted for nearly 80% of the sequential growth in the quarter. As for our Corporate Services channel, in 2017, we implemented nearly 6 billion in stock plan assets across more than 48,000 plan participants, a 25% increase from the prior year. Last quarter, we discussed $8 billion of plan assets in the pipeline to be implemented. Today, that number stands at $14 billion across more than 135,000 accounts that we expect to bring on to our award-winning platform over the next 12 months. I'll speak more about this channel in a moment.","And so with 2017 behind us and with those many accomplishments, we will once again raise the bar and outline what we seek to achieve in 2018. And if these areas of focus seem familiar, they should. Frankly, we have a simple yet powerful strategy upon which we will continue to execute intensely. First, we will continue to up our game for the active traders segment, focusing on our derivatives traders. Last year, we enjoyed significant success with the integration of OptionsHouse and the launch of the new Power E*TRADE model, but that's just the beginning. As we're now busy making this integrated offering the best it can be, not just through further enriching the capabilities of our #1 platform, but through the personal service, education and resources we offer for active traders.","Our second area of focus comes from the other side of the house, our investing offering. We very recently reimagined and aligned our investment advice continuum to more clearly show customers and prospects how we can best serve them, from our basic robo to our fully customized portfolio offerings, all as a part of 1 cohesive investing spectrum. This important work serves as the bedrock of our sales and marketing efforts for 2018 in the investing space. We are not all things to all people, but for those investors looking to take some control over their finances, no matter how large or small the role they want to play, we are the place for them.","Our third area of focus is our Corporate Services business in which we aim to continue to build our large stable of corporate clients and our overall participant base and further enhance our offering for both sets of customers.","With the leading technology platform in Equity Edge Online, along with superior service and a #1 ranking in customer satisfaction and loyalty, our Corporate Services channel is already well positioned to win RFP battles, and the value proposition is only getting better. Remaining true to our heritage, we are continuing to install digital solutions to solve cross-industry headaches. Stock plan administration has traditional been an analog business, and we set ourselves apart by using the E*TRADE ethos to evolve the space into a digital environment backed by the best stock plan expertise around. Expect us to continue to be a leader in this space and to bring additional corporate clients on board in 2018.","On the stock plan participant side, an important account and asset growth area for us. We are in the midst of expanding the products we offer with resources like securities-based lending, access to our revamped investing advice continuum post vest and most exciting, in the coming year, we plan to provide an avenue for high net worth and executive participants to access independent advisers through TCA, filling a long-standing gap in our offering.","TCA is the fourth area of focus, and we are more than a little bit excited to put our resources behind this business to help turbocharge their growth. We will deploy the full power of the E*TRADE brand behind their platform, and as I mentioned, we will develop a referral program for certain RIAs on the TCA platform to position their offering to those Corporate Service clients and our current and prospective retail brokerage clients in need of that level of service.","TCA has an exceptional platform and a fantastic team. When combined with E*TRADE, we think there's a lot to like in the RIA space.","And last but not least is our primary mission, delighting our customers. We will continue to focus on the customer experience to deliver fantastic interactions across all touch points. More than anything, this is about making E*TRADE exceptionally easy to do business with. And you've heard us speak time and again about the process by which we continually improve the experience for our customers. Make no mistake, this effort will continue in earnest in 2018 and beyond.","With these five areas of focus, we also know we must get the word out. To this end, our marketing team has been hard at work. Last year was about reinvigorating the brand. This year, we'll further evolve and drive our Power E*TRADE campaign, especially in light of last year's success. We will put more of E*TRADE's muscle behind our investing and returning offerings, including a making a big splash on the national stage. We will continue to focus on talking to the E*TRADE value proposition, and we will put our brand behind the TCA offering to help drive growth in that business and further diversify our revenues. So bottom line, we have much to accomplish in 2018 and a great many tasks on our new list. But if past is prologue, 2018 stands for to be another incredible year for E*TRADE.","Before closing, let me briefly comment on the recently passed tax law, which will significantly lower our effective tax rate and improve our rate of capital generation beginning in 2018. Mike will go into the details on the direct impact on to our financials, but I wanted to address the recurring question for our investors. How will it affect how E*TRADE operates? The short answer is not much. But for the significant improvement to our bottom line results, we'll always be focused on ensuring we are competitive in the marketplace, while investing as needed in our people, our technology and any new business opportunities that may create value for our shareholders. And as we continue to invest in growing our business, this lower rate does expand our options as the payback equation improves and more opportunities may meet our internal return hurdles. That said, we will continue to exercise disciplined expense control, and any investments will be made within our operating margin framework. Barring dramatic shifts in competition, we see this tax reform as universally positive for our shareholders as the benefit will be passed directly to the bottom line.","To wrap up, 2017 was a banner year with E*TRADE with a long release of achievements, and we have worked tirelessly to deliver all of them. And while the E*TRADE model is optimally geared to the current environment, with the systems and service offering that flex considerably to manage surges in customer activity and a balance sheet and capital position that enables us to maximize the value of customer relationships, it's important to recognize that without the dedication, focus and everyday hard work of this team, we would not have been able to fully take advantage of the opportunity.","So above all, I owe a debt of gratitude to the folks that have not only raised their games to meet the market need, but have done so while setting us up for future growth. Now it's with great anticipation and renewed energy that we look forward for 2018, a year of intensified execution and delivery, to continue driving toward our goal of becoming the #1 broker and advice to both traders and investors alike.","With that, I will turn it over to our CFO, Mike Pizzi.","Michael Pizzi","Thanks, Karl. For the quarter, we reported net income of $129 million or $0.48 per share, which includes a handful of notable items that had the net impact of reducing results by $44 million or $0.16 per share. To review, first, we recorded an additional income tax expense of $58 million due to the revaluation of our federal net deferred tax assets as a result of tax reform. Second, there was a $26 million provision benefit in the quarter as we ended the period with an allowance for loan losses of $74 million, and we recorded net recoveries for the eighth consecutive quarter. And third, we incurred $3 million in expense related to crossing the $50 billion regulatory threshold.","Net revenues of $637 million were up $38 million from the prior quarter, driven by continued growth in the balance sheet, a higher net interest margin and increased customer engagement overall. Net interest income increased $28 million to $419 million during the quarter as average interest-earning assets grew by $2.5 billion and net interest margin expanded 7 basis points to 292 basis points.","Stronger securities lending revenue, our debt refi, better security yields and higher average margin balances were the most impactful drivers of the sequential NIM expansion. Our average reinvestment rate on securities is currently in the 250 to 270 basis point range. In terms of forecasting 2018 NIM, if we hold customer margin balances flat with their current levels, which as Karl noted are down from year end, and assume no Fed funds increases during the year, we expect NIM to land in the low to mid-280s. However, if we project the Fed funds increase in March as the market broadly assumes and model some level of deposit repricing, we forecast NIM in the mid- to high 280s. I'll cover ongoing balance sheet growth dynamics in a moment.","Commission revenue of $109 million increased 9% sequentially, driven by a 15% increase in DARTs to $236,000, partially offset by a $0.35 decline in our average commission per trade, which was $7.41 for the quarter. Both the volume and rate reflect the significant recent upturn in equity trading, which has had a dilutive effect on our derivative mix. We are also witnessing strong adoption of our Power E*TRADE offering and have more customers meeting the activity threshold to qualify for our lower pricing tier.","We are quite pleased with the increase in customer engagement and with our progress on the derivatives front despite the dilution to commission per trade. Going forward, we expect our CPT to be in the 740 to 760 range, with the lower end more likely when equity trading volumes are elevated, like they were in Q4. Fees and service charges increased $1 million to $93 million in the quarter as trading volume drove higher order flow revenue and managed product balances drove an increase in asset-based fees. This was partially offset by a decline in reorg fees and lower off-balance-sheet cash revenue as we onboard an additional $1.2 billion in deposits during the quarter.","The yield on third-party customer cash averaged 123 basis points, up from 119 basis points in the prior quarter, reflecting movements in short-term rates. With the December rate hike, we expect this yield to rise to approximately 136 basis points when the full benefit is reflected during Q1. Non-interest expense was $364 million, up $17 million from the prior quarter, excluding the $58 million charge for extinguishment of debt in the third quarter. This quarter's adjusted operating margin, which excludes provision benefit, was 43%, an improvement from the prior quarter of nearly 100 basis points.","Total marketing expense of $43 million came in slightly below the low end of the $45 million to $50 million range we provided last quarter as we shifted the timing of planned investments into Q1. Looking on to 2018 and consistent with our commitments from last quarter, given the December Fed hike, we are targeting a full year adjusted operating margin of 43%. This assumes no additional rate hikes and incorporates our plans to increase investments in the business over the course of the year, including a ramp-up in marketing spend to a total of around $200 million for the year and some level of deposit repricing.","If the Fed were to raise rates in March as is widely anticipated, depending on the timing and magnitude of any deposit pricing, we'd expect the full year margin to range from 43.5% to 44.5%. On the capital front, it was a busy quarter indeed. First, in early December, we issued $300 million of preferred stocks to fund the pending acquisition of TCA. Given the attractiveness of the preferred market at the time, we decided to go early and came away very satisfied with pricing at a 5.3% coupon on the transaction.","Second, as Karl discussed, we have lowered our Tier 1 leverage ratio threshold at the bank may 50 basis points to 7%. And finally during the fourth quarter, we repurchased 3.9 million shares at an average price of $44.97 or $175 million in total. As of today, we have just under $640 million remaining and we are on track to complete the $1 billion program by the end of 2018. As for today's announced acquisition of over 1 million retail brokerage accounts from Capital One, we expect the transaction to close by the third quarter and plan to fund the purchase with corporate cash on hand. With this transaction, we will bring approximately $1.7 billion in cash and $150 million in margin loans on to the balance sheet. The economics are highly compelling with the return on invested capital in the mid- to high-teens and accretion that is neutral to 2018 earnings and about $0.06 positive to 2019 based on the conservative business assumptions and including all the related costs in the first half of the year.","With respect to balance sheet growth. A major initiative in 2017 was onboarding of the off-balance-sheet deposits to bring our balance sheet to a target of $63 billion by year-end, which we have successfully completed. As we have noted in the past, we will maintain some level of customer deposits off-balance-sheet to maximize insurance coverage for our customers. Today, that equates to roughly $3 billion. So we are modestly above that level with over $5.5 billion of cash off-balance-sheet at year-end.","Going forward, we would expect our balance sheet to be influenced by the following factors, first, additional deposits we plan to onboard during the year, including $1.6 billion of off-balance-sheet sweep in Q1, $1.2 billion of TCA customer cash to be brought on at the close of the deal expected in Q2 and $1.7 billion of customer cash and approximately $150 million of customer margin loans from the account acquisition we announced today. Second, growth in the core brokerage business that includes deposit growth, which is affected by inflows from new and existing customers, customers buying and selling activity and margin balances. Third, and economic decisions we may make around directing that growth on- or off-balance-sheet based on the shape of the curve. Today, the economics overwhelmingly favor growing the balance sheet. And fourth, the lower capital threshold of the bank starting in Q1, which gives us additional capacity to add assets barring any other attractive uses of capital.","As for corporate cash, we ended the quarter at $541 million, up $232 million sequentially, reflecting the $300 million in gross proceeds from the preferred issuance and $175 million in share repurchases during the quarter.","In addition, there was a $125 million distribution from the broker-dealer that was partially offset by a $50 million capital infusion to the bank to address some of the immediate impact from the DTA write-down and funding needed for the TCA acquisition. For the first quarter of 2018, we expect the distribution from the broker-dealer to be $125 million.","Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 37%, excluding the impact of tax reform. While this tax reform reduced the statutory income tax rate by 14 percentage points to the new 21% rate, this law includes other provisions that impact our future overall effective tax rate. The 2 most important are banks with total assets of over $50 billion may no longer deduct FDIC insurance premiums and the deductibility of certain executive compensation over $1 million has been eliminated.","While we continue to expect quarterly volatility due to the impact of share-based compensation awards and future revaluations of our state deferred tax assets, we currently expect the full year 2018 tax rate to be approximately 27%. As Karl mentioned, after continuing to invest in the business, we plan to pass the vast majority of this savings to our shareholders by way of direct bottom line benefit.","In closing, we are very satisfied with 2017's blockbuster results and look forward to continuing to deliver value for our customers and shareholders.","Ash, with that, we'd like to open up for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard Repetto","I guess, the first question is on Cap One, and I think we know back panel a bit, it was the old ShareBuilder, and they -- well, the low trading activity of the accounts, I'm only coming up with 4 trades per account per year. So I guess, I'm trying to get to where you're seeing, I guess -- the accretion, I guess, is from the cash, but could you get -- go into how you're going to incorporate it, given the different business model with ShareBuilder and the low trading activity. But I get the cash side of it.","Michael Pizzi","Yes, we see Rich about 16,000 DARTs from the account. So you are right, they are lower active than our account base. They don't have the percentage of active traders that we have, but we're very excited by the potential that's within the account base and for us to engage with them on our platform. In terms of getting to the accretion, you have to look at the $1.9 billion in brokerage-related cash, $1.7 billion of -- which is available sweep cash to be brought on to the balance sheet. The key drivers of that, really, in terms of looking at these accounts, and this is an account purchase, so we're taking these accounts and then modeling any expenses that we will drive on our platform against it is what gets you to the accretion.","Karl Roessner","Yes. And Rich, looking at the number of household that support these accounts and the marketing efforts that we have, when you couple that with our offerings, our education, our tools and platform, this is something that we think is a home run for us in terms of new account acquisition and furthering deepening the relationships that the Cap One and the predecessor had with these customers. These are individuals who did interact or do interact with their finances, and that's a perfect target customer for us in addition to the -- and so the rest of the deal. So to me, it's a win-win.","Richard Repetto","Okay. And then the one follow-up would be on the TCA acquisition. Originally, it was $50 million, I think, $50 million an trailing 12-month revenue. And then going out to, I believe, in 2019, $80 million. Given the appreciation of market much higher than what -- what we've seen in the back half of 2017 and January, any update on the accretion target for TCA or what's going on there?","Karl Roessner","I mean, look, Rich, we haven't brought that one onboard yet. And obviously, we'll continue to work through the integration and we'll have more information as that one becomes available. We like what we see with this business, right? I've been out with them, I've seen the platform. I've been out to go meet the top 6 or 7 RIAs by size who are on their platform, and I really like what I see from the offering, from the individuals I went to go meet these folks with and from the compliments we received from the RIA's who are on the platform themselves. So it's -- for us, it's a very solid acquisition. I think, more to come, and we absolutely see upside here.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet.","Steven Chubak","So I wanted to start off with a question on the NIM. In your earnings walk slide, you showed the benefit of parallel shift. And thinking back to your guidance from a years ago when this slide was first introduced, you spoke to a normalized spread of around 300 bps. Mike, I know you talked about some of the dynamics around how that might traject in the coming year, but just given the composition of your balance sheet today and based on the forward curve which has about 3-plus rate hikes, at least in the coming years, and the Fed dot plot reflects something similar. I'm just wondering, any event of multiple rate hikes, how we should be thinking about a reasonable normalized NIM target, what should we be contemplating there?","Michael Pizzi","Well, we're bringing on securities balances in that 250 to 270 basis point range, and we're investing in the belly of the curve. And those rates have been increasing over time with the Fed. The curve is flattening, but you're getting -- for 25 basis points Fed moves, you are seeing some increase in our overall investment rate. As the balance sheet grows, we are 292 this quarter, right? As the balance sheet's growing, we're growing slight -- below that overall spread level. But if we see 3 interest rate hikes, the shape of the curve will matter greatly. But as that reinvestment yield gets applied, you will see higher overall spread if we continue to see higher rates in where -- where we are investing our money relative to those Fed moves.","Steven Chubak","Got it. And then just one more for me on capital management. Just given the second windfall that you guys spoke to from the lower tax rate, even when taking into consideration the additional capital that's required to support the bank growth as well as the completion of the $1 billion buyback, it looks like your ratios are still going to run well in excess of that 6.5% target. Now I'm just wondering how you're think about your capital management priorities. We did see the deal that was announced today, but I'm wondering whether you have any appetite to actually accelerate the buyback plan.","Michael Pizzi","Well, we have two deals that are going to close now, so we have to be a little bit flexible around timing to make sure that we have the right capital position when they close. But we are committed to seeing through in 2018 the overall level of buybacks to the $1 billion level. You're right, from the tax -- the tax really doesn't greatly affect 2018's capital position. There was a movement down in capital from the revaluation that occurred this quarter. But as we look forward, we were essentially accreting capital at a pretax rate as we earned out the DTA. But when we look in the out years, in 2019, going forward, you start to see a significant build in capital from the tax-cut simply because of just the lower absolute cash taxes that have to be modeled for those years once we get past the usage of the DTA.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. We'll move on to the next question which comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier","I guess just a question on the Corporate Services. Given some of the momentum that you're seeing there, if I look at that backlog or the $14 billion that you noted, how should we be thinking about as that comes on like the potential economics? And in that business, just from a competitive standpoint, how are you winning the -- those new assets and accounts? Meaning is it competitive on pricing, is it some of the new initiatives that you had to put in place? Just want to try and understand further growth potential, not only the assets, but the economics.","Karl Roessner","Michael, thank you, I love talking about this business so it's -- thanks for the question. The Corporate Services business has always been a gem of ours at E*TRADE in terms of what we're able to provide in our Equity Edge Online platform and the services that we're able to provide for some of the largest corporations out there in terms of stock plan and equity, plan administration. So when we walk in, we do compete with a number of larger competitors than ourselves. And when we do win them, it's based on the platform itself, based on our sales and service organization and based on our team's ability to be extremely nimble and make the changes that are necessary, right? Because people, when they deal with their stock plan, they want ease-of-use, they want their plan participants to be able to see what the company wants them to see, not necessarily what the vendor wants them to see, and there's a lot of customization and a lot of requests they come across.","Our guys have been very good at getting things done for our corporate customers. So when we win, it's based on the Equity Edge Online platform itself, which has been #1 for 5, 6 years running now as well as the team of individuals who go in. And then the implementation team who comes back and services and make sure those folks get onboarded right and are there to sort of clean up and make sure the customers are satisfied and happy with the offering. And it's also a give and take and a constant back and forth with the corporate client to continue to upgrade, update and be there to really handhold as they implement and they make changes to their own corporate stock plans. So that's been very helpful for us and -- coming in the market dislocation as we have with a number of larger competitors switching over the systems, it's absolutely been a perfect storm for our team based on Alpharetta and then obviously the West Coast. I mean, they've done a great job landing some very large corporate clients.","You've seen that grow from $8 billion over the next 12 months to $14 billion. They've been winning some very nice accounts from some of our competitors and we're seeing what we talked about come to fruition. So when I look at how to look at that $14 billion, that's where you have to get into, how do we as a company start servicing that $14 billion in assets that comes into stock plan participants accounts better than we have in the past, right? Traditionally, we've said as it hits the accounts we hold somewhere in the 15% range, a year later after it divests and is actually in the equity account, so in the E*TRADE brokerage account for those folks, how do we raise that number? How do we raise that bar? And that's some of the things I talked about in our prepared remarks.","We have an executive services team that we believe we've now armed with the right tools to really help those individuals deal with their finances all the way from our basic robo to our managed products in the investing advice continuum to helping them learn about how to employ derivative strategies or option strategies, or the next step will be to implement with TCA, if they are looking for an RIA, we can have a few of those on the platform to recommend out, so we keep custody of the assets and the cash that's held in the account. And then there's the securities-based lending product that we rolled, which we think is perfect for execs and others who come into newly found wealth in an exploding stock market who don't want to sell and take the tax in, right, they can monetize it through E*TRADE Bank. So we think we're really in a good position in this space. I can't give you exact numbers or lay it out there for you in terms of, we expect it to move this much. I just know that we finally have the right team both on the corporate side of the house landing new big clients and we also have the right team on the executive services side and on the product side to drive at this in a way that we'll finally find out whether or not we can actually do something here.","Michael Carrier","Okay. And just as a follow-up. Just on the strategic side, given that TCA transaction and then on these Cap One accounts, is that anything like when we look at the level of activity, is there are a lot of like potential new transactions that you're seeing out there? Is it a shift in strategy? Is it just that the capital that you have that you can deploy, you're now at a level where you have more options? Just trying to get a sense sort of strategically how you guys are focused on growth versus the other strategic options that were discussed 12, 18 months ago.","Karl Roessner","No, no, I'm happy to. So we are still maniacally focused on our growth goals. We set those out in the 4 categories that we've talked about at quite some length, and that's exactly where we intend to be, right? We're driving at those. That's where our teams have been set up. Those goals and our progress towards those goals we report to you all on a quarterly basis. They hang on our walls in every office at E*TRADE, and our whole company is geared towards getting those done. So that's first and foremost. I would go back to actually the first time we talked about what we're thinking about in acquisition land or in inorganic growth. That's all complementary to where we are. We knew we had a hole in the RIA space in terms of diversifying some of our earnings streams, and I think we've gone about that in an intelligent and thoughtful way with a custody platform to start, right? We're still not competing with our customers, we're not going out and taking away from our STs who are helping our customers on a daily basis. It will be an additive to have third party RIAs on the TCA platform. So that was first and foremost we talked about. Let's go out and get a custody platform, and we publicly announced that.","We also said the next thing that we'd like to do, first and foremost, is think about scale, right? If there are any other scale opportunities out there to grow scale in the marketplace where the last big asset traded away a year ago or so, that we would do that. This Capital One transaction literally came up, the price was right and we went after scale. The other 2 areas that we talked about were stock plan, if there was a scale play there or something additive to our technology. I haven't heard about anything missing in our Equity Edge Online offering but if there was, we'd look at that as well if it was -- if it made sense from a capital perspective. And the other side is just around additional products or features or services that it might be better to buy versus build. We haven't found any of those yet either, but there's some exciting technology out there. But I'd take you back to the beginning of that, which is, we're not looking at anything transformational. We are not changing the strategic direction of this firm. Our growth goals are first and foremost where we will be and what we're driving toward as we come out of -- come in to 2018 and out of 2017.","The acquisitions are additive and they will all be looked after the same capital intensive lens we've talked about, right? If we can find value, we're going to do it. And if it makes more sense to return it to our shareholders, that's what we're going to do.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Mike, in your comments, I think you'd made reference to the potential for deposit repricing if we get another Fed fund hike. Can you maybe put a little more color around that? What kind of deposit beta do you think you might expect here in the next hike?","Michael Pizzi","Sure. Just looking at kind of -- going back to the December hike, in our 43% operation margin guidance, we are leaving ourselves some flexibility to be a little bit more tactical on rates, whether that's additional negotiated cash rates or whether that's moving our deposit rates. In terms of if the Fed does raise in March, it sets up a pretty wide range, really, in effective operating margin. If we took no action at all, it would put you up very close to that 44.5% level that we talked about in the prepared remarks, and I think you can back into the type of deposit beta to get to the 43.5% type level. It's really consistent, really, with our historical beta if you go back a very long period of time overall.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, got it. That makes sense. And then margin lending growth has been really solid. Could you maybe help us frame out how to think about it from here. And I think I thought I saw in the average balance sheet that the yield on the margin assets compressed a bit. Given the December hike, I guess I would have assumed the opposite. So was that maybe price cut for active traders given some of those efforts there? Or how should we think about that from here?","Michael Pizzi","Look, to answer the last question first, there is an ebb and flow and as the book builds, it builds in some of the customers who have the negotiated rates. So it's not necessarily more negotiated activity, it's just the increase in balance that you see is customers who have lower rates, larger customers drawing that balance that has the effect of showing that sort of shift in the overall margin yield over the period. In terms of thinking about the overall margin balance, the balance is really the -- it's the best indicator of retail risk appetite that there is, and it shows the overall level of engagement of the retail sector getting to a level of that $9.1 billion in the period, which is a record high for us. The engagement level is high, customers are active. We're seeing it day in and day out. The margin balance ebbs and flows a little bit, it goes up and down a little bit. But we're very pleased overall with the levels that we achieved.","Karl Roessner","And I think, look, as we look at margin and we take a look at what we've spent money on over the past couple of years in terms of our enterprise risk management system and the realtime daily monitoring and realtime monitoring that we do on those margin accounts, both to protect our customers and the firm, I think we're in a lot better position in terms of analyzing the margin balance that gets put on our books. And we're also very active in terms of setting margin requirements, the right levels for these securities, so that you're not chasing customers away or giving them reason to leave you. So you've seen some real showing up in our enterprise risk management capabilities around this, both in the business side and then in our second line of defense, coming back through. So very pleased with where this is. There's really nothing we would ever do or try to do to accelerate this, but it is absolutely investor confidence out there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Conor Fitzgerald with Goldman Sachs.","Conor Fitzgerald","I appreciate you helping us frame up where the pretax margin could go kind of based on what happens with the Fed. But Karl, maybe a broader question for you just given some of the potential revenue drivers you could have at your back this year, whether it's either hikes or if we see this type of sustained retail activity that would obviously be very helpful as well. But if it turns out to be another very good revenue year for E*TRADE, how should investors think about your operating leverage in that type of environment? Can you discuss a little bit how you're thinking about the trade-off between generating more operating leverage versus reinvesting that excess revenue back into the business?","Karl Roessner","Sure. I mean, I hope over the past 16 months or so, that folks are beginning to realize that this is quite a disciplined management team in terms of setting an operating margin and going after it and hitting it, right ? If there are areas that we need to focus on to reinvest in the business, we are going to continue to live within the operating margin framework that we've set out. So that's the way we approach all of these discussions, so that's why when we talk about what happens as a result of some of the bottom line growth that we anticipate given some of the recent changes that we expect that the fall directly to the bottom line. So what I'd like to see longer-term is obviously expansion in the operating margin if there are reasons to invest in the business. The folks who are asking for those dollars are going to need to show the executive team here where the growth and revenue is coming from and if that investment is worth the investment that we're making in order to benefit our shareholders go forward. And that's just -- it's the way we approach everything, Conor, here.","Conor Fitzgerald","That's helpful. And then appreciate your comments on Pro E*TRADE being very helpful in driving your growth. I'm just a bit curious what type of feedback you're getting from the customers that you're winning this platform? And then how important a driver when you win those customers is the price point and does that feed into your overall thoughts in the relationship between pricing and customer acquisition?","Karl Roessner","Yes. What I've seen on that front in terms of the E*TRADE Pro platform, it's the package, right? It's the overall platform itself with a pretty nice experience that customers are able to get and drive with the tools that we have on that. And then it's the customer service side, so our active trader sales and service team that is there with the people its offered to. And there's the 30 trade per quarter, which is obviously not a hyperactive trade that we've talked about, a lot of this, and that, we've seen the most expansion. So I think people like the idea that they get additional value for an increased number of trades. We've seen some of that obviously hit our commission per trade line, the CPT that Mike talked about. And we like the adoption and the uptick that we've seen in the platform. So far so good in terms of bringing new customers on, and also helping to educate some of our customers about using more active strategies on their accounts. So it's all-in so far win-win. More to see in '18 as we put some more power behind it and we have a full year of it being rolled out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.","Michael Cyprys","Just on distribution and partnerships, what the question evolves around here, we've seen the number in the industry -- others in the industry begin to partner with technology and platform companies. Just curious your perspective on that, is that something of interest to E*TRADE? And just curious how you see the nature of distribution evolving over the next, say, 3 to 5 years and the role that large platform technology companies could have, either as a partner to acquire new customers, to access your existing customers or potential role of them being a disrupter or competitor to your business.","Karl Roessner","The technology is moving in a way that is fairly amazing to watch every day. And one of the things that we look at here is really getting back to our roots and getting it on the innovation side. So reestablishing internally what we have as E*TRADE labs and looking at the new technologies that are out there and how we can apply them and now they may be helpful for our customers, whether interacting with us through chat, through voice, through some of the other things that are now becoming commonplace, that's the things that we're looking at. If that's a build on our own, a joint venture or a partnership go forward, we're looking at other ways to acquire customers through partnerships with third parties. We'll absolutely take a look at all of that. We're not going to move away from our ethos of being sort of a self-directed online brokerage platform. But if there are other technologies that labs comes back with or that our product guys want us to go and take a look at, as long as it fits within E*TRADE and the ethos we have, that's where we'll be. We've always been technology forward, we've always been a financial technology company first and we absolutely plan to do that.","Michael Cyprys","Okay. And then just on the customer experience, you touched upon that earlier. Just wondering if you can elaborate a bit on that more in terms of what's on your to-do list in terms of improving the overall customer experience. Maybe you could speak to some of the technology enhancements that you're thinking about.","Karl Roessner","In terms of technology enhancements or customer service, what I really get back to are the easy things, right? The customer wins that you should be able to have on a daily basis because you have a great group of customer service individuals who deal with your customers every day and who talk to you about pain points, and they have to help customers through, whether it be with tax, finding tax documentation, uploading documentation to our system, ease of navigation around the website, making sure that all of our interactions with you are seamless, so that you have the same type of interaction across your mobile, your tablet, your desktop, if you're still in that mode. And that's really where -- what it comes down to. So those are some of the easy wins that we talk about here. And it's a constant to-do list that we have, so it's ever-changing. But we've had some nice wins and we've been able to lower some of our call volumes, which allows us to help customers with real issues they have around trading or around needing help.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Maybe just go back to that Capital One deal on the accretion assumptions. I think, Mike, you mentioned there fairly conservative assumptions. Can you talk about to what extent do you think you can improve the trade per account of 4x? And then just to think about the incremental margin, operating margin on these accounts when you actually -- you get that converted, if you can give some color on that?","Michael Pizzi","Yes. So the booking of the number per trades per account, we are fairly -- we're very conservative in terms of the accretion number and our ability to improve that. We are -- obviously, we're putting an enhanced platform in front of the customer. They will have access to new features, new investment vehicles that they don't have today. We think that's worth something in the short run. But in the 2019 numbers, we are very extremely conservative in terms of the revenue side. Most of this is just taking the top line revenue that the accounts are generating on our platform. We'd make a modest investment in service, a modest investment in technology for the number of accounts that we're taking. That's sort of the expense base. And then overall, you come away with the type of accretion that's shown both on the cash balance and on the trades. In terms of the customer base, we're very optimistic. These are investment-style customers who are building wealth over time.","We think in terms of our new sort of investment continuum of products, our robo-adviser, that we can position our products into these customers very well, grow wallet share over time. Engage with them, show them, use our education offerings to deliver education that should increase the number of trades over time. And I think that's why we're very optimistic about the long-run potential that really stretches beyond the accretion or the ROIC-type levels that we are talking about into really the long-run value creation that a deal like this could drive.","Brian Bedell","Great. That's great color. And then just on trading in general, you mentioned -- I think Karl you mentioned on the potential for more options -- more work on the options side and offering the futures products. Can you just comment on whether your plans on offering Bitcoin trading and how you see the progress of that coming through in 1Q? I think your competitor, Ameritrade, mentioned this resurgent cryptocurrency, blockchain and cannabis stocks trading in the last couple of months. I'm wondering if you're seeing the same type of development in your starts?","Karl Roessner","Thank you for that. So we do have both the CBOE and CME products available on our side and those are both been launched. We were very careful in particular about the types of clients and the types of individuals that we let -- have the opportunity to trade those and to get involved. And it's really around setting risk and margin requirements proactively and making sure that you're reviewing them daily. I mean, you don't want to let just any customer or sort of a new retail trader get into some of those products picking on the future side. And we're being very thoughtful about it, so that you have to have an existing funded futures account to have those available to you. Talking in general about securities on blockchain or blockchain-named stocks, in the cannabis trade, I mean, the cannabis trade for us obviously represents a new type of market high, which is interesting. But when you look at crypto and cannabis, yes, the volumes have been up big in January. ","As we said, to date, we're looking at about 315,000 DARTs and about 9% of those on average has been crypto and cannabis related or blockchain and cannabis related more appropriately. So that's sort of both sides of the coin, those are obviously available for trade. There has been some high volume. But on the futures side, it's just not a material offering or product for us and there has not been material adoption or uptake in either one of those yet.","Brian Bedell","Right. And in terms of the product -- I'm sorry, the technology offering, the ramp-up in the first quarter on that side, is there greater traction that you expect or greater rollout of technology that you expect over the next quarter or so?","Karl Roessner","Yes. I think we're in a stage. And I said it in the prepared remarks, and just to elaborate, we're always in a state of constant evolution in terms of how we get our customers more, right, more of what they're looking. So we are constantly updating, upgrading and new production roles going in to add new features and make sure the functionality and tools are there, and listening to what -- what do those derivatives traders, the more active set, what do they need? What don't we have in front of them that's helpful? What are they going elsewhere to use? And that's a constant update and upgrade, and that's what we've been rolling out. We've been having some great response and keeping those customers engaged and more importantly, engaged and staying with E*TRADE. So that's really the -- the theory here is constant improvement. I don't think it's one thing that's going to roll out that's going to change the game, but there are multiple things that our product folks and our sales folks are helping us work through that are helpful for our customers interacting with us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Mewhirter with SunTrust.","Douglas Mewhirter","Two questions. First question, I just noticed in your statistics in your press release you had -- the attrition rate on your brokerage account, unless I'm reading it wrong, it seemed to tick up -- fairly significant tick up sequentially. I don't know if there is seasonality associated in the fourth quarter with higher customer churn or is that a sign that just the environment is just getting more competitive, especially with the -- seems to be pretty frothy trading activity from you and your competitors?","Karl Roessner","Yes, it's not so much the competitiveness. There are a lot of things that move through the attrition rate. It's affected also by activity that's coming from our stock plan business as customers in that area activate. We see a good bit of movement. It also is just an environment where you have a lot more interest in the market, so you see more accounts applications come in and then you see a bit more early-stage attrition. When we look through the data in terms of customers who are engaging with high quality relationships, we're very happy with the overall level of attrition that we see. It's really just the symptom of the market environment overall in terms of just the volatility that's driving to elevate the attrition a bit.","Douglas Mewhirter","My follow-up and my final question on the Corporate Services. You talked about your $14 billion pipeline, that's very encouraging. And from my end, I understand that is just the plan assets that aren't necessarily migrated and with the majority may not migrate after vesting because they want to buy a boat or a house or something. And you talked about your conversion rate a lot. So could you maybe talk about the current trend in that conversion rate from the pipeline to actual accounts? Is that improving or flat, declining? And is there anything in the works? I mean, you've talked about the TCA initiatives. Do you feel fairly confident that you could increase the conversation rate on that pipeline over the year or 2?","Karl Roessner","So yes, I wouldn't call it conversion rate, I'll call it retention rate of the asset that come in from that pipeline, right, that vest in the account or become exercisable and are exercised by the plan participant who then becomes an E*TRADE retail brokerage customer. So it's really providing that individual with the right suite of products or services because we can get in front of these customers a little bit sooner, a little bit earlier. So I am very confident in terms of the group of individuals and the product set that we now have available in our arsenal. And I think once we get TCA closed and get the right RIAs identified to put in front of some of these people, I think we can improve that retention rate from 15%. And if you started -- if you're staying at 15% of the assets that should come on us, increasing it by a percentage point or two is meaningful. So that's really what we're driving at. We've talked about this business for a very long time.","We just haven't been -- and I don't mean the stock plan business, I mean the retail brokerage account that results from the stock plan participant. And we just haven't been able to crack that code. And I think we finally have the set of products to see if we can make something happen here. Can we turn E*TRADE into something more than just the plan administrator and into that company that you want to interact with to talk about your finances. So that -- I mean, more to come and we'll absolutely continue to report on this go forward this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Harris","So when you guys are making decisions on either M&A or investment spend, how does the risk of further industry price cuts enter into your decision-making? Is it just setting higher ROIC targets for yourselves or is the -- sort of there's a little bit more nuance than that?","Michael Pizzi","Whenever we look at any acquisition, we stress test all of the variables. So we will stress and look at commission levels, we will stress and look at attrition rates, we'll stress and look at conversion issues or other items. We do a full risk analysis in terms of the profile of the acquisition and look really to see what we can achieve in terms of the ROIC and other metrics and base case accretion and how that accretion holds up under various outcomes. So it's a fairly robust framework that we look at once we evaluate these things. We think today's acquisition is going to provide great value.","Christopher Harris","Yes, and on the Cap One deal, what level of customer attrition are you guys assuming in your $0.06 accretion number?","Michael Pizzi","Yes, we modeled the attrition rate to be consistent with a transaction like this, which is essentially an account scrape. When a customer is moving from one platform and one brand to another platform and another brand, we model that overall with a fairly conservative assumption around that type of transaction and then continued attrition on essentially a closed block of accounts from there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.","Devin Ryan","Maybe one here just on retail engagement. Obviously, DARTs have been great and we've seen kind of the acceleration and engagement into January. And so maybe just want to dig in on that a little bit and whether you're seeing a widening out of the types of clients participating, just trying to think about is it more clients? Is it newer clients being more active? Is it just more Active Trading? So any perspective there would be helpful. And then just kind of a follow-up on that, was there any connection in December with the strong account openings to the Bitcoin futures launch?","Karl Roessner","So the first question, I would say that the -- all of the above. It hit on all -- hits on all cylinders at the present time. We are absolutely seeing first time entrants coming into the marketplace with new accounts and having account values that are a little lower than our average account sizes. So we absolutely have new accounts being opened by first-time participants. We can also see that in some of the call volumes and some of the questions that we receive. So absolutely, new participants. We are seeing a lot of engagement from our existing customers, particularly those more active traders, they become even more active. And then you see the margin book grow and sort of flex up as investor confidence continues. So it is really firing on all cylinders at the current time. I think as to the second part of the question, CBOE and CME products that we have out there, we've actually seen very limited uptake that we didn't launch those to our entire customer base, right? We just wouldn't do that. It's not safe for the customer, it's not safe for us. You really have to know what you're doing if you're going to engage in Bitcoin-related futures. ","We've built out the risk framework around it, we made sure we have the right margin requirements against it and we've talked to clients who are looking or are going into that product. From that set that we've opened it up to, we've still seen very limited trading activity and very limited engagement. Immaterial.","Devin Ryan","Okay, great. And just a follow-up here just quickly on the tax rate to 27%. It seems maybe a bit on the high-end, I know you're in kind of high tax states, but are there any things you can do to think about getting that down over time? Just trying to gauge maybe how conservative that is from a longer-term perspective. I'm assuming that does not include any other potential impacts from stock-based comp accounting or anything else like that.","Michael Pizzi","No. You'll still see volatility for the stock-based comp and then revaluation of state deferred tax assets based on apportionment each year. The 27% is really the 21% base. It's the addition of really the state levels, which are consistent really with the state levels prior. And then it's really the loss or the deduction for FDIC expense and executive comp, it sort of roles up to that overall level. Obviously, we will do our best to try and get the rate lower. But as sort of a domestic-based business in the business that we're in, it rolls up to 27% now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Campbell with Barclays.","Jeremy Campbell","I know you guys keep running the business as if it's going to be independent and the deals aren't -- haven't been that large, but now you have the 2Q TCA close, 3Q Cap One close, you guys kind of alluded to perhaps some more kind of opportunistic ways to deploy capital on the coming quarters. I guess with now, like, closing times getting closer and closer toward the end of next year, does M&A like this that seems maybe a bit more like nice financial transactions rather than bigger strategic augmentations, it all really reduces the board's opportunity and preclude foreign strategic alternatives like a sale?","Karl Roessner","So the easy answer to that one, and I'll give you a lot more than that, but the easy answer to that one is nothing would ever preclude the board's strategic optionality to make a decision to pursue strategic alternatives for this company. We have taken our board through these acquisitions. They are extremely supportive of the acquisitions. One of them was obviously a diversification of revenue play and gives us some tools to go after a segment of the marketplace that we just lose to because we don't have it, so we can't maintain those cash or those assets because they just leave us. So having a very simple and a somewhat attractive custody platform allows us to maintain some of those assets that otherwise trade away from us. ","When you look at what we did today, we've acquired a group or are in the process of acquiring a group of accounts that we think can be very valuable. Each of those transactions, if you take a look at the way that we've put them into the company and the way that they would be integrated would also be highly valuable to any shareholder who holds this company, whether it be the present group of shareholders or a new group through a transaction or other activity. Personally, and as a management team, we are extremely proud of what we've accomplished over the last 16 months in terms of what we've been able to deliver for our shareholders, both in terms of overall return and in terms of the company that we've grown in value quite significantly. We think both of these transactions are additive and they're absolutely not in any way preclusive of a board, me being on the board, making a decision that we should seek another strategy, another alternative, it's just not the case. So very pleased with where we are. I think these acquisitions are great for the company long-term regardless of who the holder of the company is. And we continue to strive toward our growth goals. Neither of these deals will be counted toward the completion of those growth goals nor will it be distracting to us completing those growth goals as I hope you guys have started to see. It's a pretty dedicated management team, pretty dedicated company and very focused on hitting what we laid out 16 months ago. So I think we're in a very good place. I like both of these deals, and I think, whoever the ultimate shareholders are of this company, they're all add into.","Operator","At this time, I will turn the call back over to Mr. Rosener for any concluding remarks.","Karl Roessner","Thank you all for joining us for the quarter. We look forward to talking to you in a couple of months, and have a good night.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."],"8106":["E*TRADE Financial's (NASDAQ:ETFC) Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call January 24, 2019  5:00 PM ET","Company Participants","Karl Roessner - Chief Executive Officer","Michael Pizzi - Chief Operating Officer","Chad Turner - Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Steven Chubak - Wolfe Research","Rich Repetto - Sandler O'Neill","Dan Fannon - Jefferies","Chris Harris - Wells Fargo","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Christian Bolu - Bernstein","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse","Will Nance - Goldman Sachs","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","Michael Cyprys - Morgan Stanley","Kyle Voigt - KBW","Operator","Good evening and thank you for joining E*TRADE's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Joining the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Karl Roessner; Chief Operating Officer, Michael Pizzi; and Chief Financial Officer, Chad Turner.","Today's call may include forward-looking statements, including statements about E*TRADE's future operational and financial performance, financial targets and growth expectations, strategic business initiatives, plans concerning capital deployment, and outlook on the broader economic environment, which reflect management's current estimates or beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.","During the call, the company will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures.

All of these documents are also available at about.etrade.com.","Note that the company has not reconciled its forward-looking non-GAAP measures, including non-GAAP adjusted operating margin, to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because material items that impact that measure are out of the company's control and cannot be reasonably predicted.","This call will present information as of December 31st, 2018 and January 24th, 2019. The company disclaims any duty to update forward-looking statements made during the call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available via phone and webcast later this evening at about.etrade.com. No other recordings or copies of this call are authorized or may be relied upon.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Roessner.","Karl Roessner","Thank you, Ash. Good evening and thank you for joining us today as we close the books on a very strong year. In 2018, we delivered for our customers adding new functionality for active traders, enhancing experiences on both our flagship website and mobile platforms, and building a more comprehensive value proposition for RIAs in our newly launched advisor channel, including through our new referral network.","In tandem, the team delivered a rock-solid service amid pronounced market volatility. These are the operating environments where our people and our model truly proved their mettle as we delivered a record year for trading activity, net new accounts, net new assets, and customer margin balances, which all contributed to our highest annual revenue and operating margin ever. Accomplishments that served as the backdrop for us to return more than $1 billion to our shareholders via stock buybacks and our first ever quarterly dividend.","In order to best tee up where we're going in 2019, I'll start with the recap of where we've been and what we've accomplished this past year. As noted our customers were remarkably engaged over the past 12 months generating a record 282,000 DARTs in 2018, up more than 30% from 2017.","Beyond shattering last year's record, each month of the year was stronger than any month before 2018. For the fourth quarter, we posted DARTs of 296,000, second-only to the first quarter of this past year.","In addition, we drove continued growth in derivatives engagement with overall derivative DARTs increasing 34% versus the year-ago quarter and the number of accounts trading derivatives growing by 11% over the same period.","We expect the derivative mix to continue to improve as we leverage the E*TRADE brand to attract option traders to our Power E*TRADE platform, which continues to expand its roster of intuitive and powerful capabilities. Account and asset growth were also strong in 2018. Excluding acquisitions, we generated $15.2 billion in net new assets and 204,000 net new brokerage accounts both company records.","We see significant opportunity for growth in 2019 through our exceptional trading offering, our growing investment offerings, and access to wealth management solutions both digital and off-line, spanning core portfolios, our highly rated Robo Advisors, and our institutional custody platform E*TRADE Advisor Services, positioning us to increase retention and drive deeper engagement with our existing customers.","While customer margin balances declined from Q3's record levels, they still finish the year strong at $9.6 billion, up 5% from last year. For the full year, the average margin balances of $10.4 billion is up 35% from the full year 2017 average.","We also materially expanded our capabilities through the launch of our new E*TRADE Advisor Services channel. The addition of advisory capability serves as a critical vehicle for growth and retention as we can provide our retail clients access to solutions for complex wealth management services that extend beyond our traditional self-directed offering.","Furthermore, with the purchase of nearly 1 million brokerage accounts from Capital One in November, we now have close to 7 million accounts across self-directed brokerage, advisory, stock plan administration and banking, representing significant scale across our breadth of offerings.","Our substantial customer and asset base means that even modest penetration into our emerging wealth business from our existing customer base provides ample opportunity for growth. Of particular note in this endeavor is the launch of our E*TRADE Advisor Network, which leverages our distribution channels to link customers desiring an advice solutions with the most well suited registered investment advisor.","Edelman Financial and Mercer Advisors are charter members of the national program and we are also very excited about bringing on other well-known advisors on to the platform that we are in the process of on-boarding. We're optimistic that we can expand the share of business our clients conduct with us as well as attract new clients and RIAs to our E*TRADE Advisor Services platform.","While it\u2019s early days, the demand from RIAs to participate in the program has been strong and the feedback from the field has been encouraging with six of our branches now in the program and a growing pipeline of referred assets.","On the digital wealth front, we attracted solid flows to our managed products during the year and earned top marks from Barron's in its inaugural ranking of Robo Advisors, outclassing some significantly larger incumbents.","We also made three marquee additions to our offerings. First, we greatly expanded our roster of commission free ETFs and no load, no transaction fee mutual funds to more than 250 and 4,400 respectively, including the addition of Vanguard. This expansion enables our customers to invest every penny into their future while creating truly diversified long-term portfolios.","Second, we launched pre-built portfolios, our incredibly intuitive service that enables self-directed investors to choose from a bundle of ETF or mutual fund portfolios mapped to risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment management style allowing customers to get invested in just a few clicks.","And third, we launched thematic investing features providing customers with portfolios of select ETFs that invest in companies and industries aligned with their values and interests. Our newest themes include artificial intelligence, gender diversity, and self-driving cars.","Turning to Corporate Services, this was a groundbreaking year, in which we enjoyed a more than sevenfold increase from 2017's net account additions. During the year, we put a significant amount of time and effort into further solidifying our role as a leader in this space with an unrivaled digital offering and a world-class service and support team.","Enhancements introduced this year include a revamped planning center that helps participants easily factor stock plan benefits into the context of an overall financial strategy; the addition of a peer tracker tool enabling participants to monitor their performance awards and benchmark them against similar employers; and automated 10b5-1 processing, which streamlines the setup, maintenance, and reporting of trading plans for participants and administrators alike.","We implemented a record shattering $23 billion from new stock plan relationships in 2018, just shy of the $25 billion implemented during the four prior years combined. And with a robust $5 billion of pending implementations in the pipeline, we continue to feel great about the growth trajectory of this channel.","Within the context of our enhanced trading, investing, and new advisory capabilities, we aim to better engage with stock plan participants who will continue to play a key role in our future growth.","Further, we spoke earlier about the opportunity from our adviser network and there's perhaps no more fertile ground for referrals than our Corporate Services channel.","In all, 2018 presented tremendous opportunity, but what truly stands out to me is how our team executed, allowing us to easily surpass historical performance records, while delivering E*TRADE's strongest financial performance ever. The team's performance enabled us to generate and return significant capital to our shareholders over the course of the year.","During the fourth quarter alone, we repurchased slightly north of $500 million worth of stock as we opportunistically accelerated repurchase volume amid a depressed valuation, bringing our total buybacks for the year to $1.1 billion. We also declared and paid our first ever quarterly common dividend of $0.14 per share in November, which we believe added a positive new dimension to our investor value proposition.","And so with an extremely productive year behind us, our strategy will tap into the tremendous growth platform we have installed, defined by deep operational know-how, a robust tech prowess and an unrivaled brand. We aim to once again flex our muscles and deliver on the following.","First, we will maintain our position as the undisputed home for active and derivative traders. We have done much to build our position over the past two years, but we will not rest on past successes. This is a crucial customer set that we will continue to surprise and delight through outstanding service and further enhancements to our best-in-class offerings.","Second, we will expand our holistic digital wealth management offering. As we continue to find new ways to deepen our engagement with customers, we are also focused on new and emerging investors. Expect more from us in this space in 2019 and beyond.","Third, we will capitalize on our B2B channels with leading technology solutions, E*TRADE Corporate Services, where we already lead the industry in market share and in customer satisfaction; and E*TRADE Advisor Services, where we are entering the custody space with the leading technology solution, a value brand that RIAs want to be attached to and a vast population of accounts and assets that leading advisers can tap into through our new referral program.","Finally, a note on the management realignment we announced late in the year aimed at positioning the company to achieve these goals.","As Chief Operating Officer, Mike Pizzi's role has expanded beyond finance to include technology and operations. These functions are instrumental to the success of our strategy, and I'm excited to have Mike unify the visions of these organizations with an eye toward continuous process improvement, efficient delivery and a laser focus on execution. Mike has proven time and again that he is the type of leader who can get jobs like these done.","As it relates to the finance organization, we are fortunate to have a deep bench of seasoned professionals and are pleased to tap Chad Turner as our new CFO. Chad has been the man behind much of what investors see and analyze, and will now take a prominent role on the main stage. As the former Head of FP&A, he has been a key player in the development of our strategic and capital plans and served as the bridge between the business and finance, and I'm very excited for you all to get to know him.","To close on my section, it was yet another busy year for our firm, during which we continue to demonstrate our ability to grow our business to the benefit of our shareholders, and 2019 is poised to continue that trend. I look forward to showing you all the team has in store.","With that, I will turn it over to our Chief Operating Officer, Mike Pizzi.","Michael Pizzi","Thanks, Karl.","Before introducing Chad to walk through our financial results, I would like to address three topics. One, our capital deployment during the quarter and beyond; two, our sensitivity to interest rates and our investment portfolio strategy; and three, our progress towards our long-term EPS goal.","On capital deployment, as Karl highlighted, we were opportunistic in share repurchases during the quarter, retiring 10 million shares or 4% of the outstanding balance. We plan to complete the authorization at a measured pace through 2019 with the caveat that we have the flexibility to manage our balance sheet size and capital position through our sweep deposit program, which could enable us to accelerate share repurchases, if financially compelling to do so.","As a reminder, our sweep deposit program allows us to move customer deposits to third-party banks in a matter totally seamless to our customers. This program accomplishes two goals: one, it gives us flexibility on our balance sheet size; and two, it expands the level of insurance protection for our customers. The rate we earn on these deposits is closely tied to short-term rates.","As short-term rates increase and longer-term rates decrease, it may become more compelling to direct deposits off-balance sheet and accelerate or increase buybacks with the freed up capital from a smaller balance sheet. Our stock valuation is obviously an important component of this calculus as well.","Today, we continue to direct capital to balance sheet growth, but I wanted to highlight the tactical flexibilities that exist should the yield curve flatten further or invert, or evaluation becomes even more compelling.","The fourth quarter provided a notable shift in the yield curve as it flattened by the greatest amount since 2011. The spread between 10 year treasuries and three month LIBOR compressed by nearly 80 basis points with short-term rates rising 40 basis points, while long-term rates fell by roughly the same amount.","As you are aware, we structure our investments to match the average duration of our liabilities, which remains around three to four years. But with the balance sheet exposure across the curve and off-balance sheet income tied to short rates, moves like the ones experienced in Q4 do not impact our earnings profile in a material way.","To better help investors model this dynamic, we included a new table on page 18 of the investor deck, summarizing sensitivities to net revenue from movements across the curve. With regard to portfolio strategy, in 2017, our board asked us to review the risk-reward trade-off of expanding beyond our agency-only investment mandate.","Following an exhaustive review, we concluded that it will be prudent to build out the capabilities to make investments in the highest rated, most senior classes in the asset-backed market.","Over 2019, we intend to begin making purchases of investment securities that do not carry an agency guaranty, with the ability to build up to 4% of our interest-earning assets over the course of the year. This market offers a spectrum of maturity profiles, which allows us a broader tool set in managing our interest rate risk, leading to a more optimal portfolio structure that we believe will generate excess returns without changing our risk profile.","As to the progress on our long-term EPS goal of greater than $7 by 2023, we are only one quarter in, but squarely on track and confident in our ability to deliver on this goal. As we mentioned, when we communicated this goal last quarter, our modeled assumptions have been stressed to contemplate a variety of market and industry pressures. So even with the recent flattening of the curve and the removal of any future fed rate hikes from our forecast, we are not hindered in our ability to achieve our targets.","As for other financial commitments during the fourth quarter, we posted a 48% adjusted operating margin, on track to reach 50% in 2020 and the mid-50s by 2023. We paid nearly $540 million to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks, well above our 80% to 90% payout target due to the accelerated repurchase activity. And we generated an adjusted return on equity of 18%, on pace to exceed 20% by 2023.","In summary, we are right on track across each of the objectives we laid out last quarter and continue to see tremendous long-term shareholder value creation with the execution of our plan.","Now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Chad Turner, to review our financial results for the quarter.","Chad Turner","Thanks, Mike. It's a pleasure to speak with you all. For the quarter, we reported net income of $270 million or $1.06 per share on revenues of $735 million, up $98 million from the year-ago quarter. Included in the quarter was a $12 million or $0.03 per share benefit for provision for loan losses.","As for quarter results, net interest income increased by $16 million sequentially as our net interest margin expanded by 10 basis points on flat average asset balances. The key drivers of the improved NIM were a 17 basis point expansion of the gross yield on invested assets offset by a 7 basis point greater cost of funds.","Average interest-earning assets were $60.1 billion, which included the partial period impact of the November on-boarding of $1.6 billion in sweep deposits from the Capital One account acquisition. This was partially offset by strong customer net buying for the majority of the quarter, which I'll expand on in a moment.","Our blended deposit rate rose from 18 basis points to 25 basis points, reflective of our October increase. While I note that we did not amend our average highest rates following the December fed hike, we continue to monitor the competitive landscape and we'll adjust cash rates if warranted.","We modeled deposit betas at around 20% on brokerage deposits over the long-term, but the blended deposit rate may exceed that as our premium savings product grows. For Q1 2019, we expect the blended deposit rate, including customer payables, to be around 30 basis points.","Our average reinvestment rate in the securities portfolio remains 300 basis points to 325 basis points, consistent with last quarter. We maintained this range despite the decline in long-term rates as asset spreads have widened and short-term rates have increased, making shorter maturities more attractive.","For the full year 2019, we expect to generate a net interest margin of around 320 basis points, which assumes customer margin balances hold at their current levels and the fed funds rate does not increase over the course of the year.","With respect to balance sheet size, the most prominent driver will continue to be customer activity, whether it'd be a new flows to the firm, proceeds from stock plan transactions, or net buying or selling activity across our retail and adviser services accounts.","Q4 represented our eighth consecutive quarter of customer net buying, capping off a year in which our customers deployed a record $13.6 billion towards market opportunities. During the quarter, our customers were net buyers of $1.6 billion, despite $1.7 billion of net selling during the last few days of December. This drove our period end cash and equivalents to be roughly $1.7 billion higher than the quarter's average as the late influx was not invested due to timing.","As you'd expect, the same dynamic drew down the period-end margin balance versus the Q4 average. January to date, customer cash and margin have held fairly steady with year-end balances. Commission revenue of $123 million was up $14 million year-over-year and $6 million sequentially as DARTs of 296,000 improved 11% from Q3 levels. DARTs have moderated slightly to start 2019 with \u2013 January to date tracking down around 5% from Q4 levels.","Commission per trade declined to $6.66 in Q4. As equity trade mix expanded, trade from our most active customers increased disproportionately and stock plan trades moderated on seasonal factors and depressed valuation on participant shares.","For 2019, we expect CPT to range from $6.60 to $7, where equity volumes and derivative mix will play a key factor on where we fall within the range. Several seasonal factors, particularly surrounding stock plan trades, can also lead to quarterly variability in this metric.","Going forward, we expect levels to stabilize within this range. Our forecast do not include any reductions to advertised commission rates, but our long-term plan does assume some pressure from preferred pricing on our most valuable accounts. Fees and service charges were flat with the prior quarter as increased order flow revenue on higher DARTs was offset by a reduction in FX revenue driven by lower corporate services activity.","The average yield on third-party cash, which includes off-balance sheet sweeps and money funds, was up 5 basis points to 148 basis points. We anticipate earning around 165 basis points on third-party cash in Q1 as we benefit from recent moves in short-term rates. Gains on securities were $11 million, and we expect to realize around $10 million per quarter going forward.","Moving to expenses. Non-interest expense was $382 million, slightly up from the prior quarter. This quarter's adjusted operating margin of 48% which excludes provision benefit remained relatively flat to the prior quarter.","Total marketing expense of $48 million brings our total spend for the year to $200 million, in line with our expectations. We believe our full year marketing investment is appropriate for the current environment and expect to carry it through 2019 with the understanding that we can tactically ramp it up or down based on market conditions.","Compensation and benefits were $152 million, down $5 million from last quarter on a slight downtick in headcount as well as seasonal declines in payroll taxes and vacation accruals. Also worth noting was the reduction in FDIC premiums, due to the elimination of the surcharge implemented in 2016. This improved our FDIC line by approximately $4 million leaving Q4 with a good run rate to model going forward.","For the full year, our adjust -- our operating margin was 47%, adjusting for provision benefit and losses on early extinguishment of debt. For 2019, we anticipate generating an adjusted operating margin of around 48%, which assumes no fed rate hikes for 2019.","As Mike mentioned, even if the fed keeps its target rates unchanged over the next five years, we remain confident in achieving a 50% operating margin in 2020 and reaching the mid-50s level by 2023.","As for corporate cash, we finished the quarter at $391 million, reflecting approximately $380 million in distributions from the bank and broker, less $0.5 billion we used to repurchase of our stock, and $36 million to pay our common dividend.","As a reminder, we target holding a minimum of $300 million in corporate cash. Additionally, we anticipate receiving $250 million in distributions from the bank and broker in Q1.","Lastly, our effective tax rate in the quarter was 26%, which included a benefit from the revaluation of state deferred tax assets. We expect the full year tax rate for 2019 to be around 27% noting that it can vary quarter-to-quarter.","In closing, 2018 and Q4 produced strong results including a host of records for E*TRADE and we are keeping our foot firmly on the gas in 2019. On a personal note, I look forward to speaking with you all in the year ahead.","And with that, we will open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with the Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Steven Chubak","Hi, good evening.","Karl Roessner","Hi, Steven.","Steven Chubak","So I wanted to start things off with a question on the earnings lock. And when you laid this out last year, you noted there was a clear path to achieving that $7 earnings number both in good and bad equity market types, higher cash levels, weaker equity market type, essentially offsetting pressures from declining margin balances, et cetera.","And this quarter was really supposed to be a good litmus test for that where in a tough equity market environment, you were supposed to see that uptick in cash levels and really that resiliency that didn\u2019t show through. We actually saw it a bit more at peers, I would say in their results relative to yours. I was hoping you could speak to maybe some of the differences in terms of mix that might have impacted that? And I guess just taking a step back, what gives you confidence that, that $7 earnings number is still achievable given the absence of that resiliency in the quarter?","Karl Roessner","Thanks, Steven. It's a good question and we've obviously spent some time taking a look through the results. What we have is when you look at what actually went on in December, even though the last few days had significant and I mean, significant amounts of net selling and the volatility that took place. We still had an overall quarter of net buying, right. Our fourth quarter of net buying, we had record net buying all year long.","So you did see the margin balance come down. So, I think we ended at about $9.6 billion and you saw a lot of trading activity, a lot of volatility that took place in the market. So, in terms of what we've always said on the cash balances is there is a period of time before you start to see some of that real growth come in.","So, what we experienced was a quarter of net buying by our customers, and what you need to see and what we fully anticipate and still believe in the model, obviously, that we\u2019ll put forth is growth in cash that comes through from whether it be net selling activity, corporate stock plan activity, interest dividends, new cash coming on board, or cash coming out of the marketplace, that's not necessarily a three, four, five-week swing for us, right. I think what we've always said there is sort of a period during which it'll match up, but it's not necessarily within period that you'll see that catch-up.","So, we're still fully behind the model. And I think the certainty that comes around that if you look at the new lock that we put in, we've actually taken the two interest rate hikes out of the model without any adjustments to either operating margin or the $7 target.","So, we think the model will hold up very well and we think that we'll still be in a very good place. So, quite happy with the results for the year and quite happy with where we're headed in 2019.","Steven Chubak","And Karl, just one follow-up from me on some of your near-term margin goals. I believe the operating margin target that you've outlined 50% by 2020; it does contemplate some level of revenue growth. Just given some of the macro risks, heightened late cycle fears that we're seeing, if the revenue environment weakens, how should we think about the expense flexibility you guys can demonstrate in a more challenging environment?","And are you confident that you can still meet your margin targets even if the revenue environment is flattish and maybe even declining a little bit as the rate outlook weakens and maybe the cash growth is a little bit more muted than you might have anticipated. ","Karl Roessner","Sure. I don't think the cash growth will be a little bit more muted but I do understand the question that\u2019s coming through. So, what I would say is we are extremely confident. You never want to say prior performance as an indication of future results, but I think what you have here is a management team and a company that is extremely disciplined around expenses.","And if we see that there is a dislocation or that there's challenging fronts on the revenue side, we will absolutely tighten the belt and throttle back where we need to and make the cuts that we need to.","A lot of what we're doing and a lot of what we've done with Mike Pizzi's role around technology and operations and what we're looking out on the business is driving efficiency through the implementation of technology operational excellence.","So that is something that we are absolutely honed in on and laser-focused on, and we think that will raise great benefits for us going forward particularly as we bring our advisory network online as we bring more and more challenging pressures into our call centers into our operations capability, I think we're in a very good spot Steven. So, we're absolutely focused on it and stand behind the operating margin and that's something that we are not going to walk back absent some extreme events.","Steven Chubak","Okay. And just one final one for me on yield and maybe the NIM outlook. You spoke of increasing your exposure to asset-backed securities. In the current environment, I would say that there is significant investor sensitivity; the banks adding credit risk in their securities portfolios, even if it is AAA, AA-rated CLO securities, for example. How much of a yield pickup do you anticipate from remixing that 4% of earning assets? And how do you get comfortable with that 4% level?","And the last thing I just wanted to attack on is on the margin balance side, does the guidance of 320 basis points contemplate end-of-period margin balances or is that average for the quarter?","Karl Roessner","So, I'm going to ask Mike Pizzi to take sort of the technical piece on where we are from looking at these types of securities. What I would say is as Mike said in his prepared remarks; we started looking at this back in 2017. And as I think you'll know, Steven, and what I think we've shown the Street time and again, is that we are extremely disciplined in terms of using our shareholders' capital or deploying that capital in any way that does not drive value for our shareholders in the end run.","So, I think with that, I'll ask Mike to add some color around what we're thinking about, what we're doing, potential impacts and then the remainder of your question.","Michael Pizzi","Sure. Steven, we spent quite a bit of time over 2018 studying the market, building out extensive capabilities to model and stress various security types. We looked extensively at sort of various shock scenarios that will be similar to the Federal Reserve's severe adverse scenario on the types of securities. And we put together a high degree of exacting standards that we believe that what we would be targeting has no potential really for credit losses under the most serious of scenarios.","Why do we want to do this? When we think about a portfolio that's sort of mandated in only the agency market, you're really inviting yourself to security types that all exhibit some degree or another negative convexity or high duration. Under a flattering curve, with the ability to add various type of positively convexed securities at various maturities gives us the ability to construct a portfolio that is just entirely more optimal without really taking any additional dimension of risk.","You specifically mentioned CLOs in your question. Those are not really in the types of securities that we're looking at. We're really looking at very high quality credit card issuers, the highest quality prime auto issuers and the best possible commercial mortgage backs that have very, very high degree of enhancements and perform extremely well under the most severe shocks.","When we looked at this, we don't see this as a material extension of credit risk in the portfolio, and it gives us significant degrees of freedom in terms of portfolio construction and management of our interest rate risk.","ChadTurner","And as for your question on margin, Steven, this is Chad. Consistent with how we've guided in prior calls, we just hold margin constant to give you that NIM outlook of 320.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","RichRepetto","Yes good evening guys.","KarlRoessner","Hi Rich.","RichRepetto","Good evening, Karl. I guess my question is on -- with the backdrop of the $7 in 2023, and I'm assuming that takes significant balance sheet growth to get there, so anyway, the first part of the question is on capital. With Tier 1 at 6.6% at the parent, I guess, how are we going to grow the balance sheet without -- in the prepared remarks, you talked about, I thought, pretty much maintaining the buyback. But I'm just trying to understand, where is this capital going to come to fund significant buyback. And let's just cut back, and the balance sheet growth, if I have it right, that gets you to on that path to $7 in '23.","Michael Pizzi","Yes, Rich, I mean, it's a similar dynamic to past periods in the buyback where we've got sort of essentially the earnings power of both the bank and the broker-dealer that are quickly and are essentially generating dividends up to the parent. That free cash flow is used from that earnings stream to fund the buyback program. What you see in this quarter is really just an acceleration of the prior buybacks we had, the 500 that we completed, driving the ratio down a little bit. But the earnings power is clearly there and continue the buyback program at a measured pace over 2019 and still leave enough capital in the bank to allow for balance sheet growth to drive towards the $7.","RichRepetto","Okay. So the buyback will moderate from this level than the level in the prior quarter?","Michael Pizzi","I mean, 500 million in a single quarter is over the earnings in the quarter. So we can't continue. We would go -- we would drop precipitously in capital. So we will slow it down now and continue at a more measured pace to complete the authorization over 2019.","RichRepetto","Okay. So my follow-up would be on the corporate stock plan business, a great business for you all. And I know that, that is a good -- a big driver of the $7 and getting the cash to get there.","So in this past quarter, I think it was a unique quarter, but we did see, if we're doing our math right, 20% drop in the corporate stock plan assets. So I guess, can you talk about the cash contribution that you get from it?","I guess we can assume that this is technology companies and the balances are going to be pretty volatile depending on the market conditions. I think that's what happened this quarter. But anyway the question is, how much cash do the corporate stock plan business actually contribute?","Karl Roessner","I mean, so Rich, you're exactly right, right. We are absolutely in a big way in technology and in healthcare. Those are extremely volatile markets and extremely volatile places to be. So we did see a precipitous drop in the number of assets that the corporate service plans hold, right. If their stock came down, that's what we'd see.","It doesn't necessarily impact the flow of dividend or other sort of cash coming through those accounts. What it did do was slowdown the sales by stock plan participants. These are not going to sell at those depressed levels if they don't have to, right.","So that's what we've seen in terms of the dynamic of stock plan this past quarter. That also had an impact on CPT when you read it through and see how that piece came down. When you lose that additional upside from some of the stock plan trades, that has another drag down on CPT. So a lot of different factors. Mike or Chad, I don't know if you guys want to add in on anything on the cash side?","Chad Turner","Yes, on the cash side, cash is relatively flat quarter-over-quarter as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. I'd say their contribution was relatively consistent as far as the percent of the total of what it's been. It didn't have really any impacts in the quarter, so it's consistent with what we've talked about last quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open please go ahead.","Dan Fannon","I guess a bit more short term, but I guess the comments around January and margin balance is kind of staying flat, I guess, can you talk about the engagement here the start of the year and how it might have differed than what you saw last year? And then we've heard from some of your peers that margin balances began to rise, and I think you said they're still at end-of-period type levels?","Karl Roessner","Yes. No, they're definitively still at end-of-period type levels. We have seen some engagement, but it's off about sort of 5% from year-end DART volumes. So margin to us, and as we always talk about, it's really the indicator or the lead indicator of investor confidence in the marketplace. So that balance on our side has been up a little bit, but not at any meaningful way since the beginning of the year.","Dan Fannon","Okay. And then just to follow up on some of the expenses. Can you clarify your marketing guidance for 2019? I think you mentioned maintaining these levels. So is that flat year-over-year? I guess how should we think about marketing on a year-over-year basis?","Chad Turner","That's correct. My prepared remarks were flat at the $200 million like we had for 2018.","Dan Fannon","Okay. Thank you.","Karl Roessner","But Dan, just to be very clear, what we said and what I said in a couple of the responses. That's an area that should we see -- should we not be getting the returns that we want for the marketing dollars we'll spend -- we're spending, we'll either deploy it somewhere else or we'll throttle back and make the adjustments as the markets change, right?","We have a very skilled and quite powerful marketing department. They know what they're doing with that cash and they know how to deploy it the right way. So in markets like these, you start taking a look at what's the brand advertising returning for us, what are we getting from some of the cash promos and some of the other things that we do. So, that's the analysis that we go through on a regular basis here. So yes, holding it flat for budgetary purposes, but that's absolutely a lever for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Chris Harris","Thanks. Hey, guys. My question's on advisory services. Thanks for the color earlier. Wondering if you guys could expand a little bit more and talk to us a bit about the backlog, how many potential firms are in the backlog in advisory services, how much of potential assets could there be and then bigger picture-type question, what are the economics as part of the business versus your retail business?","Karl Roessner","Look, in terms of the advisory services business, just bearing in mind the reason that we really went after this in the first instance was we had a bit of a hole in our offering and that showed particularly strongly when you look at our stock plan participant population, right. So making sure that when those individuals come into cash or come into money for the first time or wealth for the first time, if it's going out to an adviser, that's just another way with our new custodian platform for us to hold on to some of those assets and really develop a relationship with that customer. So that, first and foremost, let's keep in mind that, that was one of the reasons we went out for this.","In terms of backlog, we've been extremely impressed with the way the business has performed, the way the brand has supported the business and really drawn interest from the RIA marketplace in general. We stated in prepared remarks, the two big ones on our National Referral Program that we've literally just started the pilot for are Edelman and Mercer, right. So those are two names that folks around the country know. They do quite a nice job of branding. They also do quite a nice job of taking care of individual's finances. So very happy to be partnering with them.","In terms of the pipeline, when we talked about it in some of the prepared remarks and at some of the other conferences and on the call, we had $12 billion signed up that we believe committed for the next two years. We've onboarded about $1 billion-plus since we started. So call it $13 billion-plus since we got started that we anticipate being on the platform over the next two years. This is very, very early days and this is the type of response that we've had. So couldn't be more pleased.","In terms of economics, there are two different models, if you will. On the referral network side, there are three separate fee streams. One is the custodian fee that we receive for custodying the assets on our E*TRADE Advisory Services platform known as Liberty. The second fee stream on the custodial side or the arrangement side is the cash, right, the cash balance that's held in the accounts. That cash behaves a little bit differently on the Investment Advisory side. So we have a team of individuals on our treasury who deals with that and invests it. Similar way to what we have, a little shorter duration.","And then the third stream is the referral fee that we get paid by the RIA to whom those assets transfer to, right. So they are sort of a three-pronged approach on our referral side. On the generally custody side, it's just custody fee and the amount that we make on the cash. In terms of our overall plan and the way that this lays out for our overall -- the five-year plan. The way I look at it and the way the finance team and our management team looks at it, there is a lot of upside in the advisory business. We didn't bake in any heroic assumptions and there's not a heck of a lot of this fee stream built into the plan. That plan was really driven by our core business and our stock plan administration business.","Chris Harris","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Devin Ryan","Great. Good afternoon, guys.","Karl Roessner","Hey, Devin.","Devin Ryan","Just a question here on Mike's comments earlier around being able to kind of toggle cash seamlessly over to the third-party banks to free up capital potentially for purchases. I just want to make sure I'm understanding this. Is there any reason to do it now? It would seem to be kind of dilutive to the near-term. I just want to make sure I'm not missing something. Or if this is just more an opportunity in a severe rate scenario where the curve is inverted?","Chad Turner","Yes. Sure. I mean, I think if you think about it now, we are still earning with the sort of marginal reinvestment rate in that sort of 300 to 325 basis point range. Enough spread on deploying the balance sheet to you to earn the right return on capital relative to the cost of capital. If the short-term rates continue to rise and we see sort of a continuation of the trends that we saw kind of emerge a bit in December and sort of the reinvestment rate falls lower, the short-term rate continues to increase, we have the ability then to really begin to start to sort of push those deposits off-balance sheet, free up that excess capital and then deploy that capital or return that capital to the shareholder because we're going to be earning the rate.","At the spreads today, it's there it's still the right decision to proceed with the balance sheet. But the flatness to the curve is, I think you have to factor in sort of the relative \u2013 those sort of \u2013 it's a \u2013 in the current period, you're right. It would be sort of immediately dilutive, but if you look at sort of the longer-term periods. You get varying outcomes from that as revenue growth continues on the smaller share count.","So looking at all of that, I would say that it's fairly close, but it's still the best decision to continue with the growth of the balance sheet overall. But the yield curve and valuation play directly into that.","Devin Ryan","Yes. Okay. Got it. Helpful. And then just follow up here \u2013 still just want to dig in a little bit more on the customer cash change in the quarter. And I hear the comment on customer buying, but in December specifically, still just a little bit surprised relative to what we've seen from some peers. And so I'm \u2013 can you kind of maybe dig into that whether it's really just a mix difference and I guess, why you think that? And then, did you see any kind of movement into, as people came out of the market, margin balances declined, that cash, rather than going into the bank, you went into a money market or some other cash alternative?","Karl Roessner","So just as to take the last part first, we didn't see that behavior at all in terms of moving to the sidelines in cash from straight from the margin book or coming out. We have had some nice growth in our \u2013 the higher interest rate savings product that we have. But that's coming from lots of different sources. We haven't seen the cannibalization or other things that the folks often talk about. So I think that instrument is doing exactly what it needs to do and forming the relationships that we'd like to see.","So in terms of the business mix or other pieces, I don't talk about our competitor's business or try and get into what they do, but their models are very different and we did see activity on a very small scale obviously on the E*TRADE advisory services side that will lead us to believe that many of the RIAs in the space were moving to cash, that is not big enough to move the needle on our balance sheet or on our books in any meaningful way yet.","Someday it will be, but not today. So I do think you have a bit of mix play there where we have more of a focus and a heavier concentration of active traders who were either pulling out or sort of getting into situations that were upside down on the margin \u2013 on the margin side, that's more of what we saw, Devin. So I didn't see any of the other behaviors you were talking about. So yes, business mix definitely had something to do with it, if you're judging us peer-to-peer.","Chad Turner","Yes, and Devin, I will just add to that. On the quarter, we're still at $1.6 billion of net bulk -- customer net buying. That was a much stronger number coming into December. We did switch to a bit of net selling very late in the period. And of course, that volatility, that selling occurred right up to the record date that we have here.","It's a little bit just short-term to look at cash dynamics this quickly. We are still confident in the dynamics that we outlined really on the call last time and really, what we've been outlining as we sort of has been out on the road.","And that's that the cash growth comes over time as customers build sort of account value from dividends and interest. We see customers just not sort of reinvesting as quickly. The corporate services proceeds that we've outlined, the size and growth of that business still remains a very compelling cash generator. Nothing has really changed, except the value of some of the underlying companies have gone down.","And as Karl already highlighted, we are a bit technology-centric there, so it's a little bit higher beta overall. But we still see that business building, we still see cash coming from that, we still see the advisory channel driving cash growth over time. So, all of that leads us to a high degree of confidence in the long-term outlook.","And you could even see -- what's happened here is we've backed out two interest rate hikes relative to the last guidance and essentially are affirming the long-term outcome. We think we are very much on track and have faith that, that is going to -- that we are going to continue along plan.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","Hi. Thanks, guys. Just a quick one. Just on the interest-earning assets, when you think -- obviously, a lot going on in the quarter. But when I think about 2019, and the environment where you say you exceed kind of the expectations on growth, do you think it's primarily being driven by the clients not being so aggressive on in terms of net buying? Or are there other initiatives that you guys have in place that could accelerate through 2019, whether it's in the corporate side, the advisory, or the core business that could grow those balances?","Chad Turner","Hey, Michael, this is Chad. So I'd point you to the long-term earnings size as start. And we laid out the assumptions there on what we believe around where that growth comes from, and you can attribute that to the interest-earning assets for 2019. Obviously, that's a five-year view, but certainly that lays out a bit of our belief as it relates to 2019.","Additionally, I would point back to Karl's comments on the growth in the business. You could think about the pipeline for corporate services as well as the adviser channel and then just to the overall wealth management product add that we're doing and what's that's going to grow in the business. And that long-term earning slide gives you a good view of where we think that growth is going to come from. So I would use that as the best proxy for it.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Karl Roessner","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick one on deposit costs. I believe you indicated that you expect the deposit cost to continue to move higher to 30 basis points in 1Q. I'm assuming that that's just a flow-through from December hike, but wanted to confirm that? And ask, if we end up in an environment where short-term rates are not going to actually end up moving higher, what do you think about the likelihood of deposit cost continuing to move up, how should we think about that?","Chad Turner","The 30 basis points I mentioned -- I mentioned earlier. Yes, that's the move from December reading through and just kind of the average coming in from Q4, there's no other -- that doesn't contemplate any other material moves in rates from that perspective.","As it relates to overall long term, the 20% beta over the long term that I quoted, I will use that as a proxy. So while in any given period, it maybe ebb and flow a bit. We definitely use that 20% beta as a proxy over the long-term interest rate cycle.","Karl Roessner","And Brennan, the other thing that we obviously always keep an eye on is the competitive set, right, to make sure that we're in line with some of our peers and we listen to our customers and what they want and need in those accounts and that's just another thing we keep eye on.","Brennan Hawken","Yes. Right. So I guess, the gist to my question, understanding the beta sort of requires the move in the short-term rates and the competitive dynamic is the other piece of that. When we think about prior cycles, it's my understanding that you sometimes have seen the competitive dynamics lead to continued upward pressure on deposit cost even once short-term rate hikes have sort of played out.","Should we think that, that might end up being a risk? Obviously, it's going to depend on how the competitive dynamics work out, but is that fair to say, we've seen that in past cycles?","Karl Roessner","I think the only piece that makes sense is the one you just threw out there, right, which is what do competitive forces sort of put us in a position to do. We're not going to -- I mean, just keep in mind that this is still cash that we're very aware of and have done -- have lots of analysis and data around the duration.","How this cash is used in terms of investing, the percentage of cash that's in the customer accounts. What it means for that customer, what they're really looking to do with that money is be on the sideline and wait to invest at the right time or go transact at the right time. So I think, the only other piece to that, if rates are not moving up, is really the competitive dynamic.","Michael Pizzi","Yes, and Brennan, I would just add to that, that we have a range of products and various products for customers that we tailor to that earn that deposit profile. Specifically, the premium savings product for the customer that's really just looking to be out of the market, we don't want that money leaving.","If they're just going to be sitting on cash for a long period of time, we make savings products available to them. We have certain negotiated tiers for sort of very large customers who are sensitive to that.","We have the right set of products to sort of position against the customer base. So unless there is continued significant pressure in the competitive environment, if we don't see rates moving \u2013 if rates moving higher, I think you can say that, we're going to try to do the best we can to sort of maintain that deposit cost.","Chad Turner","And Brennan, just to add a final note, I would just say that all of what Mike and Karl mentioned, it's all contemplated in the 30 basis points that we quoted.","Brennan Hawken","Thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Bernstein. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Christian Bolu","Hello guys. A quick one for me. Mike, I guess, early days in your role as COO, but as you look at the technology and operational architecture of the firm, curious where you see the most opportunity for improvement or growth?","Michael Pizzi","Yes, I mean, look, we have started -- I mean, even before my tenure, at trying to move to a more agile software design so that we can continue to innovate and drive product forth into the marketplace for our customers.","I see sort of that continuing to continue to move in that evolution to drive to being really the best-in-class really at sort of that delivery to the end customer. Like any firm, we've got our share of things that go back and need to be updated, but we're thinking and will continue to deploy that technology in the latest way. We've been doing some work really across several areas of the firm, looking at how we deploy that technology to be more efficient. We're going to continue that work into other areas of the firm this year.","We have an active project pipeline of investments that we're looking at across operations. We're beginning to look in other areas where we can use the sort of the latest technology in terms of process automation, changing sort of upstream code to take out manual process and other items. We're really going through all of that in detail, driving that sort of just a more efficient framework for the company, but that is just sort of more resilient overall and better for our customers, better for our employees and better in everything we do.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks guys. Good evening. I had a question on the new referral program. I wanted to see how it was structured. So how do the economics flow between E*TRADE employees, RIAs in the institutional channel and E*TRADE shareholders?","Michael Pizzi","I mean, look, the referral network is set up such that the FC who refers into the network, obviously receives some semblance of compensation that comes through for that referral going out, because it's coming from that FC's book. If it's an E*TRADE client or customer that's on their books now and is looking for an advisory solution, then we also have the referral RIA is paying a fee into E*TRADE where the assets that are being referred out to it and then we receive the custody fees. So it's a fairly typical standard relationship and fees being driven, we believe in the right way with incentives lined up to create stockholder value.","Craig Siegenthaler","And any color on the size of those fees or the economics? And then, my last one here is, if a client moves into the institutional channel from the retail channel due to referral, how do you prevent this from driving a decline in ROCA for the clients that migrate just because in the retail channel they tend to be higher ROCA with higher cash balances and more trading?","Karl Roessner","Yes, so the way that we've looked at it and the data that we have is when one of our clients historically was looking at an advised solution, they had reached the point where they were either looking for professional help in managing their assets or they were looking for -- they didn't want to do it on their own anymore. They had reached the point where self-directed investments just didn't make sense for them, right, so they move to an advised solution, we lost the whole account. When you move into an RIA or an advised relationship, those assets stay with E*TRADE.","There is still a custodial relationship with E*TRADE, and more times than not based on the data that we have, the adviser who then holds that RIA relationship with the customer either brings in more assets or it consolidates assets in that account. So, we're actually not looking at decreasing ROCA from that customer. In most instances in the past, that just went to 0 because we lost the customer, right. So to us, this is a way to stem some of that and continue to have custodial fees and other fees coming in from the cash that we can manage and invest that we would have just lost in the past.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Will Nance with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Will Nance","Hi, good evening guys. I wanted to ask about the full year NIM guidance. So you're guiding for 320, which is basically what we printed this quarter, and there's still a rate hike left to come to the numbers. So I understand the loan portfolio runoff is a slight headwind to the lower starting point for the margin balances. I'm guessing lower ending reinvestment yields were a bit of a contributor. I guess, are there any other moving pieces? And I guess, if we do see further rate hike, can you talk about how that would flow through to the operating leverage guidance -- to the operating margin guidance?","ChadTurner","Yes, Will, this is Chad. The 320 that we guided, keep in mind, the rate hike from September is fully baked in there. So from that perspective -- and December, there's nothing else that will happen from that perspective. Just with the flattening of the curve we saw in Q4, the 300 to 325, holding that number, we're happy with that. I think that's a good number going forward for 2019. Obviously, that does hold margin flat. So any growth that you'd see there would be upside there, but that's really the way I would look at it.","Will Nance","Got it, okay. And then I guess you highlighted that you made a few tweaks to the five-year plan assumption. So removing rate hikes, moving the cash from 13 to 15. So nice to see evidence the things can change and you still feel confident in that plan. I guess, related to that, given the change in commission rates this quarter and guiding, I think, to roughly 5% pressure next year, what gives you the confidence that more significant commission rate pressure doesn't continue beyond next year? And I guess is this 5% pressure that we're seeing in line with the kind of modest pressure that's assumed in the five-year plan?","Karl Roessner","Yes, so what I would say is that some of that commission to pressure or other pieces, we're still in the plan at a $6.60 to $7 on CPT. That's what we see longer term. This quarter had some anomalies in it, right. The equities trades, again, sort of swamped out even the large level of derivatives trades that we had coming through. We still have additional individuals, as we said in the prepared remarks. We've increased those customer base or our customer base has increased on the derivatives side by 11% -- year-on-year, 11%. More of those accounts have been activated and are actively trading in the derivatives side. Most of that is the leg into our Power E*TRADE program, where there's a lower pricing point both on the trade commission and the contracts per trade price.","So you've seen some of that, then when you couple that with, as I would call it, sort of the perfect storm in the equity markets that drove down the value of the securities held in our stock plan channel, so those folks didn't transact because it just didn't make sense at that time. You had a lot of downward pressure on CPT, right. So it's a little bit different.","So I don't see the headwinds that we're talking about. What we have modeled in to get down to that $6.60 to $7 level, over the longer term is really the competitive rate dynamics at the higher end of the book where individuals who do a lot of business with us and have a very good revenue model with us want to lower CPT on their overall trades because they're doing so many of them, right. But that analysis is done taking into account the full client relationship on cash, on margin, on how much they transact with us, right, what are their balances, what do they do. So that's really the way I look at it more holistically. There is no 5% commission pressure baked in. So Chad, I don't know if you want to add anything on that.","ChadTurner","Yes, I would just point you back to the long-term earnings slide in the investor deck. Certainly, we mentioned that we talk about it moderating a bit, so there is some downward pressure in that long-term view. Also, if you look at the bottom part of that slide, you can see the relative contribution that's coming from transaction-based. So from that perspective, you can get a sense of how sensitive the long-term view is to additional pressure on commission pricing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Brian Bedell","Great, thanks very much. Maybe just to come back to the expense discipline; obviously, very good in the quarter. But just to come back to that outlook of, if we do get a tougher revenue environment, particularly if we end up moving into a fed cutting environment point over the next 12, 18, 24 months.","Just again your confidence on the 48% margin and getting to 50% and what areas would you be able to cut costs? Or is it mostly on technology and sort of digitization or do you feel like you might have to cut into some growth initiatives, if that were the case, to get to the margins?","Karl Roessner","So look, in any given year, any given quarter, right, even month-to-month, there is a list of prioritized projects that we go through that we invest in for growth. We're not going to stop investing in projects that are going to drive revenue growth or somehow take a -- the double whammy of cutting revenue production and trying to get rid of some cost.","So I think, when you look across that, what Mike Pizzi has been challenged to do is really implement technology solutions across ops, across some of our customer service platforms so that our customer, service reps can spend more time talking to individuals who actually need help with their finances, right.","Let's get rid of some of the calls about passwords and some other issues that are just customer dissatisfiers, let's knock those out using and employing technology and chat box, right, and other services that we can do.","So we free up some of the human capital to really handhold and touch our clients in different ways. So I think that's one piece. The other piece is obviously on the marketing side that we've talked about quite a bit.","We're not going to actively be cutting or looking to pull back, but obviously if the environment softens, there are different ways to deploy and different ways to go about those strategies. And then I'll turn it over to Chad. I think he is intimately familiar with these scenarios.","Chad Turner","Yes, Brian, I would just reiterate the value that we have gotten both externally as well as internally from having an operating margin framework. That's not just something we communicated with the external public.","But it's also something that is a guiding force and how we create our strategic and capital plan every year and how we make decisions as a management team and push those through all levels of the organization.","So that framework has served us well and we believe it can continue to serve us well. Obviously, we've been very committed as you've seen us hit those numbers. And so when we commit to those numbers, we feel broadly very good about it.","We think we have a lot of different levers or privatization that we can push around to continue to grow the business while committing to those operating margin targets.","Brian Bedell","Okay, great. Thanks very much. And then just maybe to the revenue side or the organic growth side. A lot of growth initiatives that you're optimistic about putting in the RIA segment, but is there any sort of outlook to get -- maybe to get back to your original target of that 5.8% to 6.8% in the next 1 to 2 years?","Are you optimistic? I know, it's not a technical goal right now, but are you optimistic that you think across these various growth initiatives that you can actually get up to that level closer to peers?","Karl Roessner","So we still believe that the growth initiatives, growth targets that we set out are the right ones for the business in the longer term, all right. Just because we stopped reporting on them, doesn't mean that we're not holding ourselves to them internally and driving toward that amount of organic growth to really continue to accelerate asset growth by bringing on more assets and also on the account growth side, but bringing in more high-quality customers and relationships, right.","Building those, rather than just looking at an aggregate number and say, we opened up this many new accounts. What's the quality of that account? What type of relationship do they have with us? Do we have the right investing solution? How can we deploy our digital wealth solutions to really drive at more customers and enhancing E*TRADE's brand in that space, right. So it's moving upstream.","That's a lot of what we're focused on. So make no mistake about it, we are absolutely all about organic growth. And I think some of the conversations we've had and some of the things that we've tried to show you all, particularly with supplemental deck we had last quarter, was the growth is there, right.","The pipeline that we filled through the corporate services channel is very nice a ground for us to use some of the new tools that we have at our disposal through our digital wealth offerings and through the new adviser network and our custody platform to really continue to onboard those assets and make them longer-term E*TRADE customers.","And then you take a look at what we're doing on the advisory services side and on the new network to drive additional asset growth. So we have not taken our eye off of organic growth whatsoever.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Michael Cyprys","Hey, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Just on the stock plan business, can you talk about how the retention rates have been trending there? And what do you think is achievable in, say, the medium-term?","Karl Roessner","So look, retention rates have been sort of locked in at that, call it, the 15% after the 12-month period. I think the thing to keep in mind when you think about that number or that percentage is all of the tools and all of the things that we've spoken about, whether it be from the basic robo solution to our managed account offerings, all the way up to sort of the managed product or the adviser network, all the way through the spectrum of what a client might do. Client is not a self-directed trader, if you will, right.","All of those are at our disposal to go out and help those stock plan participants now manage their finances on a daily basis. That 15% moving up to 16% or 17% on the now $200 billion-plus that's in the pipeline is an enormous amount of growth for us, for our customer base, for our revenue line and dropping straight to the bottom line. None of that increase or none of that is in our model going forward, right.","So that 15% or the historical rate that we held in those accounts, none of that has been factored in. It's why we are so excited about it. It's why we talk about it all the time. We think it creates an enormous opportunity for E*TRADE going forward. And it's the other reason why we continue to drive the stock plan business to onboard as many new corporate clients as they can, because it's a recurring stream for us.","So I think it puts us in a very good position in terms of whether it's 1%, 2%. The more important thing to us is to continue to serve those cooperates so that they remain steadfast E*TRADE Corporate Services clients and their stock plan participants remain in our pipes.","Michael Cyprys","Got it. Thanks. And then just as a follow-up, I believe you mentioned earlier you're targeting best-in-class delivery for your clients. I guess, what does that mean for E*TRADE in terms of best-in-class delivery? And if you could also just talk about more broadly the customer experience.","Karl Roessner","Sure.","Michael Cyprys","Where do you see that in three years and how different could that be?","Karl Roessner","So when I think about customer experience, I think, about and I talk about quite a bit what our vision is internally, right, as E*TRADE. And when we talk and it's plastered on all of our walls around our site, it's on our employees' desks and their computers, it's to be the number one digital broker and adviser to traders and investors known for ease of use and completeness of offering, right.","So the last two, I think, address your question in the biggest way, which is ease of use and completeness of offering. From the first touch as a customer, you need a mobile device, a mobile application, easy to download, easy to sign on to, ease-of-use on an online application, easy to find tools and services, a very simple chat bot that you can interact with if you don't like to talk to a human being or a very nice customer service rep on the other side, if you need help and you want some handholding, right. That's the beginning of it all.","And then what happens once you sign in and you log in to that environment and now, you're in E*TRADE's site, right. So you've gone in, you've logged in, you're a customer. Does it look the same? Does it feel the same? Is it easy to move around? Can you get what you look for in one click, right? Can you drop down a menu, not a hamburger and one of the sites that you have that's very hard to pull down, but can you sort of hover above it and see everything you want to see on that site and get right to it without getting confused? Is the educational offering complete? Is it easy to use? Is it easy to understand, right?","So, I like your time horizon, but we need to get there a lot quicker. I think we are very good today. We need to be great tomorrow, right. That's what E*TRADE has to be. We've always been the innovator and the disruptor in this space. To me, today, innovation has to start with, what does your customer want, right. What kind of interaction does your customer want from you? What do they demand out of the device? What do they demand from your platform? You have to read that upfront. You have to have the right data and analytics, and you need to drive it home all the way across your platform and site.","And every person in your organization, from the first touch all the way through senior management, all the way up to our board, needs to know that, that customer is first and foremost in our existence and reason for being, right. So it's a long winded answer, but over a three-year period, that's where we need to be. But it doesn't stop at three years. You've got to constantly innovate. You have to constantly listen to the feedback loop. What are your customers saying? What are the new market entrants, right?","We talk about all the times as a management team, yes, there's a lot of really cool technology out there, really easy apps to use, really nice things that people can do, what can we learn from that? What type of customer does that draw? What type of account does it open? How often do they interact? What types of balances do they bring? Do we want to offer that type of service? Does it cannibalize what we have? That's what we think about every day.","So the question you just asked is at the centerpiece of everything we strategically do a as an Executive Committee here at the firm all the way through our reason for being. So, it's a great question and I think it has to start with customer first, completeness of offering, ease-of-use. It's as simple as that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Kyle Voigt","Hi. Good evening. Just on the high yields savings offering, we're starting to see some nice growth in those deposits, just wondering if you could share any stats on either your share of wallet or attrition rates with brokerage customers that have that banking relationship with you versus those that don't. Because just in terms of the use of capital, I would think that you're generating a much lower NIM on the balance sheet growth funded with that high-yield savings deposit growth, for example.","So just trying to understand are there benefits and considerations for you, you may want to grow that business?","Michael Pizzi","Kyle, the way we think about it would be there's lots of opportunities in different products we have to get customers who are looking for a little more rate. Certainly, premium savings has been operating as good as we've been expecting or even better.","The way we think about it is a couple-fold. One, you have brokerage customers that are looking for rate and they may go somewhere else and then we've seen them go in there. I'd also note that we've seen a lot of external flows coming in there.","So as existing clients are opening a premium savings account and putting some money in there, they're also bringing other money in from other financial institutions, which is a good sign. And then we've seen lots of growth from new customers, bank-only.","And then lastly, I would say our bank products historically, you've seen that those have been running off slowly, some of the legacy products we've had on the savings side.","The nice thing we've seen here is that, this has been an opportunity for those customers that have been leaving historically. They've been actually coming over to the Premium Savings Account. So we're seeing a nice capture of those balances that we would have normally historically lost.","As we know, just as far as brokerage customers with banks relationships, we've talked before about how brokerage customers who have banking relationships trade more, they have lower attrition rates and they do more of their business with us. And so from that perspective, that's also been a really positive sign with Premium Savings.","Kyle Voigt","And just a follow-up on the expanding of your securities portfolio to include other asset-backed securities. Can you just confirm whether or not that's already reflected in the NIM guidance? And do you anticipate on growing the asset-backed portfolio to that 4% of earning assets by year-end '19 or do you expect to get better sooner? Thanks.","Karl Roessner","Yes, given the very slow, methodical build-out, it's not material for the NIM guidance for this year. So I think the NIM guidance -- it's really not in the NIM guidance, but I don't think it would make a difference, given the relatively small sizes we're talking about. Obviously, as we get into the out years, it can have a more meaningful impact. ","Operator","At this time I'd like to turn the call back over to our presenters for any final remarks.","Karl Roessner","Thank you all for joining us. We look forward to hearing from you and talking with you next quarter. Good night.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."],"7964":["E*TRADE Financial Corp.

No other recordings or copies of this call are authorized or may be relied upon.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Idzik.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Carlin. Good evening and thank you for joining us for our Q2 earnings call. While the retail trading environment was dampened by seasonality, the pace of our progress remained solid.","In core activities, we continue to demonstrate the resilience of E*TRADE's model, growing accounts and assets and hitting several notable milestones. We delivered on our commitment to do more for our customers, rolling out a number of new or enhanced products and services, including an upgraded retirement center and our groundbreaking app to the Apple Watch. We also further sharpened our focus, deciding to sunset our non-core Global Trading platform.","On the capital front, our risk profile extended its trend of steady improvement, while we continued to advance the ball for shareholders on the capital plan, navigating well the second annual DFAST process, distributing more than $140 million to the parent, and completing the steps to move our Clearing broker from under the bank. We also transitioned our finance leadership, welcoming a new CFO from within our executive ranks.","In summation, we had a lot going on, got a lot done, and started the second half of the year in a position of real strength, focused on continuing to deliver for our customers and our owners.","Elaborating a bit on the capital story, we completed a number of important components of our plan, most notably were steps to move E*TRADE Clearing. We completed the move on July 1, hitting the mark on our commitment to do so in the latter half of 2015. More than a matter of stellar marksmanship, the team under Mr. Pizzi's aegis, devoted significant time and energy to ensuring the transition was a smooth one, including determining funding and capitalization and completing the work to secure additional external lines of liquidity, bringing the total to approximately $900 million and contributing $150 million in capital from the bank. We are pleased to have completed this. We are now directing our focus towards what's next.","We also completed the second annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests. While not surprised, we are proud to say that our bank performed well under all stress scenarios, remaining above regulatory well-capitalized minimums by a healthy margin with bank Tier 1 leverage remaining above 10% even when stressed most stringently, and our risk weighted measures remaining at more than four times the regulatory minimums. It's worth mentioning that the stress tests utilized a reporting data as of the third quarter of last year and our legacy risks have diminished significantly since then, including a reduction in total loans of more than 15%. Overall, we are pleased with the results and feel good about the feedback we received from our regulators regarding our capabilities and methodology.","Today, we are in a very respectable position when it comes to future capital usage. Having knocked out some big-ticket items in the form of material reduction in debt and extracting once-trapped value from the bank through the brokerage moves, we march forward in determining our next capital initiatives. Mr. Pizzi will provide you with more details on our current thinking in just a few moments.","Turning to our financials, I feel it's an appropriate time to formally introduce our new CFO, Michael Pizzi. Mike took the CFO baton in mid-June after having been with the Company for more than a decade, latterly serving as our Chief Risk Officer, and before that serving a number of years as our treasurer. Mike is a strong, proven leader, and his expertise, regulatory experience, and considerable intellectual firepower make him an ideal fit. As you all get to know him, I'm sure you'll share my opinion and value the dialogue with him. I'm also certain that under Mike's leadership, we will resolutely prosecute our capital plan, maintain strong oversight of our Finance function, and continue to execute on other important financial initiatives.","As for the quarter's results, we recorded earnings of $72 million or $0.25 per share. This excludes a $220 million tax benefit related to the favorable outcome of an IRS audit. The quarter also included some unique items within our compensation, FDIC, and other expense lines: The first $6 million in compensation related to the departure of former CFO. The second, $9 million in other expenses related to a contract amendment with our former subsidiary, G1X. In a nutshell, we renegotiated the order routing agreement with our partners at G1X to provide us with greater flexibility and optionality as part of our staunch commitment to deliver the best possible execution for our customers.","And last, our FDIC expense dropped sequentially by $7 million. This expense reflects the calculation of both quantitative and qualitative assessments of risk, including the composition of the balance sheet, and overlaying regulatory judgment. We've indicated for some time that we expected our FDIC rate to ultimately reduce significantly, and that is exactly what happened in Q2. This is a strong testament to our progress de-risking, and improving our regulatory standing.","Going forward, we expect the FDIC rate will be approximately 8 bps on total assets, as opposed to the previous run rate of around 20 bps.","Before we get into metrics, I want to highlight a business decision made under the ministration of Mr. Pizzi during the quarter, which is to discontinue our non-core global trading platform. We found that it did not have the scale to justify the associated expense, capital, or energy. The accounts we did have, while reasonable in absolute quantum, weren't actively used, particularly as customers can access much of the same international exposure through our core US trading platform.","Importantly, we do not expect a significant outflow of assets related to these accounts as most of the customers are simply consolidating their investments into other E*TRADE brokerage accounts. We began the closure process in May and expect to complete it in early Q3. In total, we expect to close approximately 24,000 accounts, of which 3,300 were recognized in Q2 with the vast majority expected in July. This decision allows us to focus these resources on core products and services for our customer base.","Our brokerage metrics reflect some seasonality as the quarter opens at the zenith of tax season in April and closes as we head into the lulls of summer trading. DARTs of 149,000 were down 12% sequentially, with options representing a steady 23% of total activity. As volatility rose sharply in the first half of July amidst market turmoil in China and the melodrama in Greece, customer trading volumes have increased slightly, up 6% from June.","Mobile continued to represent an increasingly important component of our trades reaching a record 14% this quarter, compared to 11% a year ago. And underscoring the increasing trend of mobile adoption, roughly one-third of our unique logins during the quarter were through our mobile apps. We have also seen positive traction with our most recent Apple Watch app, with already 5,000 downloads since it launched in April.","Margin balances remained healthy during the quarter, even as the equity markets cooled slightly. We ended the quarter at $8.1 billion, just shy of the prior quarter's record high. We reported net new brokerage accounts of 19,000 during the quarter with the metric reduced by two items: First, approximately 3,300 accounts related to global trading as I just mentioned; and second, circa 3,500 accounts due to escheatment, an outsized number compared to normal levels as it related to a more comprehensive process concluded in May. Excluding these two items, net new brokerage accounts would have been approximately 25,000, with a normalized attrition rate of 8.7%, consistent with the prior quarter.","Net new brokerage assets were $900 million during the quarter, down considerably from Q1, largely a result of seasonality during tax season.","We have been diligent in our efforts to expand awareness of our retirement products and services. As a testament to the team's hard work, these assets have grown by more than 50% in just three years and have represented about one-third of total net new brokerage assets over the past two years. Furthermore, we continue to see stability in our managed assets, which ended the quarter at $3.2 billion.","As part of our effort to continue growing this element of our customer relationships, we revamped the retirement experience on etrade.com, creating a cleaner, simpler design, with inviting content that helps customers engage and take charge. It offers interactive widgets customized to each account, demonstrating the benefits of disciplined saving and investing; an account wizard that helps direct customers to the retirement account that is right for them; and personalized check-lists and to-do lists for each stage of an investor's retirement planning.","In addition to the new retirement experience, other noteworthy platform enhancements are as follows: On our active trader platform, E*TRADE Pro, we rolled out a robust new tutorial experience, new plug and play layouts to support the unique needs of traders, as well as improvements to several other customization features. We also simplified watch-list management and charting options and added the ability to trade tax lots across equity and options positions.","On etrade.com, we made a number of improvements to our stock plan participant experience and enhanced our bill pay functionality.","You will continue to see enhancements and innovations as we strive to better serve our customers in the fashion they find most relevant to support taking charge of their financial health. I encourage you to stay tuned.","One last item before I turn the call over. I'd like to take a brief moment to express my gratitude for the service of our former CFO. Matthew Audette was a faithful steward of E*TRADE and its finances for over 16 years, helping to guide the company through some of our most challenging times. We wish him the best in his future endeavors in sunny Southern California.","And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to our recondite CFO, Mike Pizzi.","Michael A. Pizzi - Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer","Thank you, Paul. It's a pleasure to be speaking with you on my first call as CFO. I'll get right into it. We accomplished a lot during the second quarter and we posted good results. Excluding the $220 million tax benefit, we recorded earnings of $72 million or $0.25 per share for the quarter, compared to $85 million or $0.29 per share in the prior quarter, which excluded a $73 million pre-tax charge related to our landmark corporate debt transaction. It also compares to $69 million or $0.24 per share in the year-ago quarter.","To quickly elaborate on the tax benefit, it resulted from an IRS audit of prior years' tax returns. So essentially, years ago we took a conservative position on the deductibility of certain tax losses and have been working with the IRS for some time to resolve this position. This tax benefit also resulted in an increase in our deferred tax asset, which ended the quarter at $1.1 billion, further increasing the shield against the payment of future tax dollars.","Turning back to the top. Total net revenues were $445 million in the quarter, compared to $456 million in the prior quarter and $438 million in the year-ago quarter.","Net interest income of $267 million was down $4 million from the prior quarter, as net interest spread contracted 12 basis points, partially offset by a $1.2 billion increase in average assets. The average balance sheet growth was driven primarily by third party deposits which moved back on balance sheet in conjunction with our new Sweep platform.","Although spread contracted sequentially at 250 basis points, it was in line with our expectations as interest rates remained challenging in the quarter. If we hold today's environment constant, our net interest spread would be in the low 240 basis point range in the third quarter.","Our balance sheet ended the quarter at $47.1 billion, up approximately $300 million from the prior quarter.","Commissions, fees and service charges, and other revenue in the second quarter were $167 million, down 5% from the prior quarter but up 2% from the year-ago quarter. Average commission per trade of $10.96 increased 2 cents from the prior quarter and 24 cents from the year ago. The year-over-year increase was driven largely by the mix of stock plan and option trades.","Fees and service charges revenues of $55 million increased from $52 million in the prior quarter. This is a result of more favorable revenue on third party deposit relationships and seasonally higher proxy fees, partially offset by slightly lower order flow revenue. As you may remember from last quarter, with the rollout of the new sweep platform, we determined it appropriate to reclassify the revenue generated from off-balance sheet deposits into fees and service charges from net interest income.","Net gains on loans and securities were $11 million this quarter, compared to $9 million in the prior quarter and just above our expectations of $5 million to $10 million. We expect to remain near the high end of the range if rates remain low, as they have been in the past couple quarters.","We recorded $309 million in operating expenses for the quarter, inclusive of severance and the expense related to the G1X contract amendment. Excluding these two items, our expenses for the quarter would have been $294 million, compared to $300 million in the prior quarter and $284 million a year ago.","For the full year 2015, we continue to expect expenses to be within our previous guidance range of a low to mid-single digit increase over 2014. This is inclusive of the two unique items in this quarter's numbers, along with the benefit to FDIC expense.","The loan portfolio ended the quarter at $5.7 billion, down $412 million or 7% from the prior quarter. This welcome decline was driven by higher than average prepayments among our borrowers. Net charge-offs of just $3 million across all loans were at the lowest level since Q3 of 2001. Provision expense was also $3 million, down from $5 million in the prior quarter, leaving our allowance unchanged at $402 million.","There are a few factors impacting provision this quarter: First, similar to how we previously reserved for high risk home equity loans nearing conversion, this quarter we established a lifetime reserve on a subset of higher-risk one to four family loans. Second, we made some changes to our modeling practices, which triggered a re-evaluation of the loss emergence period on loans covered in the general reserve. Based on our review of recent loan performance, current economic conditions and their impact on borrower behavior, we extended the loss emergence period from 12 to 18 months. These changes largely offset the positive impact of faster prepayments, improving credit quality, and lower-than-expected defaults on the balloon loans that matured during the quarter.","As of June 30, the balloon segment of the HELOC portfolio was approximately $120 million with an average of $20 million scheduled to mature over each of the next four quarters.","Over the next several quarters, we continue to expect provision to fall within a range of $0 million to $20 million per quarter. However, we are entering a period of increasing HELOC conversions, driving potentially greater volatility in future provision. As our HELOC portfolio converts to amortizing loans, it takes a month or two following the event to get meaningful performance data, and we don't yet have that for the 2015 subset. I expect we will have more data by Q4, and at that time will be able to provide clearer insight into the provision expense for 2016.","Turning now to the capital plan. It feels good to have the Clearing broker move behind us. The entity was already capitalized well in excess of regulatory requirements. However, we had to take steps to prudently bolster the position to meet funding requirements under aggressive stress scenarios. The $150 million of capital moved from the bank addresses the permanent working capital position, and the roughly $900 million in external lines meaningfully enhances the liquidity position. We anticipate these lines will cost us approximately $3-5 million annually, depending on usage.","As for our capital position, the bank's Tier 1 leverage ratio ended the quarter at 9.8%. Pro forma for the move of the Clearing broker, it would have declined by approximately 50 basis points, implying $113 million of capital in excess of our targeted 9.0% leverage ratio.","The bank's net income for the quarter was $114 million, which includes $20 million from the Clearing broker. We will seek approval to dividend the full amount to the parent in the current quarter. In addition, the introducing broker generated $30 million of capital during the quarter, and we intend to move that amount to the parent in the coming weeks.","Corporate cash ended the quarter at $406 million, an increase of $148 million from the prior quarter and well above our target of maintaining $100 million.","Now, with debt reduction and the broker moves behind us, we are entering the next evolution of capital planning, no longer with pressing needs, but rather a host of strategic opportunities to evaluate, and I'm proud to be running point on these initiatives. Each comes with a number of considerations, but I want to give you some context as to how we think about them: Balance sheet growth continues to be an attractive use of capital. And with our new sweep platform, we have the ability to operate close to the $50 billion threshold. In terms of composition, we are ever mindful of the possibility to accelerate the runoff of legacy funding and investments, including extinguishing wholesale funding obligations, disposing of the loan portfolio, and paying down trust preferred securities.","With respect to the wholesale funding, we ended the quarter with $4.5 billion of issuance obligations with $315 million set to expire in the second half of the year. While it is presently our intention to continue issuing those obligations, their termination would create capacity to onboard deposits, recasting our liability structure to be predominantly core-funded and low cost. However, doing so would also result in a loss of approximately $420 million pre-tax.","In terms of other funding, we could redeem all $433 million of trust preferred securities, of which the final 25% currently included in Tier 1 capital will be phased out in Q1 of 2016. However there is a handful of reasons we are not overly anxious to do so at the moment, including the fairly modest associated cost of these notes.","As for the loan portfolio, there continues to be a mismatch between what they are worth to us and what they might sell for in the secondary market. So while we intend to continue to hold them on our books, as the size continues to shrink and we work our way through the conversions, the gap could meaningfully narrow and our strategy could change.","With respect to other uses, we continue to prudently invest in the business while being mindful of any unique future opportunities. This of course includes taking advantage of the scalability of our core brokerage platform through acquisition, or expanding our product and service offerings.","And lastly, regarding dividends and share buybacks, while squarely on our radar until we achieve investment grade status, we remain restricted by covenants within our corporate debt.","The bottom line is that we are in a strong position when it comes to capital utilization opportunities. Having deployed a significant amount to reduce our corporate debt, we intend to continue evaluating the best path forward, and will update you when appropriate.","To summarize, we are in a position that we haven't been in for quite some time from a financial and capital standpoint and it's our goal to take advantage of this stance by continuing to provide value to our customers and shareholders.","On a personal note, I am excited to take on this new opportunity as CFO of such a tremendous company under the focused leadership of Mr. Idzik, and look forward to working with many of you.","And with that, operator, we will open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much, sir. Our first question comes from the line of Rich Reppetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good evening, Paul. Good evening, Mike. I guess the first question \u2013 Mike, thanks for going through the capital initiatives. And but we have built \u2013 we've built a significant \u2013 your cash at \u2013 corporate cash at $406 million, would we expect you to implement something in the quarter? We've been looking at these, the different alternatives for the last couple quarters. So would we expect some implementation in 3Q?","Michael A. Pizzi - Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer","Well, I think it's important to note with regard to ending cash across all the entities, not just corporate cash, that we took a fairly conservative position with regard to the movement of the Clearing broker and held more cash across all entities during that move and the complexity of that move.","As we were sizing the capital amounts that we wanted to move from the bank into the clear, the $150 million that we talked about, we thought it prudent to hold more cash really at multiple levels. As far as capital utilization, we continue to study the alternatives and when we have something really to come back with we will. There's a lot of complexity and nuances to these. I did talk a little bit about the debt covenants and other items. We continue to work through those.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","And I guess the one follow-up I would have and this goes right \u2013 speaks to your last answer. When \u2013 you've made real solid progress on the regulatory front, moving the clearing, the stress test impact, the FDIC premiums down significantly. And I know part of the process of looking at the wholesale funding was working with the regulators there. So I guess the question is \u2013 and you've also got the MOU removed at the OCC. So any additional \u2013 can you give us an update on the \u2013 what do you call it, correspondence with the regulators? Any update on the MOU with Fed and how you're working with the \u2013 I guess, on the wholesale funding conversation with them?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Rich, taking that envelope at data points, you got a very perspicacious question so I'll answer it directly. We were of course delighted in Q1 to have the progress we've made, trying to run our business in a much better controlled and managed way recognized by the OCC in lifting their MOU. And I'm absolutely pleased to report that in Q2 we saw the same activity by the Federal Reserve Bank. And our MOU has been lifted by the Fed in Q2, and I couldn't be prouder as a team.","The discussions we have with our supervisors are, what I'd say close and continuous. And there's nothing we have talked to the individuals on this call about that we haven't had the opportunity and benefit of having conversations with our regulatory supervisors. So you can rest assured if we're talking about it on this call that we have had productive conversations with our regulators as well.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","And can I just briefly follow. So the MOU from the Fed was lifted as well. Could you just briefly go through? I know I'm taking up too much time, but what the impact is of that? What that allows you to do?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","The impact of that as you noted of course is somewhat reflected in our FDIC premia. But what it really does, it just moves on a different \u2013 on a little different footing with the regulators in terms of either how quickly they might allow us to move and do certain things \u2013 we're just on a more stable regulatory footing and are having more discussions about the future of the firm and what we might do as opposed to the remediation that we were required to do at the MOU.","So if you will, Rich, we're more on the front foot in discussions with the regulators on shaping the future of the firm and what we want to do to grow the firm and do what we can to create value for our owners. And that dialogue shifted that way as opposed to still dealing with remediation. I mean, there's \u2013 just to be clear, Rich, we're not taking our foot off the gas on trying to continue to improve our regulatory standing in terms of what we're driving here and as well as the close conversations we have with the regulators helping shape how we build this firm better.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Got it. That's very helpful. Congrats on getting that done. Thank you.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks. Let's go to the next question, Carlin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you, guys. Another question on capital. Mike, if I heard you correctly, I think you guys are intending to dividend the full amount of excess capital at the bank up into the parent in the current quarter now that Clearing is separated. And I'm just wondering if you do that does that prevent you from potentially growing the bank balance sheet if you wanted to?","Michael A. Pizzi - Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer","You heard correctly. It's not the amount of excess capital; it's the amount of prior period earnings, which at the bank level was $114 million. We do intend to apply to dividend that to the parent company. Certainly, giving our capital target of 9%, having more capital would allow us to grow the balance sheet. So moving that capital up to the parent does create the possibility of less growth to the balance sheet versus more parent capital available. And those are some of the things that we evaluate in terms of the positioning of the bank balance sheet versus the corporate cash position and the capital alternatives that we are studying.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I see. Okay. And if you could maybe help us out with just reviewing really quickly what the covenants are with your data as it relates to stock buybacks? Are you completely prevented from doing them at this point or are there certain thresholds or triggers that have to be met in order to be able to buy back stock here?","Michael A. Pizzi - Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer","Yes. Each debt instrument outstanding has slightly different covenants. But the most restrictive of them right now would put a limit of about $100 million on buybacks. Now if that one was not in place, we would then fall to an earnings basket on the remaining items, which would be different by debt instrument. Without getting into the nuances or specifics we're talking, it's probably about a few hundred million dollars.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And that's in totality \u2013 $100 million in totality or is that an annual number or...?","Michael A. Pizzi - Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer","That's the totality that it would grow and scale with earnings. Now I do want to add one important point. The covenants will go away if we reach investment grade status. So we took that into account when we sized the amount of debt outstanding and we pursued quantitative metrics consistent with an investment grade rating.","Obviously the assessment of the qualitative side of that is with the rating agencies and we hope that they conclude their work soon. But I'm sure they're looking for some degree of suitability of those metrics.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi. Good evening.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Steve.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Mike, I appreciate all the color that you provided on the capital side. I was hoping to dig in a bit further, first relating to Chris's question. Are there explicit actions that you need to undertake based on the dialogue that you've had with the rating agencies thus far in order to obtain that investment grade status?","Is it going to actually require a portfolio sale or is it simply sufficient comfort with the current earnings trajectory that it can be sustained? I just want to have a better understanding of that, given the significant capital that you have and the share repurchase considerations.","Michael A. Pizzi - Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer","Yes, I think it's more of the latter. In terms of the quantitative metrics on what we have achieved in terms of the debt profile and debt serviceability, we believe sets us at the quantitative level for investment grade.","From what they are looking at I think more, I think the important progress that we're talking about today in terms of what we have achieved with our regulators, the decline in expenses from the FDIC are all going to be very important items in that assessment. But I think at this point I would say it's a qualitative assessment and it's sustaining the performance.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then maybe just on the topic of the \u2013 potential for a loan portfolio sale, obviously it will be dependent on the economics ultimately, but just thinking about the expense benefit that would be raised, clearly the FDIC assessment fee would go lower from 11 bps to the target potentially of 8 bps over time. You also have the lower servicing costs. Can you help us think through what additional cost benefits would be realized maybe in terms of risk management and resources allocated there, once the portfolio sale is in fact completed?","Michael A. Pizzi - Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer","Yes, I think first just to clarify on the FDIC. The reduction in expense for this \u2013 in the quarter that we are reporting occurred intra quarter. So the run rate going forward will be about \u2013 just about 8 basis points. What that means is the benefit on a full quarter basis is in the $10 million to $11 million range. Now, turning directly to the loan portfolio, sales of loan portfolio would cause a bit further of relief, but not really a material amount in terms of FDIC premiums.","So in Other Expenses you are really getting into \u2013 you're getting into head count and you are getting into some degree of professional services that we have deployed around the portfolio and certain other contracts for modeling and other items. We've never really broken those out. I'm not really going to break them out today, but it's a modest level of overall expense.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then just one quick follow-up for me regarding the FDIC fee rate. So the eight basis points is where you're running at currently. Is there any potential to drive that even lower, or is that lever been effectively exhausted?","Michael A. Pizzi - Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer","I would say it's effectively where it's going to be. The effective methodology, if you review it, does look at capital ratios. It does look at asset quality. Certainly parts of our \u2013 the remaining loan portfolio are still calculated in that methodology. But the items that we're talking about are going to move it in a very small way.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Conor Fitzgerald with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Conor B. Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good afternoon. Just going back to your comments on potentially using capital for balance sheet growth, can you give us an update on the amount of deposits you have off balance sheet that you think you could bring back on?","And then I guess logistically speaking, if the $50 billion capital is raised, how quick could you think you can bring them back on balance sheet?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, first of all, Conor, welcome to the call. First time you're running point for your firm.","Michael A. Pizzi - Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer","Yes, in terms of the total amount of off balance sheet deposits, there is about $10 billion that's off balance sheet. In terms of what we could bring back, it's about $10 billion up to $15 billion. Some of it can be brought back very quickly because it's already in a sweep deposit program, other a bit slower because it's sitting \u2013 it's in a money fund program, but all of that can be brought back. So over time, the amount's about $10 billion and relative to the speed at which it can be deployed, it can be brought back fairly quickly.","Conor B. Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. That's helpful. And thanks for the well wishes. And on the securities deal, I think they declined a little more than I think I and a couple or two were expecting this quarter just given what happened with rates. Was there a change in your investment strategy or duration for the securities you guys are buying this quarter?","Michael A. Pizzi - Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer","No, there's not really a change in the composition of security, because the main driver there is prepayment activity, is an increase in prepayment speeds. Even though rates in the second quarter are a little higher, prepayment speeds as you know lag from prior period rate effects. So the low rates we felt in Q1 drove a bit of a speed increase on the portfolio in Q2, and so the primary factor, it actually just amortization on the portfolio.","Conor B. Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then the wash, we're pretty happy about that.","Michael A. Pizzi - Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer","Yes. I think overall we're pretty happy.","Conor B. Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Daniel T. Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Just a question on the potential P&L impact if any around the global trading closure that you announced. As we think about modeling, is there any other line items that will be impacted by that?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","This is actually something that Mr. Pizzi started while he was in his Chief Credit Officer role. So he's been looking at this for a while. Mike?","Michael A. Pizzi - Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer","Yes. The global trading business, really as we looked at it, starting from more of a strategic risk review as Risk Officer, now really seeing at the completion as Financial Officer is really a non-core business.","To give us some idea of trading volumes, it was 0.1% of all trades in the year 2014. So it's not a meaningful amount of overall trades. The product would have required some additional technology investment. It also was capital and efficient in terms of the capital exposures at the Clearing broker-dealer.","And given the need to reinvest, given the capital and efficiency, given that it didn't provide much in terms of revenue or trading, we thought it best to shut it down. And most importantly, I think to add is that the evolution of the market since the product was introduced gives customers the ability to really have these positions and exposures in their regular E*TRADE account, making the product really unnecessary. So really the growth potential of the product is really quite limited.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And actually the much clearer tax positioning as a result as well for the customer.","Michael A. Pizzi - Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer","Yes.","Daniel T. Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Got it. And then I guess just a question on the provision. And I get your guidance and we are, but you continue to come in well below that as we did further into the amortization period. And so I'm wondering is \u2013 it seems as if even that while it's small in terms of where we are, the data you're seeing continues to be positive. So I guess if there's any other quantitative or qualitative comments you can make about your outlook for the credit of that \u2013 of the portfolio? And I'm thinking about it on a longer term basis.","Michael A. Pizzi - Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer","Sure. The priority where we have some data to look at was really around the small portion of portfolio that's in balloons. That we can \u2013 we'd say is performing better than our original expectation. Around the larger portion of the portfolio and the end of draw, we really don't have much data yet. We said that of the 2015 end of draw risk population we would not really have that data till the back half of the year.","And so really, we really just start to see now a pickup in the amount of loans coming to that. So \u2013 and really, with looking at that we need to see the event occur; we need to see a population of data move through the delinquency chain before we can really reach any sort of assessment as to the accuracy of our model. We feel that we've captured the risk adequately and are very happy with the modeling approach that we've taken. But until we have that data, we're not going to know really significantly one way or another.","Daniel T. Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good evening, Paul. Good evening, Mike. Just another question on credit provisions. Just on the 1-4 book specifically, provisions have been taken up there over the last few quarters. Feels like this quarter's spike up was more of a one-off \u2013 more one-time cleanup. So should we expect provisions in that specific book to maybe tick down from here or how should we think about those trends?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. So this quarter, the provision in 1-4 family was directly affected by what I talked about in the prepared remarks. We took a special reserve on that population of high risk 1-4 family loans, so loans that we've identified as a pool of heightened risk. So that's additive to the allowance balance for the 1-4 family.","Also, the increase in the emergence period from 12 to 18 months will increase that allowance balance as more loans are now in the emergence period. And you are right to think that those two steps are really one-time items as the portfolio is static and in runoff mode. So from there that \u2013 as loans move through the period, they'll move out of that \u2013 they'll move out of the allowance balance.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. So just to be clear, if I look back through 2013, you released provisions there et cetera to tick back up from Q4 last year. But you're saying at this point, probably expect it to kind of go back down?","Michael A. Pizzi - Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer","Well, I think I have to \u2013 so I would put it this way; if you just sort of assume all things equal on a declining portfolio, yes. But it will obviously be driven by entry-level delinquency, by underlying LTV, by changes in severity, so in any given period it could go up or down.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. That's understood. And just another follow-up question also on the securities yield. Just remind us what kind of reinvestment yields you're getting on your AFS and held-to-maturity books?","Michael A. Pizzi - Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer","Yes. The marginal reinvestment rate right now is between about 150 basis points and 200 basis points; bounce around a little bit with rates during the quarter, but that's about where we've been averaging.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's great. Thank you. And then on the off balance sheet deposits, specifically the money market funds, just provide us an update in terms of the process of I think system changes, of customer notifications, how long that would take? Maybe any timeline you can provide there would be helpful.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, for some of the money market funds of course that's a very specific choice by the customers. They could be in tax-advantaged product. How long it takes to essentially repaper those? That could take several months, maybe across two or three quarters actually to get that done.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys. Just Mike, one question on the net interest spread outlook. So I guess you gave some of the reinvestment rates. When I put that together with the wholesale runoff and then the loan runoff, just wanted to get a sense in this like the current rate backdrop. Do you have sort of a range of like a floor and a ceiling where you guys can manage it with the current hedging strategy in place?","I know longer-term there's a lot of factors that will factor into it depending on what you do with the capital. But just wanted to get some sense, given the decline we saw and then some of your comments on the prepayments?","Michael A. Pizzi - Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer","Well, as I highlighted before, the decline that you see in the period from securities is really driven by an increase in prepayments. And that's really driven by some of the much lower rate levels we saw in Q1.","So looking at that overall level of volatility, that will go up and down as we see activity in prepayments move. Looking \u2013 in terms of spread, we think that the 240 basis point range really holds for \u2013 as we said in the prepared remarks, given the marginal reinvestment rate and given where other items in our business are now.","Obviously, growth in the margin book can significantly impact overall spread as well as the stock loan book. Those two are going to be more volatile in terms of the equity markets, but right now we expect them to hold up quite well.","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Got it. And then just as a follow-up, on the expense guide \u2013 and you say, low to mid single-digits. Just wanted to make sure, when you look at 2014, just because last year there were some items or charges during the year, just wanted to get maybe the base that that's off. I think from how we're calculating it might put it around this level for the remainder of the year. But I just want to make sure we're using a good starting base.","Michael A. Pizzi - Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer","I think it's \u2013 if you are talking about some of the larger special charges, obviously those will come out. It's the operating expense number that you can see for the full year there. I think it's around $300 million or so per quarter I think is probably the right range of overall expense in terms of the low to mid single-digit number.","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good evening, folks. Maybe just to go back to the expense. Maybe just thinking about it from a run rate perspective, you are down to about $295 million ex the one-timers and then the FDIC expense going down to $290 million and then the other expense was a little elevated aside from that. So what would be the driver to bring that expense level up above $290 million for the next two quarters?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think as we talked about the past, we've made a number of investments. Some of the investments \u2013 you heard me talk about in terms of risk on the last call. While we don't expect those \u2013 expenses there to go up, we have been making additional investments across the company in terms of technology and resiliency and now beginning to make some more investments around customer experience and other items. Those are certainly the drivers of our overall expense picture from here.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So it's incremental to what's in the run rate right now?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's correct.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right. Okay. And then maybe come back to capital, on the wholesale pay down, the loss of \u2013 the $420 million loss obviously and considering \u2013 I think you were working on some tax sharing agreements. There were some complications in that analysis.","Just to get I guess a better sense of how attractive you think that is, it looks to me like it would be the most accretive use of capital. I guess what is the biggest holdback from doing that?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, I think when you look at the yield table you are calling it out quite correctly. It's very expensive liabilities. The marginal rate of reinvestment is quite low.","And you can look at just the absolute portfolio yields. So the accretion that you are highlighting there, we're well aware of that. Right now it is our intention to continue to issue the debt obligations to determine the issuance requirement, but we continue to study this. We have to take very carefully the absolute usage of capital from a Tier 1 regulatory capital perspective and be quite thoughtful about the usage of that $420 million of capital to take that charge.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then maybe just last on the \u2013 running the balance sheet closer to $50 billion, looks like you do have some more room to do that in the near-term and this would be one I guess easy use of excess capital. But going back to the comment about the dividend'ing the capital up from the bank to parent, the $114 million that you mentioned, does that preclude you from running the balance sheet closer to $50 billion in the near-term?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","The amount of excess capital that we have net of the Clearing broker move would put the ratio at about 9.3. Our target is nine, so there is some excess there. There is also capital generated within the period. So the dividend of the $114 million of earnings does \u2013 would increase the capacity of the balance sheet if we left it within the bank. We think it's the right thing at this time to continue dividend'ing the earnings of the bank up to the parent company. If we make a change there, we will discuss it and let you know.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And maybe just lastly just on the NIM guidance and the 240s, is that entirely due to the securities book within your guidance or are there other significant factors in that guidance?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's largely the securities book. We have seen a bit of compression in overall margin yield in terms of that book as well and there has been a small amount of compression in loan yields from the prepayment effect on the loan portfolio as well. So it's factoring all of that in into what the spread guidance is.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bulent Ozcan with RBC. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Bulent Ozcan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Hi, good evening. Just a quick question maybe on the stress testing. It seems like you've been very successful; you've passed with flying colors. And my thinking would be that the regulators are very happy with you \u2013 with the progress that you've achieved.","So in terms of maybe crossing the $50 billion threshold, what needs to be done to get over the threshold? What kind of investments do you still need to make, if any, as opposed to kind of waiting for regulatory changes that might or might not happen?","Michael A. Pizzi - Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer","We're pretty convinced right now that we have a menu of opportunities to use capital that are attractive to our owners. And the $50 million threshold is not one of the areas that are on our near-term menu.","Bulent Ozcan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I see. Maybe on the NIM, so if you were to address the legacy issues and deal with the loan book, what will be the impact on NIM? I haven't run the numbers, but maybe you could just give us an update based on where we are today and the 240 bps NIM that you basically expected for the third quarter, if you have any changes there in rates? Have you kind of run the numbers? I was just want to get a sense of how attractive it is.","Michael A. Pizzi - Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer","Would you clarify that question?","Bulent Ozcan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes. So my \u2013 like my understanding was that the loan books, if you (50:51) the loan books you also have to \u2013 that \u2013 if you want to get rid of the wholesale filing, you also need to deal with the loan books or kind of reduce your loan books. And I'm trying to get a sense of what the impact on your overall net interest margins would be.","Michael A. Pizzi - Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer","Yes. I think if you look at the yield table, you can see the effect of yield to the loan portfolio. We've given sort of the marginal reinvestment rate of $150 million to $200 million. A good estimate might be to take the midpoint of that range. But of course a lot will matter here in terms of the value you realize on a sale, the capital impact in terms of modeling that.","So I think \u2013 rough numbers, you can get pretty close, but there's a lot of \u2013 there's a lot that has to be worked through in the specifics of any transaction. Obviously, as we said before, we intend to hold the portfolio. We feel that the value we can achieve is below \u2013 the value that we can achieve in a sale is below the value of holding it. But that could potentially change as market conditions continue to change.","Bulent Ozcan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I see. And maybe final one on the net interest \u2013 or net income at the bank, it was $114 million this quarter, up from $92 million. Was anything unusual there, or should we kind of think about that as a run rate and what might be dividend up to the holding company?","Michael A. Pizzi - Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer","No, you should not think of that as the run rate. That includes a portion of the tax settlement that went through the bank.","Bulent Ozcan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And there appear to be no further questions on the phone lines at this time. Gentlemen, I'll now turn the conference back to you.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I just want to thank everyone again for joining us and hope everyone has a great rest of the evening.

No other recordings or copies of this call are authorized or may be relied upon.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Pizzi.","Michael Pizzi","Good evening, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter earnings call. Over the quarter, we continued to build our leadership position across business channels, achieving strong operating and financial results. However, as you are all well aware, the most noteworthy developments took place after we closed the books on Q3 as October ushered in another round of commission reductions by competitors, prompting us to eliminate retail commissions for online U.S. listed stock, ETF and option trades.","Although we did not believe that this prior pricing structure presented a meaningful barrier to investing for our target customers, the step-down to 0 has taken the conversation entirely off the table. Whether through simple transactions or investment management through funds, individuals can now gain access to the financial markets with 0 friction. The value proposition for customers is truly extraordinary. While we did not favor this shift, we believe it enhances our competitive position in our core retail franchise. In this new paradigm, platform, functionality and customer experience are more important than ever. And that is where we truly differentiate.","We have an unrivaled active trader platform and service model, which has led to record customer engagement. We offer easy-to-use, intuitive managed solutions that deliver across passive, active and specifically tailored allocations in portfolio management in a manner that rivals the best in the business. For years, the E*TRADE business model has generated the highest revenue yield on customer assets across the peer set. And under the new pricing structure, we believe that gap should only widen. We now offer the #1 platform in the business at the lowest price point in the industry, which we expect to be a killer combination in the battle for market share.","We have a mobile experience that rivals the best confidence capabilities, packaged in a simple and intuitive interface. And we provide our customers with the best-in-class service experience. This strength is only reinforced by our broader franchise as our industry-leading Stock Plan Administration platform and our expanding adviser services offering provide differentiated growth vectors.","Shifting to published results. The third quarter brought a heightened level of activity across the capital markets. Rhetoric on international trade, mixed economical results across the global economy, shocks to the supply of oil, volatility in the overnight repo market and even speculation on impeachment drove significant volatility with some of the greatest day-to-day moves in equity markets, interest rates and commodity prices in several years.","Against that backdrop, we observed a meaningful shift in retail investor sentiment during the quarter as our customers were net sellers of securities for the first time since 2016. The increase in uncertainty and market volatility provides an environment in which our operating and financial model shines brightly. In a quarter that is typically associated with the summer slowdown, we generated a strong level of customer trading activity.","Even more encouraging in the volume of trade is the mix of activity with 95,000 derivative DARTs in the quarter or a 36% share of total DARTs representing our strongest mixed ever. This activity bodes well for our future, where the vast majority of the industry's transaction-based revenue will come from derivative trading.","In terms of product rollouts, we continue to keep our foot on the gas, launching a series enhancements to Power E*TRADE, our active trader platform, that should continue to drive growth in derivative trading. We launched new functionalities such as our enhanced strategy seek experience, which helps structure an options trade based on a preferred strategy or criteria, panel enhancements to our live-action market scans and an exit plan strategy to help traders mitigate risk on open positions.","On the mobile front, we've improved our voice capabilities by incorporating Google Assistant functionality, allowing users to check their portfolio using voice commands while on the go. In August, we were rated the #1 online broker in Kiplinger's annual review. This review is one of the longest running and best respected in our industry and largely focuses on the broker's long-term investing and managed product offerings. This result offers tangible proof of the progress we have made on the investing front. Over the past several years, we have delivered meaningful improvements to our offering. For instance, we offer the most no transaction fee mutual funds with 3-star ratings or higher and the broadest access to new corporate bond issuances. When combined with the frictionless and easy-to-use digital experience, the result is a top-notch investing offering.","On assets, we generated $2.8 billion of net new retail and adviser services assets, which includes nearly $400 million into managed products, one of our best quarters for managed product flows ever and a testament to our focus on building out a compelling investing offering.","With respect to the institutional, Stock Plan Administration remains in the industry spotlight as other providers seek to expand their market share through acquisitions and partnerships. We are the leader in the market and continue to build on our competitive position. Punctuated by ongoing success from our all-star sales team, we continue to differentiate ourselves from the pack with enhanced tools and functionality. As just one example, in September, we teamed up with Carver Edison, a startup in the employee stock purchase plan space that allows employees to maximize their plan contributions through an innovative cashless participation process.","Furthermore, we celebrated the #1 ranking in stock plan loyalty and overall satisfaction for the eighth consecutive year by Group Five. E*TRADE was also the highest rated among full administration plan sponsors for helping participants understand the value of their equity awards and how they can be used to help meet financial goals, which is key to unlocking the full value of our stock plan channel and translating it into retail growth.","We continue to benefit from the robust business momentum in this channel. And in the third quarter, we brought on $5 billion of new corporate services relationships. Over the last 12 months, we have generated approximately $100 billion of gross stock plan inflows through new grants, implementations and stock plan purchases. Our outsize success in this area has surpassed even our own lofty expectations and further bolsters our forecast for cash growth. As a reminder, relationships sourced through our stock plan channel tend to be more heavily weighted towards cash. And with $30 billion of participant proceeds over the last 12 months, the available pool of opportunity for retail asset growth continues to deepen.","As for adviser services, we are seeing strong interest from advisers on both the traditional custody side, where we have increased the number of small to midsize RIAs on the platform, and when the E*TRADE -- and within E*TRADE Advisor Network, where we continue to add larger advisers to local, regional and national levels. As of the third quarter, the referral program is operational at all 30 regional branches as well as our 2 national branches.","A key to capitalizing on the symbiotic growth inherent in our referral program as well as more fully penetrating our corporate services partnership relationships is our financial consultant sales force, a group in which we continue to invest for growth. Since last year, we have increased the total FC flow headcount by more than 60 to a total of approximately 380 and intend to expand this team further over the medium term.","Shifting back to the economic and competitive backdrop. The current environment certainly provides a share of challenges across the industry. Since the beginning of this year, the Fed has cut interest rates 2 times, and the market expects a greater than 50% chance of at least 2 more cuts by March of next year, while the 10-year treasury yield broke through 150 basis points to just 10 basis points north of its all-time low.","When we set our expectations of greater than $7 per share in 2023, we had accounted for potential macroeconomic pressure and contemplated offsets, including opportunistic strategies around balance sheet management and share repurchases as well as flexibility around expense containment. We also anticipated the potential impact of continued commission compression consistent with historical trends. What we did not include were value-eroding moves by competitors to slash commission revenue precisely when the markets look least robust.","We still believe our business model is geared to generate the best operating leverage in the industry, and we expect we can still grow EPS at a double-digit pace annually over the long term. However, after removing roughly $300 million in annual commissions, unsurprisingly, our long-term estimates have been revised downward. While EPS that exceeds $7 per share continues to be wholly achievable, we anticipate getting there are a year later than originally articulated. Given the reduction in commission revenue, the expected rate environment and the resulting impact on capital generation and capital return, our current management estimates produce approximately $6 in 2023 EPS and $7 in 2024.","In addition to slashing commissions and reducing interest rates, we layered in modest growth in cash from our institutional and retail initiatives and shifted to growing deposits on balance sheet earlier than previously contemplated given the anticipated modest steepening of the yield curve. We believe that our forecast remains robust across a wide range of economic and operating scenarios given the multiple often offsetting levers inherent in our business model.","We will continue to be proactive in driving value in this environment. First, we are staying focused on sustainable long-term revenue growth. While the commission cuts will result in a step-down, we anticipate being able to grow the top line by mid- to high single digits and expect to grow EPS by double digits, albeit off a lower base.","Second, we are continuing to use our substantial capital generation and balance sheet flexibility to deploy capital in the most accretive way possible. In that vein, we have the ability to complete our current buyback program by Q3 of next year. And if we were to freeze the current rate curve, that's exactly what we would do. But we will remain dynamic and shift quickly to resume balance sheet growth should the curve steepen to a level that makes the value of doing so more compelling for our shareholders.","And third, we are intensifying our focus on cost containment. While we had expense initiatives underway prior to October, we are executing with even more vigilance given the involved competitive landscape, committing to a sequential reduction in operating expenses in 2020. To that end, we have a taken a hard look at our corporate facility's footprint and have decided to consolidate our New York City and Jersey City locations by the end of this year, eliminating our higher-cost New York location while co-locating 2 high-performing teams for improved productivity.","To end on a personal note, it is a great privilege to lead this storied company. We have accomplished a great deal over the last several years. The current competitive and market backdrop certainly provides challenges, but we have the right team and strategy in place to capitalize on our leading positions, iconic brand and complementary channels to drive growth in our franchise and value for our shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to Chad to walk through the results.","Chad Turner","Thanks, Mike. For the quarter, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $254 million or $1.08 per diluted share on record net revenues of $767 million. Included in the quarter was a $12 million pretax or $0.04 per share benefit to provision for loan losses. As for core results, net interest income decreased by $35 million sequentially, driven primarily by a $6 billion decrease in our average interest-earning assets as we continue to shift deposits off balance sheet. This was partially offset by an 8 basis point expansion of our net interest margin to 328 basis points. Our NIM benefited from strong securities lending revenue and a favorable securities mix following the sale of $4.5 billion of lower-yielding investment securities at the end of Q2.","Our blended deposit rate, including deposits held off balance sheet, reduced by 2 basis points during the quarter to average 34 basis points, driven by cuts in our customer cash rates following the Q3 Fed cuts, offset by a mix shift resulting from promising growth in our premium savings balances. For Q4, we expect the blended deposit rate to be 27 basis points, noting this rate includes both on and off balance sheet sweep deposits, bank deposits and brokerage customer payables and assumes a 25 basis point Fed cut in October. Our average reinvestment rate in the securities portfolio is approximately 250 basis points.","For the full year, we anticipate generating a NIM of 315 to 320 basis points, consistent with the expectations we have given in prior quarters. This guidance holds customer margin balances at their current levels, assumes deposits grow off balance sheet and contemplates one Fed funds rate cut in October. Each 25 basis point move down in short-term rates translates to a 6 basis point annualized impact to NIM.","Overall, Q3 was a solid quarter for customer cash growth with total customer cash and deposits ending the quarter at $65 billion, up approximately $3 billion from Q2. While customer net selling helped drive overall customer cash balances higher, margin balances held up nicely with $9.9 billion of average balances over the quarter, down slightly from Q2 levels. This is another example of how our overall active trader business continued to shine even during periods of market uncertainty.","Commission revenue of $122 million was up $1 million sequentially, driven by an extra half trading day in the quarter and a $0.04 higher CPT, offset by 1,000 fewer DARTs. CPT of $7.18 came in as expected, well within our previously guided range of $6.90 to $7.30. Fees and service charges of $163 million were up $37 million sequentially as we shifted an additional $2 billion of deposits off balance sheet over the course of the period. The average net yield on third-party cash was 196 basis points, comprised of third-party money market fees of 53 basis points and third-party sweep deposit fees of 218 basis points, both net of deposits.","For Q4, we anticipate gross fees from off balance sheet sweep deposits will be around 195 basis points and expect net fees to -- will be approximately 180 basis points, which contemplates an expected 25 basis point cut in Fed funds in October. We anticipate net money market fees will stay flat to Q3 levels.","Towards the end of the year, we will have an option to sweep premium saving deposits to third-party institutions. This will provide added flexibility to manage our balance sheet size and extend FDIC insurance protection up to $1.25 million for our premium savings customers.","Outside of money market and sweep deposit revenues, the remaining components of fees and service charges totaled approximately $100 million, down $2 million from last quarter. Gains were $16 million in the quarter as we sold securities to capitalize upon the continued rally in rates and further reduce the balance sheet size. Going forward, we expect to realize around $10 million to $15 million of gains per quarter.","Shifting to expenses. Total noninterest expenses of $399 million were relatively flat to last quarter as a $7 million reduction in marketing spend was offset by a host of other impacts. We now anticipate our marketing spend to come in just over $190 million for the full year 2019.","Highlighting a couple of other expense items. Clearing and servicing expenses ticked up from $32 million to $36 million, while FDIC insurance costs ticked down slightly from $4 million to $3 million, both driven by our shift of deposits off balance sheet. We currently pay approximately 3 basis points in FDIC insurance for deposits held on our balance sheet and approximately 8 basis points in servicing fees for deposits held off balance sheet.","This quarter's adjusted operating margin, which excludes provision benefit, was 48%. For the full year, we anticipate generating an adjusted operating margin of approximately 44%, including potential discrete charges relating to the restructuring or exit cost from our cost containment initiatives in the fourth quarter.","Shifting to the pricing changes. The impact from eliminating retail commissions for online U.S.-listed stock, ETF and options trade is roughly $300 million per year, assuming the most recent quarter's trading activity. We plan to offset a material portion of this forward on revenue through a host of revenue and expense initiatives.","As we diligently review the profitability dynamics of our customers post commission reduction, we are thoughtfully approaching solutions and are exploring ways to minimize underutilized fees and features for those with less complex needs as well as ways to monetize customer activity most effectively. We are also taking a hard look at additional efficiency gains, including facilities expenses, vendor relationships, and are putting a deeper focus around the allocation of resources.","As Mike mentioned, we are targeting a reduction to our noninterest expense in 2020, even after excluding any onetime costs in 2019. To put numbers around this, we expect noninterest expenses to total approximately $1.5 billion in 2020, though we will remain tactical and spend into growth should we find opportunities.","Moving to capital. We executed on $566 million of share repurchases in Q3 as we completed our previously -- previous $1 billion authorization and made progress against our current $1.5 billion program. While the commission cut slows our near-term capital generation, we can offset this in the near term through our flexibility to shift deposits to third-party banks and further reduce the size of our balance sheet through expected securities runoff. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 28%, elevated slightly from a few discrete items. We expect the full year 2019 rate to be approximately 27%.","We finished the quarter at $380 million of corporate cash, reflecting $695 million in subsidiary dividends less the $566 million used to repurchase our stock, $34 million paid in common dividends and $20 million paid in preferred dividends. As a reminder, we target holding a minimum of $300 million in corporate cash.","Before concluding, I just wanted to highlight a couple of other quick housekeeping items. First, we plan to complete our review of the new accounting standard for current expected credit losses, also known as CECL, in the fourth quarter. We currently anticipate this will result in a net benefit to equity of approximately $75 million to $100 million, which will be reflected in the first quarter of 2020. This benefit primarily relates to the write-up of the collateral backing our legacy loan portfolio. We will provide an update on the fourth quarter call when we have finalized our review.","Second, as we contemplate the presentation of our trading metrics, we anticipate future releases will look largely similar to today's, capturing all customer-directed trading activity. We will continue to separately present derivative activity. Given the addition of commission for ETFs and promotional trades to this metric, we anticipate the change will only slightly increase the amount of DARTs we report.","And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.","Steven Chubak","So I wanted to start off, Mike, with a question on the October strategic update. At that time, you had outlined some earnings and probability targets. And the message was that the firm sees incredible path to sustained earnings growth, ROE expansion and a $7 earnings goal, which is really, in my mind and at least the perceived mind of many investors, the foundation for your case to remain a standalone after considering the strategic alternatives. And so since that update, clearly a lot of things have changed. Organic growth has slowed. We have the earnings and -- earnings declines really driven by rate headwinds, commission cuts.","So all in all, I guess taking a step back, it would suggest to us that the case to remain a standalone company has weakened. And just given those developments, how has your thinking and that of the Board really changed since the October update, particularly around your willingness to consider some of these strategic alternatives again?","Michael Pizzi","Yes, Steven. Thanks for the question. The environment certainly has changed. Interest rates are much lower, roughly 100 basis points or so across the yield curve. While the increased volatility from some of the market events this quarter drove active engagement from our derivative and trading base, you are seeing some degree of longer-term investors reduce risk and move to the sidelines a bit. While we did not desire the move in commissions, it has removed really the final point of differentiation in the marketplace. And it substantially improves our competitive position, which we believe will accelerate growth over the near term.","We have the number one platform in the market, and it's now essentially free. We have a strong and front growing franchise, really the best platform overall in the market, unrivaled capabilities of derivatives and an unparalleled corporate services group. So we see a clear path to growth, Steven, and we still see that today. Going back to last October, we outlined very clearly a set of goals for that environment and that time that we thought were readily achievable. We were very transparent and provided uncommon view into the long-term value generation of the company.","Today, sitting here, we're doing the same thing, providing a transparent insight into what we think that we can generate as a company. But we're well aware that possible combination or alternatives could accelerate shareholder value. If that's the case, we remain open really to all discussions, as we always have been, around the direction that we should take to drive that value.","Steven Chubak","All right. Thanks, Mike. I certainly appreciate hearing about the openness of yourself and the Board to consider those opportunities to create the value -- or additional shareholder value. Just one 2-parter for me on expense. I was hoping to maybe unpack a little bit on what drove some of the elevated expense, which was up about 5% year-on-year this quarter on a clean basis, and just longer term, appreciate the commitment to cut expenses in 2020. But just given the updated targets contemplate high single-digit revenue growth and low single-digit sustained expense growth, if we enter a more challenging revenue backdrop beyond 2020, how should we think about expense flags? And is there room to actually cut expenses on a sustained basis over the next couple of years if that's required?","Michael Pizzi","Well, let me talk a little bit about the forward outlook, and then I'll turn it to Chad to talk about kind of the current year and the current quarter's operating expenses. We have made substantial investments in the past few years in our marketing area, in our technology area, in modernization efforts across the large footprint of the company, even in sort of the modernization of facilities. Much of that investment is behind us, and ongoing investment is really a matter of reprioritizing the portfolio of investment as projects roll off and new projects begin to get going.","So I feel very good that the expense cuts that we've discussed in the prepared remarks for next year really will not compromise investment in our business or investment in growth in any way. And I think we can be able to achieve that and drive that and deliver basically by reprioritizing, retiming, relooking at the portfolio of investment opportunities.","If there is continued degradation in the environment, can we go deeper? That's something that we'll have to look at as the environment evolves. So I think you always are constantly reoptimizing, constantly relooking at your overall expense base, looking at your portfolio of investment projects, your build versus run costs and constantly looking to reoptimize. We took the important facilities action in this period, and that's an ongoing consolidation that will deliver some expense saves going forward. It's things like that, that we'll always continue to look at, continue to evaluate what we're doing to really drive the best value for our owners.","Chad Turner","I think Mike said it well, Steven. Just to add a few comments. You asked about the year-over-year view. I wouldn't look at any given quarter in isolation just as it relates to a comparison. There can obviously be a bit of noise there. But Mike said it well around just our operating leverage and the investments we're making there, where we not only invest for growth on the top line but we also invest to make sure that we maintain that best-in-class operating leverage that we talk about in the industry.","That's a bit of what we've talked about even doing this year. So I think some of that would materialize going into next year. That's why we know that the operating margin framework that we've used in the past has not necessarily been helpful for you guys. And so that's where we thought it was most productive to give you an operating expense number around that $1.5 billion as guidance for next year to help you understand the dynamics of how we can grow while still maintaining discipline on the bottom line.","Operator","Next question is from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard Repetto","I guess the first question is on the stock loan. It looks like you, just like other players in the industry, had an excellent quarter. So I'm just trying to first get some color on what drove it. And it looks like -- and then did you incorporate -- what are you assuming in 4Q from stock loan? It looks like it contributed, by our calculation, 8 basis points or so or $0.04 in EPS, the upside quarter-to-quarter in stock loan.","Michael Pizzi","Look, very strong quarter in stock loan. To give you little color in terms of it, it's some very specific names that are well known. Beyond Meat was one of them. It's the larger group of Canada stocks. All of them are very -- fell into the hard-to-borrow category. As sort of institutional risk positions built, the hard-to-borrow rates for those stocks kept climbing all throughout the quarter. They're a little softer here going into the next quarter but still overall very robust levels. I'll let Chad speak to kind of the forecast and kind of the outperformance in the quarter.","Chad Turner","Rich, as we look forward, obviously, this revenue can be a bit unpredictable. So we'll evaluate that as you see IPOs going or some of this does correlate with the margin book, and so would identify that there. So yes, definitely, we're not assuming that these levels continue. So I would certainly highlight that. The second thing I would note just as a kind of back-of-the-envelope comment as well is not only did see this in the normal securities lending book but we also saw this through fully paid. So that's an initiative that we've talked about growing over time. That will never grow to a significant level given that it's for a smaller set of customers, but it is a place where we made meaningful investment of reaching out to our larger, more sophisticated customers with opportunities around a fully paid program. That has provided benefit as well in this quarter.","Richard Repetto","Yes. Okay. Because it did -- well, your guidance is 315 to 320 in the NIM. It looks like that was again 8 basis points or so. So I'm just trying to reconcile that. But anyway, on to my next question. And Mike, with all due respect, just to be blunt, I mean I think it's debatable on how open, I guess, E*TRADE was a year ago to consolidation. So my direct question would be, today, compared to 12 months ago, are you more open, the same or less open to consolidation?","Michael Pizzi","Rich, I think it would be not really responsible to comment specifically around M&A. We are always open to look at transactions that will deliver more value for our shareholders than sort of a standalone performance of our business. We remain open to it today.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The next question is from Devin Ryan from JMP Securities.","Devin Ryan","I guess first question here, if possible to maybe go a little bit deeper into maybe some of those revenue opportunities that you noted that could exist around being at 0. And I'm just curious if you're thinking about potentially charging a la carte for any services or even a subscription model or I guess really what you're thinking around that. And also appreciate you have very little data yet on being at 0, but any anecdotes you can share around maybe people wanting to try the platform for free or anything interesting on engagement just post that change?","Michael Pizzi","Yes. Sure, Devin. On the revenue opportunity side, the way to think about it is we have always taken a modeled approach of giving everything to all customers, the full capability and suite of the platform. What that means really, it's not so much on the revenue side as much as we are incurring cost for every account for services and features that customers do not use or do not put value on. A good example of that is the high level of market data access we provide free of charge to just about all our customers. Look, many customers don't use it and would use -- would take a lesser offering without looking to what we're providing today. There are other areas in terms of tools, screeners, other items.","And so we can consolidate cost by customizing what we give to each customer. We're not really set up today to do that immediately, but over time, it allows us flexibility sort of in our overall expense structure by reducing portions in the offer that are really not important to that particular customer and reduce our overall usage of services that we pay quite a lot of expense for. A free model makes us really have to look at that. That's really coming on the expense side.","In terms of other revenue opportunities, we are always asking ourselves, are there ways to add adjacent services, adjacent products or optimizations or things. And maybe some of those things that we would be adding that would differentiate us in the past were offered to differentiate the price point we were at in the market versus other participants whereas today they could become the basis of alternative models. It's obviously early days and we've got a lot of strategy work to do here, but it's all out there for consideration.","Devin Ryan","Okay. Great. And then just kind of drilling down a little bit more into expenses. You touched on a couple of areas where maybe there's some expense savings. But just bigger picture, can you maybe go a little bit deeper around where the expense reductions are going to come from or where you can get leaner? How much does being at 0 change kind of innovation in the industry? I guess do people continue to invest in pushing platforms towards innovation? Or does this stifle that just given the kind of lower profitability from each customer all else equal? And then just lastly on expenses, the guidance for next year, does that -- what does that imply for advertising? I apologize, if I missed that.","Michael Pizzi","Look, we have always had a great and capable platform. We have the best platform in the derivative space today. We are #1. We are not going to stop improving our platform. It is a source of strength and growth for us in key portions of our business. Even with commissions going to 0, trading is still a very profitable business. As I highlighted in the prepared remarks, option trades are still strategically important to the company and really the source of most of transaction revenue remaining in the industry.","So looking at overall, we're not really going to be pulling back. Now that said, how you invest in what you choose to invest in and how you prioritize that investment will shift over time to areas that have the highest value. And this is a change in that value equation. But by no means are we going to pull back on our product or our service offering, which we see as real differentiators for us in the marketplace.","In terms of kind of some of the more technicals on the expense side, I'll turn it over to Chad.","Chad Turner","Sure. So a couple -- a few areas I talked about in my prepared remarks are around vendor negotiations. Prior to October, we were already actively moving towards cost containment initiatives internally to make sure that we could effectively maneuver around the landscape and what was happening in the overall macro environment. That only intensified further post-October. I think an event like the commission reduction that is widely publicized in the press is a prime opportunity for us to make sure that we're talking to our vendors in a very direct way around the products and services we are providing via them and how they can help us be more efficient in some of those. So I think that's an example there.","Mike mentioned New York consolidating into New Jersey and the collaborative nature that, that will provide for those offices working together. As it relates to the expense for that, we'll incur about a $10 million charge in Q4 we expect around that exit. But that will generate around $5 million annually in savings. So you can see that as a prime example of a really quick payback on something that we're doing. So there's lots of tactical examples like that.","Part of the reason, Devin, that we gave the $1.5 billion and not specifics, whether it be around marketing or other areas, is we are dynamically moving and making our budget now, our strategic plan for next year. Obviously, the commission impact, as Mike mentioned, is helping us evaluate where we're making those investments maybe a bit differently. So marketing is one of those lenses that we look at. Should the environment give us the returns we want in marketing, that would be a place we would actively invest. Should we believe they're not there due to the overall environment, that will be a place we would pull back as well.","Operator","Next question is from Will Nance with Goldman Sachs.","William Nance","Maybe I'll ask one about the balance sheet strategy. So I think I'm on board with the capital dynamics for the off balance sheet strategy. But I guess the resulting impact on the duration of your client cash pushes you farther and farther towards the short end of the curve. And I guess we've seen most of your competitors going the other direction to extend duration, whether that's on or off balance sheet. So I guess can you help us understand why going shorter on the duration curve makes sense right now given what the forward curve is implying for short-term rates?","Michael Pizzi","Well, we have always approached investing our own balance sheet cash to match the duration profile of the liability. We've always talked about our sweep liabilities and sort of the overall 4-year range and have invested them on balance sheet accordingly. When we moved in Q3 to move money off balance sheet, the right thing to do from an overall return dimension was to leave some of the off balance sheet in shorter term or closer to short rate type placements to third-party banks, giving us maximum flexibility to move the cash back if we want to or to move it out the curve into more fixed rate type agreements. At the time, that was not the compelling thing to do. It's still not to do right now. And our model contemplates bringing some of that cash back on balance sheet as the yield curve steepens.","Chad Turner","The 250 that we're quoting is a duration equivalent, right? That 3- to 4-year -- you think of our sweep duration being in that 3- to 4-year duration, that 250 would be -- if you were growing your balance sheet today, if the math of capital accretion determine that you would do that, that would be what you'd get in a duration-equivalent basis.","William Nance","Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe one more on some of the moving pieces on the margin. So I think by my math, in order just to hit kind of the high end of the range, you need to see a pretty sizable fall-off in the margin in the fourth quarter. So could you just help us bridge the gap. Understanding that the jumping off point from the stockpile was probably a little bit lower than what you printed today, just what are some of the moving pieces that kind of get us into that lower range? And is there any kind of opportunity to outperform that?","Chad Turner","Yes. You're right on the stock loan piece in that we don't assume that it reoccurs at that level. So that would certainly be one. I would also note that the guidance we give articulates that we would continue to move deposits off-balance sheet. So any additional, whether it be additional deposits we get would move off with the reinvestment rate we talked about there, also any paydowns we have in the portfolio, those would move off.","And so we're guiding being a bit more capital-light and shrinking the balance sheet in the quarter. So that's going to put a bit of impact on the revenue side. As it relates to expenses, there are a little bit of -- there's a bit of onetime in there around some of the cost containment initiatives. I talked about the New York piece being $10 million. There may be some other items in there that would also drive that a bit lower.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Next question is from Christian Bolu with Autonomous Research.","Chinedu Bolu","Just a follow-up on the comments around being open to a potential combination. Is the thinking still that a potential buyer has to underwrite the $7 EPS number for it to be interesting to the management team?","Michael Pizzi","Christian, I think what we've seen is the volatility of interest rate, the movement in commissions to 0 has created a degree of volatility in the businesses. I would say that there is significant upside to plans if interest rates were to move higher. There is downside if interest rates were to move materially lower, even though the term rates are really kind of at the lower end of historical trading areas. I think we have to think about what the combination looks like, what value it drivers for our owners, how that really comes together and what the overall value proposition is. It's not about underwriting a specific EPS number in a plan. It's about what value it drives in the combination.","Chinedu Bolu","Okay. Makes sense. And then, Mike, as you referenced in your prepared remarks, like the competitive landscape has meaningfully changed potentially to your benefit. But it doesn't sound like the strategy has changed, right? So how do you balance the opportunity to be more aggressive in growing the business, potentially increase your share of voice but just trying to hold expenses very tightly to sort of meet these EPS targets?","Michael Pizzi","Well, what we know today is our competitive position is substantially improved. We can look back in our data and see where we have lost customers, whether it was to a free offering or to a lower price point competitor or to any special promotion a competitor was running. And we can compare kind of where we stand today, free in our platform. We have actively engaged in a win back. You've seen some of our advertising out in the marketplace. We want to take advantage of the improvement in our competitive position.","It's early yet, but we are seeing a lot of anecdotal stories and evidence of win back some customers, customers coming back to use the platform and to engage with us, option customers coming in to have gained access to the platform, although they were small -- some of those were much more smaller-size customers, but really taking advantage of breadth of capability that we have. At the highest level, we are seeing a great increase in the number of hits on our prospect page. And that is translating into an acceleration in account openings.","But it's very early. And so we have to see if this is going to be sustained. All of that than needs to be factored in into our marketing plan and what we can really deliver from an overall marketing level and what the return on that spend is. So it's a little bit early to give any exact specifics of how we would optimize that, but that's exactly the work we're doing today.","Operator","Next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","So looking at the walk from $3.10 to $6 and $7 in 2023 and 2024, it looks like you need about an 18% earnings per share CAGR to get there. And so what I'm curious is if there -- do you guys have a period of time you could point to where you had earnings growth that was comparable to that, particularly at a time when we had an environment where you've got rates going against you rather than going with you? I'm just trying to understand -- because I'm struggling a little bit with what you guys model and kind of getting that level of earnings growth. And so hoping you can help shed a little light on some of the other factors involved with the model.","Michael Pizzi","Yes. Sure. Let me start with a couple. I mean the first one we talked about, we're not taking the commission cuts lying down. We've redoubled our efforts on the expense front. I think we've given you some pretty strong expense guidance for next year. That's an ongoing effort to try and drive to those results overall. We think there are some revenue side opportunities here, as I was just talking about, in terms of the overall level of growth. Some of that, I think, will be quick in terms of the pickup in growth that we're seeing given the capability and breadth of our platform and the price point that it's at now in the marketplace.","In addition to that, we talked about an investment in financial consultant headcount. The payback on those is pretty clear to me. And that's why we've been moving those numbers up, and we'll continue to move those numbers up. That drives both investments in asset builds, but it also improves cash.","Additionally, our corporate services channel has grown tremendously. It's exceeded even our own lofty expectations. We have $21 billion of plan assets put on this year, $5 billion in the quarter alone, generating $30 billion of proceeds. We've really looked carefully at those numbers and the cash generation capabilities of those business, looked going forward what we think we're going to be able to do and modeled out the value of the growth over the last couple of quarters to really show what that does to our asset build and more specifically our cash build.","And lastly, we've looked carefully at what we've done in the banking sector, what we're doing in sort of the savings deposit type products. We are at a good rate in the marketplace today, but we don't have to be at the best rate. And we're showing solid growth in our banking products as well. And we are still working on modernizing and building out the user experience. So putting that all together, we think we can drive substantial earnings growth over the period.","Chad Turner","Brennan, one thing I would add just -- is at the front end of the plan, a reminder that as of the end of the quarter, we have almost $12 billion of sweep deposits that are off balance sheet. Those are our deposits now that with the generation of capital in a very short period of time can be on boarded. And so when you think about the revenue build at the front end and the EPS generation that, that can create when the curve normalizes and steepens a bit and our assumptions we laid out, that gives you a tremendous amount of growth upfront.","Brennan Hawken","Sure. Sure. I get that, and that makes a lot of sense. And thanks for all that additional color. I really appreciate it. For my follow-up, it's my understanding that -- number 1, it's my understanding that in the corporate services business that the commission rates paid is sort of a dynamic that there's an interplay in between the platform fees and the commission rate paid and there's a sort of menu pricing that's available. And so that can result in commission per trade but skews away from your guys overall commission rates. And so since that's a menu pricing, the trading and the commission rates on your corporate services business wouldn't necessarily move with the rack rate. Number 1, I just want to confirm that, that's true. And number 2, if those commission rates in your corporate services business stay higher than your rack, does that provide like an incentive for you to retain some more customers, have them transfer over, become E*TRADE customers, increase that 15% because there's almost like a natural incentive for them to switch over for the better commission pricing?","Michael Pizzi","Yes. The initial first trade out of the stock plan, the commission on that is negotiated with the plan sponsor when they elect to use us. There's lots of different value elements there. There is what they pay for the software. We offer specialized consulting services, outsourced services that they choose to pay sometimes in a bespoke way. Sometimes they want it wrapped up in the fee they pay for the software. They also are aware kind of the commission level is a value to us. So it enters into the overall equation, as you've kind of talked about it.","So the value is really different for each client in terms of what they need from us and how they engage. Whenever commissions come into focus like this, there is some pressure on those commissions to make sure that they are close to the overall level of commissions that are being offered in the marketplace. We've seen some of that pressure overall. But by and large, these are individual plan levels that are negotiated.","In terms of just the retention side, we think -- I mean the stock plan business is a wide business. There's a lot of higher-income level employees in the plan, but there are also just companies that give stock to everyone. So while I don't think it will be an incredible shift, the 0 commission on the platform today may mean more of the smaller stock plan participants do open an account and stay with us in the long term. So I'm optimistic that, yes, it will have an impact in account retention, maybe not -- it doesn't -- maybe it will not total much in the assets, but it probably means more accounts for us and more customer activity.","Operator","Next question is from Dan Fannon from Jefferies.","Daniel Fannon","I guess a follow-up on the corporate services business. Are you assuming in your outlook that the 15% retention improves then from where it has been for, I guess, the sustained period recently? And if so, kind of what are the factors that gives you confidence around that?","Michael Pizzi","Yes. We don't model sustained improvement in the 15%. That would be upside to the modeled estimates. We did look at a little bit of the bank flows from this year, and we do think that is driving some of our savings deposit inflows and the strength of that we model for those in the long run plan. But we don't take up the 15% appreciably.","Chad Turner","And Dan, the only thing -- one comment I would add there would be around the implementations we've seen to date, right? So as Mike mentioned in his prepared remarks, we have exceeded even our most lofty goals internally with $21 billion of implementations to date. That obviously generates a significant amount of stock plan assets that results in cash. So that's something we've looked at in the model around the last few years, seeing that dislocation and the win rate that we've had there and the amount that we brought in the plan, that has increased that view in the out-years. We noted that on the slide around why we think that's going to provide a bit of an outsize growth rate versus core retail there. So that would definitely be something to think about as you model it.","Daniel Fannon","Okay. That's helpful. And then just with regards to the advisory services, can you put some numbers around the number of advisers that are coming on the platform? Or I think you talked about increased engagement with prospective adviser. Any numbers around backlog or anything that we could think about in terms of sizing that?","Michael Pizzi","Yes. We've increased the number of advisers on the platform in this period by about 20. That's just the natural advisers coming on that we're adding overall on the platform. But we've also signed some much larger national advisers that want to participate in our referral program. In the case of those, the number is not meaningful. The sizes are very large, and the flows that they control are also very large. We've talked about some of them in the past. That is a lot to do with the technology work that we're doing right now to make sure that we've got the seamless type of integration for the larger advisers and that the platform of liberty, which is the E*TRADE Advisor Services platform, seamlessly integrates to E*TRADE middle and back office so that it can be essentially seamlessly scaled as we grow this business.","Operator","Next question is from Craig Siegenthaler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler","So just coming back to the $6 EPS target, how do you factor in future pricing pressure across your other fee streams? And then also, how do you think about further dilution to your ROCA ex spread revenues over the next 4 years? Because I'm imagining -- you don't give it to us, but imagine there is actually a pretty wide spread between your AUA target and then the revenue guidance you gave us?","Chad Turner","Craig, so first off, just as it relates to commission revenue, for example, Mike talked a bit about the stock plan side and some of the decompression there. We do assume a moderate bit of that continuing on the commission side. So not to the level obviously of what happened in October but consistent with what he talked about before, a little bit of erosion there.","As it relates to cash in general, I would just note that we frankly believe that we have a cash-generating machine that is really second to none, right, whether it's the corporate services business, the channel that Mike just talked about and everything that's generated there or the core retail business that is low-cost deposits, right, the best deposit franchise out there just around customers that are not meaningfully looking for yield, right? We continue to see that. This quarter was a prime example of that.","If you use this quarter as a microcosm for cash growth for the firm, we've always talked about in a normalized net buy\/sell environment, right, over the last few years, you've seen significant buying at record levels that has put pressure on cash growth. This quarter, we had net selling just to a minor amount, and you can see that we brought in $3 billion of cash growth in the quarter from our customers. So we're not assuming net selling out over the period. We're just assuming that we have normal customer growth coming in through growth in our business that generates cash into the firm that can be generated -- that can be invested at a reasonable spread.","As it relates to rates, we do assume a couple of Fed cuts in the plan, as we outlined it. And then just follow the forward curve for reinvestment.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks. And just as my follow-up here. Now that the commission-free ETF platforms have essentially ended, will any of the third-party ETFs on your platform, which is all of them, still use shelf user rev shares in 4Q or 1Q post the commission cuts?","Chad Turner","Craig, that's something we're still working through. It's a good question. And something that we're working through. I don't think it's very significant as far as impact to us, but it's something we're still working through.","Operator","Next question is from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Harris","So it looks like the yield you guys earned on off balance sheet customer cash went up sequentially quarter-on-quarter. A little bit of a surprise because the Fed funds went down. What drove that?","Chad Turner","Chris, the yield actually went down. So in Q2, the gross yield on the sweep deposits, so that's before any deposit cost, was 2.63. It went down to 2.44 this quarter with the Fed cuts. And the guidance we gave is that it will go down to 1.95. So it does follow -- it does broadly follow short rates. The only thing I would note is, and we mentioned this a bit on the Q2 call, is that with the significant amount that we were moving off balance sheet post the $4.5 billion sale in Q2, it does give you an opportunity to negotiate a bit more with some of the third-party banks that are looking for blocks of liquidity. And so we do see that a bit where our ability to earn a little bit more of a spread of off short rates from some of those providers reach through a bit. But it did go down by just under 20 basis points in the quarter.","Christopher Harris","All right. So maybe I can try to ask in a different way. If I look at just that revenue line item, money market funds and sweep deposit revenue, it tripled sequentially but the balances didn't tripled. So I guess I'm having a hard time squaring why the revenues were up that much relative to the balances growth.","Michael Pizzi","Yes. Chris, I think because if you go back far enough, the proportion that's money funds is larger. As we're moving sweep deposits off balance sheet and growing deposits off balance sheet, the sweep deposit rate is the higher rate. It's taking the weighted average rate up against the backdrop of the Feds that's cutting. The Fed cut doesn't hurt the rev share on the money funds, but it does bring the sweep rate back down.","Chad Turner","And the message, Chris, would be to take the $4.5 billion, for example, that we moved off at the end of last quarter, if you just apply that average rate for the quarter to it. And then we moved another $2 billion off this quarter, taking whatever, taking the average of $1 billion for the quarter there, I think you'll be able to get to just the marginal math of the change in that line item for the quarter.","Operator","Next question is from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","Okay. Following off of a previous question, how do you think about future disruptive pricing actions that competitors might take in terms of your EPS outlook? So if somebody were to eliminate the options for contract fee or maybe somebody would start rebating [indiscernible] revenue to their clients and you guys -- you had to match for competitive [indiscernible], how do you -- can you still achieve your new targets in an environment where you had direct like that?","Michael Pizzi","Look, the substantial amount of transaction revenue that's left, Patrick, is related to option pricing and our corporate services business. Now what I will say about option customers that's a bit different than equity and ETF customers is the platform truly matters to them. It is the tool set by which they're finding their trade opportunities, the ability to execute complex order types. They are your more sophisticated traders. Superior execution quality matters to them. So it's not about payment or free. It's about where they're getting filled at on a complex option order. They also are extensive users of your risk management tools, your strategy seek that I mentioned in my prepared remarks.","We look at it from -- we are helping the customers identify the trade opportunity, execute the trade opportunity in the most efficient, straightforward way given the ability to execute complex order types and to manage complex positions once they have them on. So there is a premium that can be maintained in the option space. Obviously, we would have to assess whatever competitor it was. There are platforms that are closer to ours in capability. And there are platforms that are clearly -- just clearly not there.","So in options, I think it would depend on what really moved. Order flow on, I think, individual trade, well, that's a tough concept to really talk about because a lot of it is driven on volumes or other numbers. So how do you map that all back could get very cumbersome. So I think that there is -- while there could be some additional disruption, I don't think we're going to see much of it.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","Got it. That's helpful. And for my follow-up. You mentioned a couple of times that moving to $0 commissions eliminates a competitive disadvantage for E*TRADE. As we look at the Top 2 charts in Slide 14, your net new retail and adviser services asset growth and your account growth, and certainly we've seen a slowdown -- a pretty significant slowdown in 2019. Would you say that some of that slowdown is because of that competitive disadvantage that you've been in terms of commissions?","Michael Pizzi","Look, I think that on an account side, I think you can look at kind of younger customers who have been looking more at free platforms. So I would say smaller accounts, certainly, there's been a competitive effect. For the smaller, less sophisticated new entrant to trading, they are trying the free platforms first. So I think on the account side, there has certainly been an effect. I think we are in a great position to recapture that into our growth today given the competitive shift that's happened.","On the asset side, I think we had strong asset flows for a while. I do think we are seeing the resultant effect of very high degrees of volatility in the marketplace around the events that in some ways are not even macroeconomic related to some degree, whether it's impeachment, whether it's geopolitical risk in the Middle East or other events that caused the market to move, it takes core investors and get them to move to the sideline a bit and sort of diminished interest in investment overall until we move past these type of market environments.","Chad Turner","Patrick, one comment on the account side that I think is important that we didn't cover in our prepared remarks. So for the quarter, the net new retail account, it was impacted by some Cap One attrition that was broadly in line with expectation. So as a reminder, we acquired a closed block of accounts of just under $1 million. In the quarter, there were about 20,000 accounts that attrited from that population or inactivated from that population. That population was fairly low-value accounts at acquisition. So not higher-value accounts that we have retained. The balances and all the activity of Capital One is performing at or better than we expected. But that is something to highlight just as it relates to the account metric for the quarter.","Operator","Next question is from Kyle Voigt with KBW.","Kyle Voigt","Maybe just a follow-up on Patrick's question. Something on the competitive environment. Just wondering. You described it on the option side. But do you believe that the heightened competitive pressures in the industry that were previously concentrated on the commission side of the business will now begin to migrate and kind of seep into these other revenue streams, so towards brokerage pay rates or proprietary asset management products or something else? And then I guess when you're looking at the industry and you look at your offering versus the other 3 larger players, I guess what do you see as the key differentiator for the average retail users, so maybe not so much traditionally the active trader platform, what's the differentiator for E*TRADE?","Michael Pizzi","Yes. Sure. On the first point, I think you raised an obvious point that you're going to target your user promotions to the things that generate the best revenue capacity. That said, I would just keep in mind that an active option trading customer is still an excellent customer even with the commission change. And I don't think you'll see any -- you won't see us and you probably won't see any of our competitors stop competing aggressively for that business. Trading even across the equity products still generates cash. It generates order flow. It generates all of the characteristics that continue to drive revenue overall. So it's still something that you're going to pursue.","But obviously, you're going to tailor your efforts around promotions, around sort of what you're doing to try to attract that customer to the products that generate the best return overall. And this has changed the landscape quite a bit. So we have to sort of -- we're still doing that work and still carefully thinking how we're going to change. But we think this offers up -- it creates a number of advantages for us in the marketplace of where we are at an improved competitive position and continue to drive at that improved competitive position to overall drive growth.","On the second side, I think we've put a lot of work into our investing platform over the last couple of years. The user experience is better than ever on our robo, on our other managed products largely distributed through our FCs. We've seen customers drive, pull in more assets and consolidate relationships with us as we build out those relationships over time. So we are seeing really the payoff of that. I can't point to a better outcome than the Kiplinger survey rating us #1. That's a long-standing survey that really looks at the investment capability of your platform and what you're offering your customers.","Operator","Next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Maybe just to come back to the M&A discussion. I appreciate your answer earlier about being just open to ideas. If you -- first of all, you obviously need to think about some of the risks that could impede the ability to get to $6 that are outside of your control mostly, mostly rates and other competitive moves. You balance that against potential combinations. Does it make a big difference? You mentioned value creation for shareholders. Does it make a big difference for you to consider something that would be an in-market consolidation versus combining with someone outside of the online brokerage industry and broadening out the consumer financial platform and then, of course, E*TRADE being a part of that growth business as opposed to being subject to cost cuts with an in-market transaction?","Michael Pizzi","Yes. Brian, look, I'm not going to get specific about any particular transaction or style. I think all of the -- most of you have published merger models in the past that focused on consolidation-type transactions. I would say your question and the point you're making in the question is a very valid one. With 7 million accounts and roughly that many customers and really the touch points we have broadly across financial services, our corporate stock plan business is a strategic deal of the better deal. I'm not going to speculate on that except to say that obviously, we bring a lot of strategic value, including the most epic brand in financial services today.","Brian Bedell","Okay. Fair enough. And then just a housekeeping back to the -- you mentioned the possibility of moving the savings account off balance sheet. Can you just touch again on the timing of that and then the economics of how that would change it?","Michael Pizzi","Yes. From an economic side, it's more flexibility. It gives us the ability to optimize versus the sweep program, what cash is off, what cash is on. If the investment environment is there and it's the best thing to do to have it all along, we can easily do that. If it's not, we can begin to optimize and move those positions. So think about it as a tool that allows us to continue to grow those savings deposits over time without losing any capital flexibility for our balance sheet.","Chad Turner","And Brian, that flexibility will be available towards the end of the year.","Brian Bedell","Okay. And would it be something that would be a onetime move or just as you see fit over time?","Chad Turner","I think Mike mentioned how we would do it, right, just how we make the overall duration of the portfolio, what we think is the best use of capital. So it would not be something that is -- it would be something that would just be a tool on our toolbox to manage our balance sheet.","Operator","Next question is from Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier","Just a quick one. Just in the updated $6 target, just focusing on the upper single-digit revenue growth target, I guess can you explain with the NIM compression -- and then when I think about the net new asset growth being around 2% versus that target, if you make money on client asset -- client assets or activity levels, like how can you get, say, like a three multiple on that organic growth rate to get to like a revenue growth rate without either pricing power or a big shift until like advice?","Michael Pizzi","Well, look, we have, and I think we've demonstrated it so you can see some of the impact of it in the quarter, a significant ability to grow cash. And that comes from a number of areas. The things that are sort of -- that are new, and we talked about them in the prepared remarks, how we're thinking about it is we've upped our investment overall in financial consultants considerably. That drives increased asset flows. That drives increased cash. We've taken sort of the growth rate in corporate services that has occurred. That growth is already here. It's already booked on our platform. But we've taken that out to say what is that growth worth in cash generation as we begin to move forward.","Putting that all together, that's really kind of the key revenue driver along with the other revenue streams in our modeled approach. And we think that there's going to be, as we've already talked about, a degree of lift from the improvement in competitive position to overall activity.","Operator","And our last question is from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.","Michael Cyprys","Mike, so it's been about a year since you guys concluded your strategic review and introduced new targets and since, I mean, you've had time to assess and talk to shareholders and incremental owners. So I guess just realizing the environment has changed versus a year ago and your targets have changed, I'm just curious what lessons you and your management team take away from the past 12 months.","Michael Pizzi","Well, look, I think the commission change that we've seen in the market, we looked at and hoped that most competitors would have learned the lessons of 2017 that you really can't gain share, that everyone has the ability to adjust, can adjust and would this day would not come for that reason. What we've seen is irrational moves can happen. They happened in 2017 and they happened again last month -- sorry, this month. So one thing to think about is the unexpected and what that drives.","But that said, commissions were never a source of growth in our modeling approach. We had always seen -- we always model a degree of erosion due to the competition. So they were not really driving growth. They were really kind of almost a constant. As volumes went up, we eroded CPT. So the growth potential of our model was never hinged on what happened with commissions. It drove from all the other factors in our business. I think the results were show -- the plan we're showing today and the results of this quarter really show that quite clearly.","Michael Cyprys","Great. And just a quick follow-up on the rate environment, which continues to come in worse than I guess many would have thought a year ago. So I guess the question is just if rates go to zero, how should we think about the impact to NIM. And I see in your disclosure, you have the 25 basis point cut is worth 6 basis points. So I just simply multiply that across and it looks like the NIM maybe comes down to like 280 area or so. But we need take to into account the portfolio rolling over. So I was just hoping you can help us flush out kind of what's reasonable lower bound. If I look back, say, 2014 looked like it bottomed around 230. Is that a reasonable level for a 0 rate environment? Or should it be a little bit lower or higher? How should we be thinking about that?","Michael Pizzi","Look, it really depends -- it not just totally depends on whether the funds rate goes to 0 again. It also depends on what term rates do. We've been getting a lot of questions around kind of more scenarios where we would see unprecedented lows in 10-year rates or things like that. It really depends. And so that's why we've given you essentially 9 scenarios of twists and shape changes. For reasonable extensions or small movement increases, those are somewhat linear, but they can become nonlinear as you kind of move either lower and lower or higher and higher in rates. So I think that's why we provide that detail so that you can make those estimates.","Operator","There are no further questions. I'll turn the call back to you.","Michael Pizzi","All right. Thanks, everyone, for joining us and look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude your conference call for today. We thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect."],"7963":["E*TRADE Financial Corp.

Please go ahead.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Scott. Good evening and thank you for joining us. During the quarter, we posted healthy brokerage metrics with robust asset accumulation, and the team delivered enhancements to our service offerings, earning some welcomed recognition along the way, with all of this aimed at meeting our commitment to do more for our customers.","Permit me to begin with our capital plan since I recognize that it stands as a topic of more than passing interest to many of you. We entered 2015 with coronets (1:55) welcoming some key approvals from our regulators. These approvals underscored E*TRADE's progress across a number of fronts and ultimately facilitated the company's reduction of corporate debt to our target level.","This represented a major milestone for our enterprise as we continue down the path of driving value for our owners. On last quarter's call, we announced the approval to move out our two broker-dealers from under the bank. In February, we completed the move of E*TRADE Securities, our introducing broker. Our plan remains on track to move the Clearing broker in the second half of the year as we work through the intricacies of that transaction. Matthew will provide more details later.","In conjunction with the move of our introducing broker, $434 million of capital become available to the parent, which we used to achieve the goal of reducing corporate debt to $1 billion. The most-recent transaction brings our cumulative debt reduction to $740 million, which we completed in just four months. Looked at from another perspective, in the time since the company first submitted its capital plan in 2012, debt service costs have been reduced by more than 70% to just $50 million.","Our three credit rating agencies have recognized these achievements with a total of eight full-notch upgrades over the past 12 months, including three in conjunction with the March debt transaction. Each upgrade is encouraging as we continue to make strides towards our goal of becoming investment grade. With debt reduction behind us, we turn our focus to how we will next put our capital to work.","For the first time in more than five years, we have a meaningful direct source of capital generation at the parent in the form of our introducing broker-dealer. And with our organizational realignment, clarity on bank capital ratios and plans to continue requesting quarterly dividends from the bank, we are in an attractive position when it comes to putting more capital to work for our shareholders. With significant opportunities in front of us, we are evaluating how to most appropriately and effectively put capital to use.","Turning to results, excluding the early extinguishment of debt charge, we recorded earnings of $0.29 per share for the quarter on an income of $85 million. Our results were driven by solid customer engagement, including record high margin loan balances, lower-than-expected provision and a benefit to corporate interest expense from our March debt transaction. DARTs for the quarter were just shy of $170,000, up slightly from the prior quarter, but down 14% from last year's unusual buoyant Q1.","Options represented approximately 23% of total trading activity, in line with trends over the past couple of years. We've seen a pullback in activity in April to-date with DARTs tracking down 6% from March. Margin balances grew by approximately $500 million to end the quarter to record $8.2 billion. Balances dipped at the beginning of the year, which is reflected in the quarterly average of $7.9 billion, but steadily rebounded in the latter half of the quarter.","Our customers were net buyers of $3.1 billion of securities in the quarter, continuing the multiyear trend of customers putting their money to work. We added 39,000 net new brokerage accounts in Q1, up from 17,000 in the prior quarter, but down from 72,000 a year ago, which was a five-year record. Attrition of 8.8% improved from 9.1% in the prior quarter. Net new brokerage assets of $3.5 billion represented annualized growth of 5.7%. This matched our asset gatherings from the prior quarter, but was down from a record $4.1 billion one year ago.","This asset gathering is encouraging, especially when you consider the type of assets customers are bringing to E*TRADE. Becoming known as a trusted place for investors to build their financial health is central for us. And we have devoted much time and energy to that side of the business. As a measure of our success, roughly one-fourth of our net new assets in the quarter were in retirement accounts. We closed out retirement season strong ending Q1 with nearly $50 billion in retirement assets, up 11% from last year.","A key component of growth here is advice-based solutions and we're encouraged by how these assets continue to perform. Assets in managed accounts reached $3.2 billion this quarter, up an impressive 24% from a year ago. We also continued our steady drumbeat of customer-driven digital enhancements. These included making it easier for our customers to manage taxes related to their investments, creating an even better experience for our most-active traders and delivering more functionality to already leading mobile platform.","A new tax center delivers a more intuitive and helpful experience by centralizing tax documents and better positioning resources and education for cost-based reporting, gains and losses and tax-efficient investing. We also made multiple improvements to E*TRADE Pro, our platform for active traders, including tax lot trading, pattern day trading enhancements and order entry updates, which when taken together deliver more customized, intuitive and hassle-free experience for our most-active customers.","With a record 13% of our total DARTs placed through our mobile application this quarter, we continue to fortify our position as a leader in mobile trading and investing, adding multi-leg options functionality, employee stock plan trading and stock alerts, to name a few. Just weeks ago, we announced a meaningful step forward in the wearable space with our app for the Apple Watch. The Apple delivers essential market data in an engaging and simple format to help investors and traders monitor their portfolios, watch lists and the markets. It also includes handoff functionality that delivers a seamless transition from watch to phone.","Our continuous improvements in leading-edge technology offerings are not going unnoticed as we've received a number of accolades from well-recognized external sources. Barron's rated us four out of five stars in their Annual Online Broker Survey, scoring high marks in research amenities and customer service and education. StockBrokers.com gave us three first-place awards; Number-One Smartphone App, Number One Client Dashboard and Best New Tool for E*TRADE Browser Trading in their 2015 Online Broker Review.","In the same review, we earned five best-in-class ratings for Offering of Investments, Investor Education, Research, Mobile Trading and New Investors. We were also recognized by Benzinga in their first-annual Fintech Awards for our Browser Trading web app. And lastly, I recognize that I run the risk of being ungracious and boring you when I talk about the importance of risk. And my sermon on the subject hasn't changed. We've built out these capabilities, we're running a world-class ERM department, and risk management is at the heart of everything we do.","To that end, I thought it was an opportune time to have our distinguished Chief Risk Officer, Michael Pizzi, join the call, before handing things off to our pellucid CFO, Matthew Audette. Over to you, Mr. Pizzi.","Michael A. Pizzi - Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer","Thank you, Mr. Idzik. I first want to first take a moment to talk about the central role risk management plays here at E*TRADE, and then I'll move into credit risk and an update on the legacy loan portfolio.","In 2012, we devoted significant focus to bolstering our enterprise risk management as a key component of our capital plan. At the time, we had prudent and strong financial risk management, but significant work remained to establish a fulsome operational risk framework. We looked to a number of outside experts for input and best practices and collectively determined that there was a need for much clearer and more robust governance, escalation and root cause analysis.","We have spent the past several years putting these systems and processes in place, in conjunction with building out robust and highly-credible stress testing capabilities, as well as making significant enhancements in third-party oversight, model risk management, ongoing risk assessment and monitoring. Our hard work has resulted in an enterprise risk management function that is consistent with that of much larger institutions.","In practice, our ERM framework consists of three lines of defense; the first line, the various lines of business within the company; the second line, the risk organization along with our colleagues in compliance and legal; and the third line, the internal audit group.","We have built a coverage model where each area of the company's business has a dedicated partner in the risk, legal and compliance areas. We have also worked to improve and develop the company's risk culture, having conducted workshops throughout the entire organization to ingrain risk management into the very fabric of our organization and to make sure each colleague knows they are risk owners within their respective areas. We have built a strong risk management culture, tying risk to performance measures down to the individual level.","In short, risk management is part of everything we do at E*TRADE. As you've heard Matt and Paul say before, the build out is key, but sustainability is critical. The latter is how I would characterize the phase we are in today, demonstrating the sustainability and effectiveness of the program we've worked so hard to install. And while I feel good about how far we have come, we will of course continue to fine tune our practices to evolve both with the operating and regulatory landscapes.","Now, on to credit risk management, an important, yet diminishing component of my role. The loan portfolio ended the quarter at $6.1 billion, down $317 million from the prior quarter. This was essentially all paid-outs, as charge-offs were flat to the prior quarter at just $7 million. We expect quarterly runoff of the portfolio to remain in the 4% to 5% range throughout 2015. Provision for loan losses was $5 million in the first quarter, down from $10 million in the prior period. Matt will give you more color around our provision expectations, but clearly this quarter was better than we anticipated.","As we navigate through the upcoming HELOC conversions throughout the remainder of this year and next, this will be the most-prominent variable in determining our provision expense. Thus far we have a very small sample of loans that have converted. They are generally our higher credit quality loans. And while they have largely performed more favorably than expected, it is very early days.","As we approach a more meaningful amount of conversions, we are working with our servicers on proactive borrower outreach and loss mitigation, where possible. Meanwhile our allowance ended the quarter relatively unchanged at $402 million. The reserve shifted slightly with an increase in the 1-4 family book and a decrease in home equity. The 1-4 reserves increased $4 million to $31 million, home equity reserves declined $7 million to end the quarter at $360 million.","The decline related to better-than-expected performance following a planned servicer transfer, for which we previously booked reserves. The transfer took place in February and is also the driving force behind the increase in early-stage delinquencies this quarter. We also had a planned servicer transfer in the 1-4 portfolio, which drove an associated increase in early-stage delinquencies. However, we did not recognize reserves for this transfer as 1-4 loans typically self-correct, whereas the cure rate for home equity is much lower.","So, in summary, credit risk is becoming a smaller issue with each passing quarter and we are proud of the progress we have made to become an institution known internally and externally as one that is serious about and committed to risk management.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Matt.","Matthew J. Audette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, distinguish Mike. We'd a pretty tremendous start to the year. After a multi-year effort, our corporate debt is now where it belongs. And on top of that, we posted strong operating results driven by a number of factors.","We reported first quarter net income of $85 million or $0.29 per share, excluding a $73 million pre-tax charge related to our corporate debt transaction. Excluding a similar charge of $59 million in the prior quarter, this compares to net income of $78 million or $0.26 per share and net income of $97 million or $0.33 per share in the year-ago quarter.","Net revenues of $456 million were down from $461 million in the prior quarter and $475 million in the year-ago quarter. Revenue included net interest income of $271 million, down $8 million from the prior quarter, as net interest spread contracted 7 basis points and our average assets increased approximately $200 million.","Although spread contracted sequentially, at 262 basis points, it was above our expectations as we once again benefited from elevated margin loan balances and strong securities lending results. After experiencing declines in both of these at the beginning of Q1, both trended upward in the second two months of the quarter. We also saw some spread compression as a result of a slight increase in prepayments and lower reinvestment rates on the securities portfolio.","In the second quarter to-date, rates continue to be challenging. If we hold today's environment constant, our net interest spread would be in the low to mid-250 basis point in the second quarter. Our balance sheet ended the quarter at $46.8 billion, up $1.3 billion from the prior quarter. We completed the conversion of our sweep deposits to a new platform during the quarter and began to put it to work in March, moving $1.25 billion of customer deposits held by third-party banks back on our balance sheet. With this new platform, we can much more efficiently move deposits on and off balance sheet giving us a powerful tool for managing balance sheet size.","We have converted approximately $15 billion of our $42 billion in brokerage customer cash to the new platform. Of that $15 billion that has converted, a little under $4 billion is held by third-party banks and a little over $11 billion is on our balance sheet. One component of our customer cash is money funds, where approximately $8 billion resides, largely as a result of our deleveraging efforts. We would ultimately like to move that portion into the sweep program as it has benefits for both us and the customer. It's a more lengthy process, involving system changes and customer consents, but we are working on it and will keep you posted.","With the rollout of the new sweep platform, we've determined that classifying the revenue generated from off balance sheet deposits in fees and service charges as opposed to net interest income is more consistent with how this type of revenue is generally presented within the industry. Accordingly, Q1 has about $5 million of reclassified revenue in this line, which is up from $4 million in the prior quarter and $3 million the year-ago quarter. For comparability purposes, prior periods have also been reclassified.","Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenue in the first quarter were $176 million, flat with the prior quarter and down 6% from the year-ago quarter. Average commission per trade of $10.94 increased $0.10 on the prior quarter and $0.30 from the year-ago period. The quarterly increase was driven by higher stock plan trading, while the year-over-year increase was driven by a more favorable options and customer mix. Fees and service charges revenues of $52 million included $23 million of payment for order flow, flat with the prior quarter.","Net gains on loans and securities were $9 million this quarter, up from $6 million in the prior quarter and in line with our expectations of $5 million to $10 million. We stated last quarter that if rates remain low, we would likely be at the high end of the range and that is exactly what you saw this quarter. Our operating expenses for the quarter were $300 million, up $6 million from the prior quarter, driven primarily by comp and ben, which reflected a seasonal increase. Our operating expenses for Q1 were well in line with our expectations and we are still planning for full-year 2015 expenses to increase in the low- to mid-single digits.","As Mike discussed, provision for the quarter was $5 million. Given what we have experienced and the healthy reserves we maintain, we are adjusting our expected provision range for this year to zero to $20 million per quarter, effectively expanding and lowering our prior range of $10 million to $20 million. Looking ahead to 2016, we are also adjusting our expectations, now forecasting provision to land at or above the top end of our current range. This is slightly improved from our prior range of $20 million to $30 million per quarter. However, I must caution the visibility into performance this far out is certainly limited, and we will adjust our expectations as we gain clarity. As Mike mentioned, HELOC conversions will be the most-important variable here. There's still only a small population of loans that have actually converted.","We will have more significant data throughout the year as there are approximately $500 million of loans that will convert over the course of the next three quarters. We will then have $900 million converting next year, after which this event will largely be behind us. We will certainly keep you apprised of any trends that we see in the performance of these loans.","Turning now to the capital plan, to re-emphasize what Paul said earlier, we've accomplished a lot in 2015 already. To recap the first quarter, we utilized $432 million of corporate cash to pay down $340 million of debt and refinanced another $460 million at 4.625%, the lowest coupon in the company's history, while extending our maturity profile by more than two years, with our nearest maturity now in 2022.","Debt reduction was a central goal of the capital plan, when we first laid it out in June of 2012. As we worked on our plans for a number of reasons, it became clear that $1 billion was the right amount. Now that we are sitting at $1 billion and with no more space on my shelf for dead (20:35) deal toys, it feels good to be done talking about debt reduction and focusing on what is next.","At the moment, we are working to ensure a smooth transition of our Clearing broker from under the bank. Since this entity has been under the bank, it has benefited from a shared surplus of capital and liquidity. As we prepare to move it out, we have to establish and formalize new lines of liquidity, even though these may ultimately remain undrawn.","In conjunction with this, we are also evaluating whether it makes sense to move additional capital into that entity. So, the bottom line is that until we determine how E*TRADE Clearing will be situated from a capital and liquidity standpoint, it is prudent to wait on further capital actions. As a reminder, we intend to move the entity in the second half of this year.","With the approval to manage the bank to a 9% Tier 1 leverage ratio, we ended the quarter nicely above that threshold, at 9.8%. The implementation of Basel III benefited that ratio by approximately 90 basis points. Keep in mind that this still includes E*TRADE Clearing and its existing capital and assets. Excluding it would have decreased our ratio by approximately 10 basis points. So, on a pro forma basis, we have approximately $240 million of capital in excess of our regulatory threshold at the bank.","As a reminder, we plan to request quarterly dividends from the bank to the parent equal to its prior quarter net income. In Q1, net income for the bank was $92 million. Also, during Q1, E*TRADE Securities generated approximately $50 million in excess capital, which we plan to move to the parent next week.","So, to echo Paul, we are in a position of strength when it comes to the capital available to us and we are very deliberately working through how to most appropriately put it to use. I don't have specifics for you today, but I would like to offer my thoughts on a few of the options. To start, under our new structure, we will have capital available for use at both the bank and the parent.","At the bank, we will have the ability to utilize capital in excess of our 9.0% Tier 1 leverage ratio. Our most-prominent options include balance sheet growth and the acceleration of legacy risk reduction, meaning potentially eliminating wholesale funding obligations ahead of schedule and selling the remainder of the loan portfolio. While neither of these actions are in our plans today, we are constantly assessing the path forward as it relates to legacy risks.","At the parent, we have the ability to utilize capital from the broker, plus the planned quarterly dividend requests equivalent to the bank's net income. Obvious uses include share buybacks, dividends and investing in the business where we see opportunity for healthy returns.","For a little more detail on these items, balance sheet growth is certainly an option, especially in a more attractive rate environment than the one we find ourselves in today. We ended the quarter with $46.8 billion of assets, up $1.3 billion from the prior quarter, which is largely the result of the implementation of our new sweep deposit program. So, we still have some room to utilize capital by growing the balance sheet, while staying below $50 billion, which remains our intention.","On wholesale funding, we ended the quarter at $4.6 billion, with $365 million scheduled to expire primarily in the second half of this year. The cost to eliminate these borrowings would be approximately $450 million pre-tax, which is essentially the acceleration of future costs, so relatively neutral from an economic standpoint. While there are certain benefits of accelerating the path toward normalized earnings, there are also other considerations which we would need to work through.","Incurring a loss of this magnitude at the bank could have implications for the capital plan and intercompany tax-sharing arrangements. Additionally, keep in mind that the duration profile of wholesale funding is generally longer than that of our deposits, impacting the economic benefit analysis of replacing wholesale with deposits. In short, our current position is to keep this funding source on our books; however, we are doing the work across multiple complex dimensions to determine if this should change.","The loan portfolio is a similar story. It is still our intention to hold those loans on our books, as that is precisely where we believe the value is maximized. However, as they continue to season and the risk become more visible, we are keeping a watchful eye on the secondary market. The bottom line is they are worth more today to hold on to, but if the secondary market for our portfolio were to firm up significantly, our thinking could change.","Now, turning to capital at the parent, with the introducing broker-dealer directly under the parent, we have a more definitive source of capital and some additional flexibility for how we put our capital to use. At quarter end, we had $258 million in parent cash, approximately $150 million above our target of two years' debt service coverage of $100 million. Over the near-term at least, our flexibility here is limited by other considerations, including covenants within our corporate debt, which will be a factor as long as our credit rating is sub-investment grade. And obviously, our board and regulators are constituencies that are involved in these matters.","What I want you to take from all of this is that we have some items to work through. And as we have throughout the course of our capital plan progress, we will update you when appropriate. But I can assure you that our objective is to deploy this capital in a way that maximizes value for our shareholders. In summary, and speaking for the entirety of our management team at E*TRADE, we are full steam ahead. We have checked a number of exceptional accomplishments off our to-do list already and we are eager to keep moving down this track.","And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question is from Rich Repetto, Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah. Good evening and, first, congrats on all the progress you've made on the capital plan. I guess, the first question is for Mr. pellucid, the CFO, and it has to do with the clearing that you mentioned, the capital use \u2013 the potential capital usage for the clear (27:08) as you move it out from underneath the bank. And I guess the question is, can you frame that at all as far as what you think the high end could be or what the range could be, because it's really difficult \u2013 I don't have a feel for what the even potential could be? And then also, the DTA, I believe you recognized $240 million of a benefit from the DTA that \u2013 could you verify that as well?","Matthew J. Audette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Sure, Rich. So, the DTA, you've got right. If you remember last quarter, and specifically down at the bank, we had about $600 million, half of which was included in capital. And looking at where we are today, the majority of it's included in capital. So, I think that number you used is correct. On the Clearing side, I don't have specific numbers for you, but I would say that the vast majority of what we are working on is making sure it has external lines of credit, appropriate for its size and activity. And at most broker-dealers, those lines of credit typically remain undrawn.","As I said, we are also looking at the capital side of things, but I would say that the vast majority of the things that we need to set up are on the liquidity side, not the capital side. So, hopefully that gives you some directional comfort without a number.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. And I guess, just one follow-up, would the improved guidance on the provision going forward \u2013 was that a result of \u2013 you probably said it, but I didn't get it, but the early indication from the home equity loan amortization, the results you saw so far, what \u2013 I didn't get what the driver was there.","Matthew J. Audette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I'll let Mr. distinguished take that one.","Michael A. Pizzi - Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer","It's a number of factors. As we move through, new loans move into the period of the allowance, we look at the behavior of credit of the loans \u2013 of the period. And essentially, we are coming in better than expected.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. All right. Thanks, guys.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Rich.","Operator","And our next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Hello, everyone.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Alex.","Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, lots of great detail there. Appreciate all the color there. So, just a couple of quick follow-ups, I guess, on capital. I think, there is \u2013 so, understand you guys are going to be distributing all the capital, all the net income from the bank into the holdco. Can you give us a sense of what the difference is on kind of pro forma run rate basis between capital generation versus net income at the bank, i.e. there seems like there might be some extra capital buildup still at the bank even after you guys distribute it to the holdco?","Matthew J. Audette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Alex. I think in the past the majority of that difference was really driven by the DTA benefit. Now, under BASEL III, and kind of building off of Rich's observation or comment, the majority of that is now already included in capital. So, when you think about capital generation at the bank, there could still be a little bit more. But I would say it's going to be much closer to earnings than it was in the past, because the DTA is pretty much included in capital now.","Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. Just double checking that. And then as far, I guess, as just the process goes from deploying capital both out of the bank as well as out of the holdco on a go-forward basis, and I understand you guys are evaluating lots of options and the timing might differ. But the way the regulators will approach this topic with you guys, just maybe give us a sense of how onerous would it be for you to take capital actions at the holdco and now that a lot of capital sits out of the bank, would you have to talk to the same regulators or is it perhaps \u2013 might be little bit easier to do out of the holding company? And then, with respect to breaking wholesale funding at the bank, would you have to get a pretty explicit check from the regulators, I guess, to do that?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Alex, I want to be careful how we answer this, just so that we're clear about it. We have constant dialog with our regulators, whether it's Matthew covering our progress on the capital plan, whether it's Mr. Pizzi covering how we're doing on certain risks and how we're doing building risk elements out. And so, whether somebody requires a formal notification or otherwise, we are working with the regulators on our plans and the direction we're taking. So, I don't think of it as onerous as otherwise with the clarity on our bank capital ratios that we recently achieved, it just makes having some of those discussions take place just more quickly, simply because the parameters are much clearer and because we've continued to work on making sure that our regulatory standings where it should be.","So, is it any easier? I'm not sure it's any easier or not easier. I think it's just clearer the direction we're traveling and I would say that both the board and the regulators are provided with the clarity that's required and this could dialog other way around. So, there's no surprises and sort of no sudden movements.","Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Understood. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question is from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Hey, guys. Matt thanks for all the detail, as always. Just a few follow-up clarification items. The off-balance sheet deposits, I just want to make sure we have it correct. How much of that total could you guys theoretically access, assuming \u2013 I know you don't want to go over the $50 billion asset threshold, but what is really readily accessible today or in a short period of time?","Matthew J. Audette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, I think I'd highlight a couple of things there. One, keep in mind we moved $1.25 billion on balance sheet during the quarter. So, we have \u2013 in the new sweep program, I highlighted we have $15 billion, of which $4 billion is off-balance sheet today. You wouldn't bring all of that back, because there's a decent amount of it that's off-balance sheet in that for FDIC insurance purposes. So, I would think about a portion of the $4 billion from a max possible perspective, a portion as the $4 billion. And in addition to that, over the long term, which we're working on, is that $8 billion or so in money funds that ultimately we would want to have into the program, which would then give us the flexibility. So, hopefully, it gives you some color there.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","It dose. Yeah. Thank you. And then, a few on capital. Last quarter, when your guys announced the separation of Securities and Clearing, I thought we were showing that about $900 million of capital is going to Clearing. Is that still a good rough estimate about what might be there? That's one question. Then the other is how much capital is sitting at Securities today?","Matthew J. Audette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, on the Clearing side, that's a good estimation. But keep in mind, it's got its own balance sheet. So, from impact to a capital ratio standpoint, it's only going to reduce the leverage ratio at the bank by about 10 basis points. As far as E*TRADE Securities go, it generated about $50 million of excess capital and that's what we plan to move next week.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And last question just kind of a bigger picture question, I suppose. All of the work you've guys have done in risk management, you've certainly highlighted that on tonight's call. How do you guys think that positioned you when the day comes where you want to kind of exceed the $50 billion threshold at the bank? I mean we know a lot of other smaller banks getting into some trouble just because they didn't seem to have \u2013 had a robust system. And I'm just trying to get my arms around whether all the work you guys have done really puts you in a good spot there?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Chris, as you know, and I think we've been fairly pointed on this topic in the past calls, we have no intention to go over $50 billion in any timeframe that could be considered near term. I would say that the enterprise risk management capabilities we've built out puts us in a position where should we ever decide to do that that we would just be beginning from a stronger base than we would otherwise.","And as we continue to do the things under Mr. Pizzi, they just \u2013 to continue sustaining and strengthening and using the TrimTabs (35:48) to adjust based upon the environment and what our regulatory requirements are, we'll maintain a posture that says should we wish to do that, we'll have a very good idea of what we need to do. We'll have some credibility with the regulators. We'll get good counsel from the regulators. So, we feel we're in a stronger position to move in a direction we want to should that ever occur.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys. Hey, Matt. If I look at what you said in terms of what you guys have the flexibility at both, like, the bank and the parent your priorities, when you're looking at the options, are you analyzing them based on what you can do, like, at the bank and then separately at the parent, or if one of those opportunities \u2013 let's just take the wholesale funding \u2013 is the most attractive once to do the analysis and you get the approvals, can you use the amount of capital that would be necessary to do that, or is it more of a separate decision based on where the capital resides?","Matthew J. Audette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, there is a \u2013 it's almost both, Mike. So, the issue is, when you look at our plans, we've got excess capital at the bank that we could utilize, we also have capital at the parent. But using I think wholesales is a perfect example. To the extent we did that down at the bank and the reason that we're spending a lot of time analyzing this, there could be repercussions up at the parent. As an example, our intention to request the bank's prior quarter earnings as a dividend, while if we took out wholesale, that's a $450 million pre-tax loss down at the bank. And then, you also have intercompany tax-sharing arrangements that could be impacted as well. So, it's kind of, yes, we look at them separately, but certain transactions can impact the other. So, there is a lot of work to do here. We are working on it to understand it, but there is a lot of work to do.","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. And then just a follow up, based on, with the DOL put out on fiduciary standard, just wanted to get a sense, in the different businesses that E*TRADE's in, do you see any potential impacts and then obviously the proposal, it's early, and then on the flip side any areas of potential opportunities?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we're working through all the documents and statements and assessing how the evolving standards may impact our business. Given our model, we don't expect that impact to be too extreme. But we're doing more work both internally and externally to fully understand the implications. Overall, our intention is to work to do what's best for our customers each day, irrespective of any regulatory changes. So, we are going to continue to keep a watchful eye and what changes may through with the final rules and then update what we do, as appropriate.","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question is from Bulent Ozcan with RBC. Please proceed.","Bulent Ozcan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. So, there have been many positive developments on the regulatory perspective, which is great. I spent a lot of time going through my initiation, going through the various risk factors and disclosures. And I have noticed that there is an understanding \u2013 or Memorandum of Understanding at the bank. Could you give us an update on this MOU and any other restrictions? And did you under \u2013 are there any new developments as of recently?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, let me first put a little bit of context around this and congratulations on doing your homework.","Bulent Ozcan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","MOUs, they layout a number of actions which an institution such as ours agrees to undertake with their supervisors, and many of these are really meat-and-potatoes tasks; things we need to do, things we need to put in place. But importantly, these have to seasoned with the right culture and the right attitude. I'm pleased to confirm that we've satisfied the OCC's requirements and that we are no longer subject to that MOU. But I also want to emphasize that we have close and continuous supervision from our two chief banking regulators that's the OCC and the Fed. And maintaining good regulatory standing remains a priority of this management team. So, as the environment and our business evolves, so logically will regulatory expenses and we'll give those our full attention. Does that answer your question?","Bulent Ozcan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. And maybe a second question, if I may. So, now that you've optimized your sweep program, I'm just wondering \u2013 maybe it's a different angle at the previous question, but what sort of a buffer would you need to stay below the $50 billion threshold? And just given the sweep program organization also, in terms of the changes, how long does it take you now to basically transfer monies to third-party institutions and then back again to you? Just about the duration, is that a much faster process and what kind of buffer do we need?","Matthew J. Audette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, on the buffer, I mean, just using the \u2013 under the old program, where customer activity drove the amount of deposits that were on or off balance sheet, meaning it was outside of our control, we wanted a fairly decent buffer, which is why you've seen us around the $45 billion, $46 billion for quite some time. Under the new program, which is impacted by the \u2013 your second question, timing, which I'll answer, but under the renew program, to oversimplify, we really just choose our balance sheet size. And again, I will repeat it, it's oversimplifying, but it's in that ballpark. So, I think our comfort on a buffer is much closer to $50 billion, but it is absolutely a number below $50 billion. So, we'll see that where that takes us now, meeting in the \u2013 call it, the $49 billion range.","With respect to timing, the timing is relatively efficient. I mean, if you \u2013 I think in your research and your initiation coverage discussing all of the different things that we did from a deleveraging standpoint, those took a lot of work, a lot of time, a lot of individual negotiations with banks, so months and months and months to get in place. Whereas now, it's literally just planning with our third-party sweep service provider about when and how we want balances to be on and off balance sheet, so it is incredibly quick and efficient from a timing standpoint as well.","Bulent Ozcan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I understand. And then, maybe a final one, and that will be it for me. So, if you think about your systems that you have in place, and I'm not suggesting that should be over $50 billion in terms of the threshold, but could you go over the systems and your ERM and how much it could actually handle in terms of the balance sheet size? Would you need to add a lot more in terms of capital expenditures and investments into your business to build that system at this point?","Michael A. Pizzi - Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer","Yeah, we've scaled \u2013 built an ERM platform that is scalable. I mean, we knew where we were balance sheet size when we set out on this journey. That said, there are some very specific things you need to do as you become larger. Those things will have costs that need to be built out. Probably the easiest one you can point to is the resolution point. But there are lots of other things that we can go through. There are things that will then drive explicit investment, but we've built the underlying platform to be scalable. And so, knowing that growth is important, but keep in mind Matt's comments around the wholesale funding and other items; there's plenty in flexibility to accommodate that growth and remain under $50 billion.","Bulent Ozcan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Understood. Thank you much for taking my questions. Appreciate it.","Operator","And our next question is from Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning, guys. Hello. Can you hear me?","Matthew J. Audette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, we can hear you.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good. Okay. So, just a lot of noise around robo-advisors here. And I think one of your peers gave us a little bit update earlier this morning on one of the new offerings. I know you have one of your own. Just curious if you're seeing increased flows into your offering. And as you look at the \u2013 as you assess some of the new competitive offerings out there, if you think there's anything you need to add from a capability perspective to your current offerings.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Thanks for the question. It's certainly topic du jour in the industry right now. And we've offered those capabilities given our heritage, which is intending to make the playing field level for small investors to be able to compete with bigger investors and bigger traders. So, our heritage has always been to put the educational resources and the tools in the hands of our customers. So, we've had robo-advisory capabilities built into our platform for quite some time.","Now, frankly, I'm a bit disappointed that we haven't marketed this capability as well as we might and there are some additional capabilities we're working on building into our robo-advisory platform. But we're pretty satisfied that today we have the core tools we need and we'll be building out more as we have when some of the other things you've heard us winning awards on. So, thank you for the question.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. Just a couple of questions, Matt. Just on the risk-weighted assets book for the total firm, pretty steep decline in tradition to Basel III. Was that just the margin loans being risk-weighted to zero or was something else driving that?","Matthew J. Audette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, you got it, margin loans.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Pretty simple. And then, consultant headcounts fell pretty sharply in the quarter. It's a small number, but just curious if anything is going on there?","Matthew J. Audette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Nothing is going on. Some cleanup in the metric; we had some heads in there that weren't really consultants, they were just third-party providers that really shouldn't have been in that head count. So, really, cleanup in the metric; no change in costs or anything like that.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Okay. Thank you guys for taking my questions.","Matthew J. Audette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Daniel T. Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. A question on the loan portfolio and just clarifying, I think, some of the comments about the uptick in the early-stage delinquencies with regards to change in servicing \u2013 or change in servicers. So, does that mean that all else equal, the normalized number would have been lower and we can think about that progression through this year as \u2013 I'm just trying to think about how we should think about this as a starting point versus where we can go from \u2013 throughout this year?","Michael A. Pizzi - Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer","Yeah. There were a number of servicing transfers that occurred in the quarter, both in the home equity book as well as in the 1-4 family. In the home equity portfolio, because of our history with those transfers, we've increased the reserve around that in prior quarters. The actual performance came in better. That's what we've \u2013 the note that we highlighted. That's related \u2013 that is essentially flowing through. In the 1-4 book there are also transfers. The transfers there also are affecting the delinquency levels, but we expect those to fully cure.","Daniel T. Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then, just thinking about the comments for March and the actual trading activity, I think 6% down for March. Wondering kind of how \u2013 I'm sorry, for March and April, and then if you could talk about margin balances in April. And then, generally, your expense guidance is still the same. If activity levels continue to kind of decline and you're in a little bit more of a softer environment from a revenue perspective, how are you thinking about the cost guidance in that backdrop?","Matthew J. Audette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Dan, so on margin then, without giving you a number, margin has been consistent with the prior quarters. It remained strong. So, it has not moved backwards like we saw in the trading side. On expenses, and I think a good opportunity to just take in our overall P&L and where and how we make our money.","Each quarter that goes by, when you look at the distribution of our earnings, where trading commissions fall out is not an enormous driver of our bottom line, from the amount we make on deposits, from the amount we make on margin and stock loan to the growing amount of fees and service charges from our managed products and programs. So, I think the growth and the diversification of our business model is really providing many opportunities, including not having to start projects when trading is up and stop them when it's down. So, a long way of saying, I think we feel quite comfortable with the expense guidance.","Daniel T. Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our last registered question at this time is from Joel Jeffrey with KBW. Please proceed.","Joel Michael Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hey. Good evening, guys.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Joel.","Joel Michael Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","So, most of my questions have been asked. But just curious, I know you guys have been talking about the last couple of quarters being able to move the total earnings from the bank \u2013 or making request to move the last quarter's earnings from the bank into the parent company. But I'm just curious, have you already received regulatory approval to do that and is it just a function of actually making the requests? And is there any risk that the regulators would say no to this?","Matthew J. Audette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Joel. So, like every step on the capital plan, we need individual approvals. So, the plan is to request the prior quarter's earnings. But we need to get approval each and every step along the way. So, no approvals until we get them.","Joel Michael Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. So, is there any level of risk that a regulator would say no to this?","Matthew J. Audette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I think the level of risk is on us to execute our plans well. I think we need to focus on that and continue to do it. And I think the capital plan and successes under it will follow. So, I think it's on us to execute.","Joel Michael Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","And we have a question from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please proceed.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good afternoon. Most of mine were asked as well. But just coming back to the Securities yields and, I guess, the net interest spread overall, just given kind of the ongoing pressure on Securities yields still occurring this quarter, I know that Securities book management is dynamic. But have you guys made any changes to where you're targeting duration and putting new cash to work? And then, also appreciate the color on the net interest spread and what that will look like if rates hold constant into the second quarter. But if we look beyond the second quarter, how much more compression could we expect into the back half of the year if rates weren't to move from here?","Matthew J. Audette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, Devin, no changes on where we're deploying cash. And our philosophy here is really to manage a balance sheet off of the duration of the deposits coming in. So, that's for our focus. With respect to where are spread's going, I mean, there's really two data points I have for you, which is the low- to mid-250 basis points for next quarter and then ultimately migrating up to 300 basis points in a normalized environment. The steps along the way, just have to wait for another data point next quarter.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And then just with respect to the Clearings sub and when that moves, I know the margin balances will move as well. Are there any other considerations on the asset side that we should think about?","Matthew J. Audette - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, stock borrow as well. So, that's \u2013 I mean, it's not a dramatic number, less than $1 billion, but the stock lending book goes along with it.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Right. Exactly. Okay. Good. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Okay. That's it for the questions, and I'll turn it back to Mr. Idzik.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Scott.

No other recordings or copies of this call are authorized or may be relied upon.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Roessner.","Karl Roessner","Good evening and thank you for joining us. Q1 was yet another quarter defined by meaningful progress across the business and excellent financial results as we faced significantly amplified customer activity and demonstrated strong operating discipline.","Within the context of all our team has accomplished these past 18 months it should be pretty clear by now that this high-performance operating culture is our new business as usual.","Before diving into our operating metrics, let me take a moment to comment on the environment and provide an update on our core initiatives. During the first quarter, the team navigated a confluence of meaningful market gyrations to deliver for customers.","While January kicked off the year strongly on the trading front, February was unprecedented presenting a sudden and dramatic reversal in the multi-year downward trend in volatility. And while market activity moderated in March, it was the third strongest trading month in the company\u2019s history trailing only the two months that preceded it.","All together customer activity was remarkable with quarterly DARTs shattering the record we set in Q4 and producing 7 of our top 10 trading days ever including one in early February when we approached 0.5 million DARTs, but it wasn't just transactions.","Customers truly leaned into the market more than doubling typical Q1 net buying and driving margin receivables to another all-time high. I am particularly pleased to report that amid this record setting customer activity, our platforms showed their resilience and strength.","Our risk management infrastructure also proved its value as losses from high-volatility products were kept to a minimum relative to the steep declines witnessed in the markets. And most importantly our people proved their mettle as our team worked tirelessly and intelligently throughout it all to maintain and bolster our reputation as a digital first broker that traders and investors can depend on.","Turning to our core initiatives, on the marketing front, we kicked February off with a bang at the Super Bowl dropping our first big game spot in several years helping to put us back on the map as the irreverent challenger-brand consumers love while also delivering an important message about saving for retirement.","The ad was included in virtually all top Super Bowl ad countdowns, generating significant buzz and driving strong interest in E*TRADE. That interest was evident in the increased traffic to our site following its debut as well as an uptick in retirement account openings.","And while our Super Bowl spot may be the most visible of our efforts, this past quarter we were hard at work behind the scenes delivering a host of great new tools and enhancements for our customers. On the trader front, we continue to generate solid momentum from our power E*TRADE program in growing our most active population and driving incremental interactions and transactions.","Further, product innovation is alive and well at E*TRADE as we introduced a first of its kind technical pattern recognition and education tool, rolled out 24 hour trading in some of today's most widely traded ETFs, launched the futures ladder on mobile and re-launched the fan favorite spectral analysis tool on the OH web platform.","These enhancements when taken with our entire suite of offerings, attracted industry recognition, as this quarter, we were awarded a wide array of honors from Industry Expert StockBrokers.com in their annual review including number one for mobile trading for the fifth time in six years, number one for options trading for the seventh consecutive year and best web-based platform for the second year in a row.","We also earned recognition from Barron's Annual Broker Review winning a handful of best of distinctions including options trading and long-term investing.","To name a few of our enhancements on the investing side of the house, we revamped our advice continuum intuitively packaging our managed products and meaningfully streamlining the experience to select and fund an account. We launched our new managed account dashboard, creating essential hub for investors to monitor the performance of their accounts, check on allocations, made contributions and perform other common tasks without leaving the page and we significantly expanded our commission-free ETF list offering customers multiple paths to easily diversify their portfolios.","In Corporate Services our new business momentum kept pace as we on-boarded 3.6 billion in plan assets covering 15,000 plan participants, while replenishing our pipeline which remained intact at $14 billion. Despite this influx and in fact encouraged by it, we kept our eye squarely on the ball in terms of delivering more enhancements, more functionality, and more automation for both participants and administrators.","We rolled out tax planning resources including a new supplemental tax statement that eliminated several participant pain points and has been very well received. We also rolled out a new cash plan module on the equity-edge administrator platform and we are in beta with an industry-first initiative regarding 10b5-1 automation which should greatly simplify the administration of these plans.","In addition, while the numbers are still small, we've seen decent traction in our securities-based lending product. In this quarter, we also rolled out a fully paid lending program, giving customers another task to generate value from their securities holdings.","Beyond what we have already highlighted, the quarter was also marked by the perpetual process of improving the customer experience. With enhancements to our mobile chat and SMS capabilities, further refinements to the site navigation experience and other enhancements to our storefronts, both digital and brick and mortar as well as improving the onboarding experience across several of our account types.","Outside of our everyday efforts, we have also established E*TRADE labs obtain focus solely on leveraging leading-edge technology for the benefit of our customers. They are hard at work exploring ways to harness disruptive technologies like natural language processing, AI and blockchain to name a few.","So, while we will always work to close competitive gaps and improve the platforms we offer today, we are dedicated to looking beyond that horizon at what could transform our industry tomorrow.","Earlier this month, we announced the closing of our acquisition of TCA, bringing this powerful asset into the E*TRADE family well ahead of our targeted completion date, further proving the team's ability to execute.","Our new advisory services offering bolsters our ability to further diversify our business model, tapping into a meaningful opportunity for long-term growth while expanding fee-based revenue. It has been just a couple of weeks and we are well on our way to executing on the exciting initiatives we contemplated at the outset of this transaction.","Lastly, we've begun to carefully map out the integration of the Capital One accounts, which we expect to onboard during the third quarter. While welcoming roughly a million relationships is no small task, the team is working hard to ensure a smooth transition and we continue to see tremendous opportunity in introducing this population to all that E*TRADE has to offer.","As for our operating metrics, as I mentioned earlier, DARTs of 309,000 were the highest in E*TRADE\u2019s history, up over 30% from the fourth quarter\u2019s record levels. However, we have seen moderation with April to date tracking down 13% from March levels.","Our derivative DARTs also struck a record at 98,000 for the quarter, up 41% sequentially. Our derivative mix came in at 32% as the raging equity volumes continue to dilute the effect of the incredible growth in derivatives. Suffice it to say, we are quite pleased with how we are suffice to say we are quite pleased with how we are performing on the derivatives front.","Customer margin balances grew to record levels during the quarter ending the period at $10.5 billion with an improvement in yield reflecting the Fed\u2019s December hike. In the wake of the extreme drop in value of certain leveraged volatility products in early February, we incurred approximately $5 million of losses within our margin and futures books.","While we are never happy taking losses, we are pleased with how we performed through this period as our risk management tools and conservative policies surrounding the margining of leveraged products served us well.","Net new brokerage accounts in the quarter of 60,000 equates to a 6.6% annualized growth rate. The recent acceleration in account growth portends good things as a leading indicator of net new asset growth as customers will generally start modestly and commit more assets over time as they experience our service and become aware of the breadth of our offering.","Net new brokerage assets of $5.3 million during the quarter was another record and represents a 6.3% annualized growth rate. Following the record level of net new assets raised in 2017, we are more than pleased with this momentum. Further with $6.9 billion in net securities purchases during the quarter, our customers are engaging with the markets in a meaningful way giving us additional encouragement regarding investor sentiment.","Finally managed assets increased by over $100 million during the quarter to $5.6 billion reflecting $220 million in net inflows partly offset by the impact of lower market levels.","Before I handed over to Mike to walk through the financial results in more detail, I want to address a recurring topic of investor interest regarding our growth goals and the timeline we introduced in the third quarter of 2016. First in representing the views of the board and of our management team, I can confidently state that we feel good about what we've accomplished to-date.","As you know we originally set these 18 months to 24 month goals with a singular purpose of reinvigorating growth of the franchise. And while there will always be work to do, all evidence suggests we are accomplishing exactly that.","Second, just as we were very public in setting these goals at the outset, we will be very public in communicating their resolution. On our third quarter earnings call, we expect to share with you the board's definitive assessment of our overall progress and our path to the next phase of long run value creation.","Third, while our public goals offer a window into the growth of the business, the core of our strategic initiatives continues to be enhancing the overall operating and financial performance of the company and driving meaningful value for shareholders.","As such, our assessment will incorporate but look beyond the quantitative tracking of these metrics to evaluate all avenues for long-term shareholder value creation. We look forward to discussing these in greater detail in October.","So in summation, this has been an exciting year and a half for E*Trade continually punctuated by accomplishments, progress, and results where 2017 raised the bar on customer engagement. The first quarter of 2018 vaulted it well above expectations. I am tremendously proud of the team and their continued drive to deliver more for our customers and for our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Mike Pizzi.","Michael Pizzi","Thanks, Karl. For the quarter, we reported net income of $247 million or $0.88 per share. Net revenues of $708 million were up $ 71 million from the prior quarter and represent a record level for the company.","This growth was driven by record customer trading volumes as well as the continued increase in average interest earning assets and the expansion in net interest margin. Net interest income increased $26 million to $445 million during the quarter as average interest earning assets grew by $2.5 billion and net interest margin expanded by five basis points to 297 basis points.","An improvement in interest rates higher average margin balance and better investment yields in the securities portfolio were among the key drivers of the sequential improvement in NIM.","Based on recent upward movement in the belly of the curve, our average reinvestment rate in the securities portfolio is now in the 280 basis points to 300 basis points range up 30 basis points from the prior quarter. For the full-year 2018, we are forecasting net interest margin to fall within the range of 300 basis points to 310 basis points assuming no moves in Fed funds and that our customer margin balances hold at current levels of around $10.2 billion.","However, if the Fed moves rates in June as the market broadly anticipates and we model some level of associated deposit repricing we could add an additional 2 basis points to 3 basis points to this range. I'll cover ongoing balance sheet growth dynamics in a moment.","Commission revenue of a $137 million increased 26% sequentially driven by a 31% increase in DARTs to $309,000 partially offset by a $0.14 decline in our average commission per trade which was $7.27 for the quarter. Similar to last quarter's trend, the elevated level of equity volume is having a dilutive impact on our commission per trade and we continue to see a migration of customers toward the active trading pricing here.","Additionally, while the number of options trades at record highs, derivative traders utilized fewer contracts to express their opinions largely attributable to the higher premiums in periods of volatility to achieve similar economic exposure, as well as the relative richness of many of the most commonly traded underlying stocks.","Going forward we expect our average commission per trade to be in the 720 to 740 range based on the factors I just mentioned as well as an increasing contribution from futures.","Fees and service charges increased $12 million to $105 million in the quarter primarily on higher order flow revenue reflecting elevated trading volumes, as well as seasonally higher FX fees attributable to our stock plan channel partly offsetting this off balance sheet cash revenues declined by $4 million as balances reduced during the quarter.","The average yield on third-party customer cash was up 12 basis points to 135 basis points reflecting movements in short-term rates with the March rate hike we expect the yield to rise to approximately 145 basis points when the full benefit is reflected in Q2.","We recorded $21 million provision benefit which included $5 million in net recoveries. Our allowance for loan losses now stands at $58 million while the runoff portfolio continues to decline ending the quarter at $2.5 billion. Non-interest expense was $395 million, up $31 million from the prior quarter. This quarter\u2019s adjusted operating margin which excludes provision benefit was 44%, an improvement of 140 basis points from the prior quarter.","Total marketing expense was $60 million reflecting the seasonally higher period. We are still on target with our initial forecast of roughly $200 million in marketing spent for 2018. Compensation expense was $152 million, up $14 million sequentially reflecting seasonally higher FICO-related expenses additional hiring in our service centers and incentive compensation tied to strong company performance.","With respect to our full year 2018 adjusted operating margin outlook. With respect to our full year 2018 adjusted operating margin outlook. We now anticipate delivering results in the 44.5% to 45% range assuming no further rate hikes. The key driver of the increase is the modestly better revenue environment including a higher expected NIM, a larger margin balance and robust trading volumes they\u2019re down from record levels in Q1.","If we see a fed hike in June and move deposit rates in line with our model betas, we would expect our adjusted operating margin to surpass 45% for the year. On the capital front just two brief highlights.","First, we repurchased 2.7 million shares at an average price of $52.12 for $140 million during the quarter, leading leaving approximately $500 million remaining in our share repurchase program. We continue to expect to complete the program at a relatively measured pace through the end of 2018.","Second, we close the acquisition of TCA on April 9, which is has the effect of lowering our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio by approximately 50 basis points. With respect to balance sheet growth, excluding money market balances, we now expect to maintain approximately $3.5 billion in our off balance sheet sweet cash program to maximize FDIC insurance coverage. We've increased this amount by $500 million to account for potentially higher volatility and deposit flows given recent market and customer activity trends.","For the remainder of 2018, the primary influencers of balance sheet size should be the following. The additional deposits we on-board related to our recent acquisitions including $1.5 billion of TCA customer catch, which is down $300 million from the closing date driven by customer net buying and $1.7 billion of customer cash from the Capital One accounts which we anticipate bringing on during the third quarter.","And of course growth in the core business as well as customer activity will always be an important factor in our balance sheet size. This quarter's record 6.9 billion in customer net buying should prove a stark reminder of just how much this can influence our size in any given period.","For your modeling purposes, note the TCA revenue impact will be split roughly evenly between fees and service charges and net interest income, and the majority of expenses will impact compensation and amortization of intangibles.","As for corporate cash, we ended the quarter at $439 million down $102 million sequentially reflecting a $125 million distribution from the broker dealer to the parent offset by share repurchases and payments attributable to year-end compensation. For Q2, we expect the distribution from the broker to be $100 million.","Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 26% reflecting the seasonable impact of share-based compensation. While we continue to expect quarterly volatility, we currently anticipate a full year 2018 tax rate of approximately 27%.","Finally, I want to point out a few changes in our disclosures. First, we've removed the account attrition rate from our key performance metrics. At one point in the time, this metric was more relevant though it has never offered a clear view into the retention of valuable accounts. Today as we focus squarely on growth and the retention of our most valuable customers, it is not a key measure.","Second, we now provide the average yield for the total investment securities portfolio instead of the component categories available for sale and held to maturity. This overall yield more appropriately corresponds to the investment rates and portfolio duration measures we have been consistently providing.","Third, we reclassified net deferred tax assets into other assets including prior periods presented. Our net DTA at March 31 ended at $218 million versus $251 million at year-end. We expect this balance to continue to decrease and convert into a net liability by the end of 2018. As noted last quarter, we expect to fully utilize our federal NOL later in 2018 and become a cash tax payer in 2019.","In closing, we're off to a great start in 2018 I look forward to continuing to deliver value for our customers and shareholders.","With that we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Bernstein. Please proceed.","Christian Bolu","Good morning, Karl. Good morning, Mike. Oh! Good afternoon sorry, Karl; good afternoon, Mike. So maybe not to front run, what will be an exciting Q3 call, but I just wanted to get your maybe your view on how you think or your progress on growth initiatives.","I guess very strong core growth metrics in the quarter, you're pretty much within striking distance of all the targets that the Board set out. I do appreciate it was a very strong operating backdrop, but it does feel like the management team has kind of done more, basically done more than enough to show that you can grow the business.","So I guess the question is really what else should we be thinking of or should we just go ahead and delete our merging models here and I assume the company will be a standalone for the foreseeable future?","Karl Roessner","Well, that's a pleasant thought Chris and I wouldn\u2019t do that quite yet. What I would say is I am extremely pleased with how the whole organization has responded, right. We started this journey quite a long time ago in building out a risk management framework and taking ours to the second and third lines of defense audit, our compliance guys, our risk guys, making sure we have the organization that was ready to walk before we started to run, right.","Then we built out the overall, sort of business model bringing back some real true leaders on the brokerage side who really knew how to drive at things.","And the most, the most recent things that we\u2019ve done is really all around technology and shoring up that organization bringing in some of the best and brightest talented individuals that I\u2019ve seen in the company for quite some time.","So what I would say, in terms of looking forward is you should expect to see more of the same from us in terms of execution of bringing new products online and new services online of shoring up our active traded platform, making sure that it has the best and brightest tools for our customers to use right as they interact with their finances.","So first and foremost, we want to be the leading broker for traders and investors, go forward, bar none. So that is our -- our overall goal and we will do that through efficiently executing on the strategy that we've put forward.","In terms of the growth goals and the way that we look at those, our Board as we\u2019ve talk about numerous times is very engaged. They are a very intelligent board and they want to see results. They put our feet to -- our feet to the fire when we developed the growth pull that was exactly what we did.","We wanted to accelerate where we are. I think we show that quite regularly as a management team. Certainly we\u2019ve had some tailwinds at our backs, but you still have to be able to execute to get through that.","They will go through and I will participate in the process of having the outside third party come in and take a look at value and see where we are and there will be a very deliberate process about this, right. Well, I'd like to check the box now and I think the team has absolutely performed. You guys are going to have to wait till October to sort of hear the full recital of that.","Christian Bolu","Okay. Can\u2019t wait.","Karl Roessner","Me either.","Christian Bolu","On the question on cryptocurrency, just love to get your broader thoughts on E*TRADE being a bigger player in the space. Even though interest would have died down a bit in the last few months, it does seem like it is the best customer acquisition tool for millennials and just given none of the, none of the online broker incumbents are major players, I would've thought given your focus on growth, your heritage as a digital minded innovator, it seems like it would be right up E*TRADE\u2019s ally. So just curious kind of your thoughts on E*TRADE being a bigger player in the space?","Karl Roessner","Yeah. So, it's a great question and what I would say is when you look at what we have done and it sort of dovetails with the answer I just gave to the prior question. Technology first, all right being digital as part of who we are making sure that we are using our new labs that we just stood up with some very talented individuals to really look at new technologies and having our you know retail brokerage guys, the folks who know the markets and the segmentation. Extremely well, taking a look at where we can adapt that technology, where we can get ahead, all right.","We don't want to just getting into it. We'd like to leap frog and move forward. So, that\u2019s, that's who we are that you know as -- sort of the smallest on the street, we're able to be a little bit more nimble.","So we are looking at you know a blockchain at voice, all right. How can we use that to better serve our customers? So I would say, you're on the right track in terms of things that we're focusing on just you know more to come as we really get labs and integrate go forward.","Christian Bolu","Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a very strong quarter.","Karl Roessner","Thank you very much Christian.","Operator","The next question is comes from the line of Rich Repetto with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please proceed.","Rich Repetto","Yeah. Good evening, Karl. Good evening, Mike. I guess \u2013 good evening. The first question is on the deposit betas and when you know you put out increase rates towards with the March rate hike. So Mike I was just trying to see you know what the deposit beta I don\u2019t think you're going to break out the tiers.","But what the deposit beta is and then what you anticipate if there was another rate hike in June, would you see some dip you know deposit beta, how are you looking, but that?","Karl Roessner","Yeah. I mean look the betas will differ by each tier and how we're looking at it. There is obviously different competitive pressure at different points relative to the cash balance. If you're looking for a deposit rate including customer payables for Q2, we would put that sort of in the seven basis point to eight basis point range with no hikes.","We just stay where we are today. If the Fed does hike in June, we're going to evaluate the competitive environment. We think we're at a point now where it makes sense to continue to move. Rates have moved considerably away from where they were over a year ago and where we will continue to evaluate sort of the competitive environment and move accordingly.","Rich Repetto","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And then I guess one other thing, Karl. So the headcount, if you look quarter-to-quarter from yearend up 4.5%, almost 5% I guess if you look at \u2013 if you include the consultants.","So I guess trying to understand the headcount and how that plays into. Could that does help you reach your goals. And trying to understand like you did mention also that there\u2019d be an assessment going on.","I'm trying to make that get it a little bit more clear, but there is an assessment that will be done by a third party. And we\u2019d expect to see that in the third quarter on the third quarter call.","Karl Roessner","So let me take the last part of that question first, Rich. And then I'll ask Mr. Pizzi to play in a little bit on comp and headcount. So, what I\u2019d say- and headcount. So, what I'd say there is something we've been through before and that is the board is truly one of the sort of fully informed boards and they've been doing this for a very long period of time in having one of the big banks on the street come in and really look at intrinsic value, right and take a look at how the company is setup, what our growth model is, how it plays out and what the real value is of the growth plans that management has put in place.","So, they have third-party independent verification. They will use that information this year in connection with the results of the growth goals, the value that we've created for shareholders over the past 18 months and then at that point 24 months where we are in the cycle and they'll look at that in its entirety as they form the answer and the results that will present on the third quarter call. So, I wouldn't say third-party is the same independent sort of valuation that the board goes through on a pretty regular basis. Mike, do you want to take the comp question?","Michael Pizzi","Sure. The build out in headcount to 160 or so heads you see there is largely a build out on our service channels to support increased volumes and customer interactions that have really been building during this sort of market environment and during this period of elevated growth.","The consultants are so that you see there that the 30 or so increase that is really support to continue to process online account openings, tax, other items to keep a streamlined and high level of service offering processes to our customers, that's really the driver of the key headcount.","Overall, compensation in the period, it\u2019s some of that is the typical Q1 cycle resets and payroll taxes that go through. The payroll taxes are a little elevated this period given the performance in the stock that generates higher overall amount of payroll tax that goes through, that's driving a bit of the compensation as well.","Benefits costs are up and the company did elect to increase the match on its 401(k) to bring it in line with the peer set in the marketplace. So that is you know that also added a little bit to the overall comp expense in the period. And then lastly, the performance itself increasing the amount we accrue for compensation.","Rich Repetto","Okay. Thanks guys. Thanks for the help.","Karl Roessner","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Please proceed.","Steven Chubak","Hey, good afternoon. So question on the long-term NIM outlook, clearly a strong IRR result this quarter, deposit beta as you noted, Mike continues to surprise positively. I\u2019m just wondering longer term, as we look out Fed Futures curve is now pricing in about an additional four rate hikes through 2019.","How should we think about the steady state in NIM target and against that backdrop, if we get four hikes what are you guys assuming, in terms of a model deposit beta supporting that target?","Michael Pizzi","Yeah. I mean looking at the four hikes from looking at how we will you know will \u2013 NIM will adjust a lot will depend on really what happens on the shape of the curve with those hikes. We are flattening a great deal, but we\u2019re seeing rates in the belly, where we invest move up considerably and that's really what's \u2013 what's affecting that overall reinvestment yield moving into that 280 to 300 basis point range.","Some would say that, if you're going to get four hikes, you\u2019ve got to see more movement across the yield curve, if not you\u2019re going to get to a point really where the where the yield curve starts to \u2013 starts to invert. So you know if we see that and you continue to see that the reinvestment rates move higher that will ultimately show up in our net interest margin driving us to higher margins from the guidance here.","We also are benefiting from the movements in LIBOR to the extent LIBOR is wide and above funds, which has also been going on in the market, so that is driving some additional benefit and coming through into the net interest margin guidance that we're giving.","But strictly to adjust our rate hike, the June rate hike is about two basis points to three basis points in terms of value for half a year, you can really approximately double that on a full year interval if we were to sort of annualize out the hikes. So I think you can kind of see what that's modeled at in terms of total net interest margin relative to the estimated beta which is included in that estimate.","Steven Chubak","That\u2019s perfect, Mike. Thanks for all that color. And just one follow-up relating to Richard\u2019s earlier question and your comments around the comp ratio, but thinking about it bigger picture, certainly you guys have outlined growth targets. You've made significant progress and it's certainly evident this quarter on the revenue side.","I'd say the one area that's been a bit disappointing and I recognized there\u2019s some seasonality dynamics related to expense, sort of lack of operating leverage. I'm wondering as you evaluate the progress as we get closer to 3Q, how should we think about your ability to deliver more significant operating leverage where clearly you're having progress on those growth targets that you've outlined.","But a lot of that seems to be driven by accelerating investment, and investment levels that appear to be in excess of peers.","Michael Pizzi","We had a 140 basis point improvement in operating margin. So you can see how incremental revenue volumes moved through to the bottom line. It was disappointing I think we had a \u2013 we view it as a pretty strong result in terms of the degree to which the revenue build is translating.","We are upping sort of our long-term guidance given the revenue environment quite considerably in terms of the operating margin guidance going forward. We think ultimately now with a 100 basis points parallel","We think ultimately now with a 100 basis point parallel shift and really with the achievement of our growth goals, operating margins as high as 49% are realizable.","All of that said, we are looking at sort of ways to improve, always retool and improve our efficiency and find productivity to fund the investment overall. You don't see that this quarter, we had to respond with headcount and some other cost builds to absorb some of the volume and call pressure but we're always looking for ways to be more efficient overall.","Steven Chubak","Got it, so that 49% target that you outlined, it feels like that's a reasonable path that you see and it's just some ephemeral or seasonal dynamics that maybe dampen some of the progress this quarter.","Michael Pizzi","So, as we continue to build out our growth initiatives and we onboard the cash and other items from the acquisitions, the growth that we're experiencing plus the acquisitions that work through especially when sort of fully energized and you have the full impact of the higher rate environment overall from a revenue base, we see especially with continuations in the increases in interest rates as the prior question pointed out, four hikes embedded into the curve, 49% is realizable.","Steven Chubak","That's great and very encouraging to hear. Thanks a lot Mike for taking my questions.","Operator","The next question comes from line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Chris Harris","Thank you. You guys are at 6% to 7% organic growth today. Wondering if you think there's a lot of upside to those numbers or is the focus really on trying to preserve that level of growth? And then if you do think, there's upside. What do you think the drivers could be?","Karl Roessner","Well, look I like to think that we can always do better and that then we can continue to improve and in a lot of the upside or the generation is keeping the base of customers that you have and your active trader base in particular and the higher end of the book.","Extremely pleased with both of the, you know, the technological offering and their interface every day that they use to interact with their finances and also providing top tier customer service on the back-end to make sure they know that they have a human being who is there to listen to them and to help them when they have an issue or when they want some thoughts around what it is they're doing, and then you know also improving the value chain for them.","So I look at it as you know you need to maintain, protect and defend the base as you bring them in to make sure that those folks who are with you, investors and traders, are happy at all times, right. And they like using E*TRADE and they're comfortable with it and I love the brand, and it continues to punch above its weight.","In terms of growing that go-forward, I look at what we've done even with the TCA acquisition and the ability to keep that customer relationship on us when they would normally be moving to an investment adviser or going off to start to use that chain through referral networks and otherwise to have them stay as a longer term sort of E*TRADE family customer if you will, and also taking that same platform and trying to crack the code of the stock plan participant population and turn some of those folks into longer term E*TRADE customers right, given more fulsome relationship with those individuals.","And that comes from you know both the technology we put out there on the stock plans side, the offerings that we have for them, you know moving forward making the stock plan experience that much better. And these are all things that are working in progress and sort of real time as, you know, as we speak to launching them out there.","So I do think there is additional upside. This is not a management team that's sort of happy or satisfied to say There\u2019s additional upside, this is not a management team that\u2019s sort of happy or satisfied to say, hey we\u2019re done. The growth goals were just the beginning it\u2019s definitely not an end state.","Chris Harris","Got it. Thank you.","Karl Roessner","Yeah.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Conor Fitzgerald with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Karl Roessner","Hey, Conor.","Conor Fitzgerald","Hey, good afternoon. Like you mentioned you had a record quarter for net buying in 1Q. I think your recent streetwise survey show that there had been a significant downshift in investor sentiment at the beginning of April.","So just wondering if you see any signs of your customer base changing its behavior or if you see any signs of the recent market volatility could spur some growth in your deposit base.","Karl Roessner","So look we've definitely and we've said in the prepared remarks, we've seen a decrease, I think April was down about 13% on volumes over where we were in March. So we have seen some of the slowdown in that, some of the activity that you\u2019d seen around the cryptos or the marijuana stocks and some of the other pieces that were there.","So you've definitely seen some slowdown going on but our customer base, in terms of the net buying, the volatility that's there that's when are \u2013 the top of our book and our customers who use margin and who do a lot of trading activity with us that's when they are most active. I think, you've seen those folks really as we said in the prepared lean into this market and become very active.","So if history repeats itself when sort of markets go down or volatility starts to come out of the marketplace, you would see a rise in some of the cash balances and in this environment, we'd be extremely pleased with that. I don\u2019t know, Mike if you have anything to add on top.","Michael Pizzi","I think we gave that percentage to DARTs have moderated a bit thus far in April. Margin down to 10.2% from 10.5% I think that's your best indicator of customer risk appetite. So a small moderation their overall, customers are still fairly engaged in the market. The volatility is generally still beneficial although some of the categories that Karl noted have come down quite a bit from where they were earlier in the quarter.","Conor Fitzgerald","It's very helpful color. Thanks and then maybe just from a big picture perspective with Fed funds now at 175 basis points, the risk reward equation for further rate hikes versus the risk that the Fed cuts rates for some unforeseen reason has got a lot more balanced. Just given that have you given any thought that changing your \u2013 the interest rate profile of the firm?","Michael Pizzi","It's difficult to do still in terms of -- in terms of just where we've come from an interest rate, but it\u2019s a very good question as you move further away from sort of the zero rate floor and you fully restore the value of the deposit. The ability to hedge some of the further downside does become possible. It's something that that is always a matter of discussion at ALCO's but at this point in time it's not something we're doing.","Conor Fitzgerald","Thanks for taking my questions.","Karl Roessner","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please proceed.","Brennan Hawken","Hey, good afternoon, thanks for taking the question guys.","Karl Roessner","Hi Brennan.","Brennan Hawken","So you guys have highlighted a couple of times about activity levels pulling back and just curious whether or not you think that that might have an impact on the margin loan balances that and where it stood at quarter end?","Karl Roessner","I mean look we've definitely seen some slight deterioration from quarter end, this quarter to today just Mike just went through we're down from 10.5% to around 10.2% but our customers at that end of the book are still extremely engaged in this market and are still as far as we can tell taking the opportunities that some of the market dips in the volatility are presenting.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Thanks very much.","Karl Roessner","Sure.","Operator","The next question comes from line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Brian Bedell","Good evening, folks.","Karl Roessner","Hi, Brian.","Brian Bedell","Mitch, if you could go back to the deposit beta question and the NIM guidance. Just can you repeat that? I think you were saying on the payables, I think you were seeing 8 basis points which is not a whole lot or are you really talking about the entire retail deposits\u2026","Karl Roessner","Yeah. We just look at the sweep deposits, so total deposits plus customer payables, put the two categories together. So our total on balance sheet customer related funding, if you want a number for Q2 \u2013 or it's going to be in that seven basis point to eight basis point range, knowing that there are deposits that shift up and down and tier, so it doesn't -- it's not completely precise but it's going to land somewhere in that range overall on the total deposit profile, that's without any further action and deposit rates.","If the Fed does raise I June, we\u2019ll most likely to move in line in terms of expectation that follows our NIM guidance, it should be about two basis points to three basis points of additional net interest margin.","Brian Bedell","Got it. Okay. And then is those two margin lending is also moving up almost in lockstep, are you testing through most of that?","Karl Roessner","Yeah. Margin lending moves up in lockstep. You see some competitive give back in that book for some of the larger customers who are who will request you know some accommodation around the hikes, but we are largely moving the book 100% with movements in the funds rate.","Brian Bedell","Okay. Great. And then just get back to the third quarter board assessment. Karl with some I guess in that process and their due diligence process of evaluating your progress in E*TRADE independent internal progress.","Are they also looking at what the firm value would be from a potential acquirer perspective and essentially looking out in the market at firms that would be interested in E*TRADE and seeking those type evaluations and also considering the macroenvironment where we are in the bull market cycle in economic expansion where we might be going over the next few years?","Karl Roessner","So I -- it's a good question and what I would say is that the evaluation that they will go through will be an intrinsic value calculation, part of that will include the third-party banks assessment of who is out in the marketplace, a capacity to pay sort of the interest levels, the market environment in general where we are, I mean just keep in mind this is a very active board who is very well informed. So pretty much anything that you can think about them evaluating before they come to their decision, they will have taken that into account before we could tell in the October call.","Brian Bedell","Okay. And that would include the macro environment?","Karl Roessner","Absolutely.","Brian Bedell","Yeah. Okay. Great. Thank you.","Karl Roessner","Sure.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please proceed.","Devin Ryan","Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.","Karl Roessner","Hey, Devin.","Devin Ryan","Maybe just one follow-up here on the margins, so the $5 million mark this quarter from the Inverse mix products, I mean that seems like a pretty aberrational situation, but does that make you change the risk parameters at all in terms of how you think about the book?","And then, just bigger picture as the mix moves more towards derivatives with the firm, does that make margin balances stickier at all than in the past. I guess I'm just trying to think about the variability and stress testing it in a volatile environment if it goes back to you know kind of similar trends here?","Karl Roessner","So on the risk parameters and what we went through on the wall products primarily in sort of the aftermarket when those things just moved. We haven't changed modified, but we constantly look at those.","It's one of the things that I highlight as you know our risk management process and the interaction and the collaboration between our risk team and the business is one-to-one. I mean they work very, very well together. They got through this situation together and I think they did an amazing job at coming through.","So while this makes you more vigilant, it doesn't necessarily change what we've done, because I think what we had in place and what we've been doing all along has been quite good and it performed it\u2019s we're able to be there.","In terms of derivatives and driving margin balance, look that the folks who we are power E*TRADE and the platform that we've gone out with, with the 30 trades per quarter and the lower pricing and sort of the service team that's available on the derivative side.","We've definitely seen more engagement, we've seen more volumes coming out of that. You've seen our derivatives as an absolute number grow to a number that quite honestly I'm still impressed and sort of astounded by what we hit over the past three months in terms of derivative trades that will drive additional margin, we've seen the interaction with it, whether or not it's more sticky than it has been in the past.","I couldn't give you that in terms of guidance or help you on that one. I can just say that, we have a customer base right now that has leaned into the marketplace is very engaged in the margin book even given the recent sort of activity in the marketplace and the slowdown in volumes of absolute trades just from the end of March that hasn't receded as much as I would have thought given what's going on. So that\u2019s about it, it\u2019s helpful if as I can be on that one, sorry about that.","Devin Ryan","Fair enough. Appreciate the color. And then just with respect to the stock plan accounts, nice increase from your end and a nice increase from your end and I know that's been a focus. But maybe if you just give us a little bit more breakdown of kind of what drove the success there this quarter and then just expectation for growth maybe over the next few quarters, if you can?","Karl Roessner","Yeah. So I mean look it's been a great story, the stock plan and I'm always as you guys know, I'm always happy to sort of drone on about this one, because it's been such a win for us. A lot of what we talked about when we started this journey is coming to fruition, a lot of the stock plans that were on some of the larger players, who are moving to a technology solution or a third-party solution.","Those customers have come into play, right, those stock plan customer customers and we are as we had hoped and as quite frankly I expected, we are winning our fair share of those. So even this past quarter, I think we on boarded $3.6 billion, 15,000 new customers and we were at $14 billion at the end of the quarter, we refilled that.","So we're back at another $14 billion during that period. So you know we've definitely been winning our fair share of engagements and I fully expect that will continue particularly as you know we take some of the technology solutions that we're working on and roll more into the equity edge online, right it's number one now, we don't plan on just sitting on our laurels on the equity edge online platform.","We're moving it forward and looking for the next-gen so that we continue to win these accounts and that you keep your customers happy. But so I do expect continued growth there and I\u2019m very pleased with the \u2013 what the teams has done and you know what they been able to do onward these folks.","Devin Ryan","Thanks Karl.","Karl Roessner","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Please proceed.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. Can you update us on some of the metrics for TCA, you know the number of advisors, it looks like it\u2019s gone up and the revenue numbers were I think referring are from June 30, of last year?","Karl Roessner","Yeah. Just to give you up the -- in net interest income that we're going to pick up from TCA is now fully factored into our guidance. So, I won't give any detail on that, because it's just it's in the total and we gave the expectation in terms the amount of cash we onboarded.","We expect fees and service charges to improve by about $10 million on their custody fees, per quarter per quarter. And then on the expense side, we're going to pick up about $6 million in comp, about $2 million in intangible amortization per quarter and then about another $4 million across other random categories on the expense side.","Dan Fannon","Great. And then can you just talk about their historical growth profile organically, how we can think about net new assets based on maybe the last 12 months?","Karl Roessner","So when I look at TCA I sort of look go forward with them. When I look at putting the power of the brand behind them and helping them become TCA by E*TRADE and then longer term, establishing them as a you know a brand within you know E*TRADE as it sits on their so the E*TRADE savings bank. So, we lead our advisors solutions go forward.","In terms of on boarding and historical growth rates, I can tell you that if early days are any indication you know our brand and the power that we've been able to put behind this fantastic property is going to be a nice thing go forward.","I don't know the historical growth rates are really going to give you an indication of go forward just pay some of the interest that we've had as we come into this marketplace. So more to come on TCA, we've had it under the hood you know a couple of weeks now.","And I think next quarter we'll have a better handle on, you know initial indication of where we are, where we\u2019re headed and what the pipeline looks like for the rest of the 2018.","Dan Fannon","Thank you.","Karl Roessner","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, this is Zach filling in for Mike. Just a question on the account growth, can you give an idea of the makeup of these new accounts. Are they new clients to investing or are they may be taking share from other, other competitors?","Karl Roessner","So, look when I look at it, it's pretty much across the board. We've had engagement from new customers coming in new entrants into the marketplace with smaller accounts who are looking to place a trade or engage with E*TRADE for the first time.","And then we've also had our own customers bringing more, more to us or opening other accounts. So it's really been across the board, I don't think there's a specific designation of where they're coming from. We definitely have a hotly competitive environment for that, as we define it active trader accounts and those folks in the upper end of the population.","And a lot of the individuals who come on who are the new traders are really just coming in to take a look at what you offer, what's online, what you're at \u2013 what your experience is like and they're shopping around. So there are a lot of them are in and out, but it's pretty healthy right now across all, all avenues.","Unidentified Analyst","And if we stay on the account theme, if we look ahead to the capital one accounts that would be on board in 3Q. What kind of opportunity do you see on the potential revenue synergies with that, that's about 25% or 30% of your current account base being added, it seems they would be potentially significant?","Michael Pizzi","Yeah, keep in mind it's a much lower active population, that the DART number is in the teens thousands to 16,000 to 17,000 range. Well, it's a lot of the accounts, the average assets per account is even \u2013 is smaller than ours. But I think what we see there is a really significant amount of potential.","A large number of -- million customers who have engaged in digitally distributed financial services have managed their money online have made an investment over time and saved and invest through that platform, we're going to give them a greatly expanded platform, greatly expanded service and features that they're not getting today. And we believe over time that we will be able to get significant amount of revenue synergy from that acquisition.","Karl Roessner","Yeah. To be able to market to that population who is now \u2013 will now be on us when we translate them into E*TRADE customers, right, and when they're on-boarded onto our platforms. That's the real opportunity for us.","And as Mike said, these are folks who have engaged with their finances, they have been to a certain extent self-directed and it's \u2013 for us it's a perfect audience for us to turn on our marketing machine and see what we can do to help them with our finances.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. Appreciate the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mewhirter with SunTrust. Please Proceed.","Doug Mewhirter","Yeah. My primary question was answered, just one quick follow-up on the Capital One portfolio. Do you anticipate any incremental expenses beyond any kind of one-time integration, or you sort of budgeting extra staff or extra IT budget, on-going IT budget or staff post that integration. I realized just a bunch of accounts but I didn't know if you were \u2013 had built anything in your model.","Karl Roessner","The easiest way to answer this is that, it is all within the operating guidance that we provided. The operating leverage that Mike set out, it's all in there.","Doug Mewhirter","Okay. Thanks.","Karl Roessner","Yeah.","Doug Mewhirter","And that's all my questions.","Karl Roessner","Appreciate it.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Vincent Hung with Autonomous Research. Please proceed.","Vincent Hung","Hi. Just on the growth goals again, so you touched upon it before but seeing as industry growth rate is quite strong right now, how exactly will you pass through what is the results of the industry tailwinds and what\u2019s the result of the successful execution by the management team?","Karl Roessner","So when we look at what we set out for, you know, for growth goals and what we laid out in terms of the numbers that you know we needed to generate, needed to show the board and our shareholder base that we could actually have a serious growth initiative and that we could push E*TRADE forward, because we had stagnated a bit both in terms of brand and in terms of the offering that we had out there.","I look at what we've done and I think the entire industry has been aided you know somewhat by you know tailwinds that are out there now and I'm quite pleased with the results that we've been able to generate, you know, given those tailwinds.","You still have to have an offering that resonates with individuals, you need to be able to drive account growth, you need to be able to go out and garner new assets, and you need to have the technological advancements that keep you current.","So I look at what we've done as hugely successful and I think we always say that you know we're very happy for the tailwinds that we've had, but I'd put the successes that we've had up against pretty much anyone.","Vincent Hung","Right. Great. Thanks.","Karl Roessner","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Chris Allen with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed.","Chris Allen","Hey guys. Just a couple of quick ones. Obviously derivatives as a percentage of DARTs picking back up again. I wonder if you give us any granularity in terms of the percentage of your customer base that are active users and maybe frame kind of the opportunity from that perspective moving forward?","Michael Pizzi","We don't really disclose that. You know, we continue to show derivative, you know, derivative opportunities or work with what we're doing in the education area to show customers how they can use derivatives from a protection of principle perspective, from a they can use derivatives from a protection of principal perspective, from a you know covered calls for return enhancement.","I mean roughly the amount of derivative users today is around 20% or so of the overall customer base, but we're optimistic through our efforts that we'll be able to drive that higher over time.","Chris Allen","Thanks, guys. And just one other quick one, just obviously the headcount went up a decent amount you discussed that at length. It sounds like you just \u2013 you\u2019re preparing yourself for the higher activity, you saw this quarter and probably the deals that you\u2019re going to be closing on the near term. What are the hiring plans moving forward, you\u2019re in a good spot for now in terms of kind of the outlook from a business perspective moving forward this year?","Karl Roessner","And I think look Mike hit it pretty well in the beginning of the call. We brought on some heads. We had to take some additional headcount and some additional customer service people both to get us through increased volumes as well as you know tax season, which is always a big, big task for our service guys.","Just helping customers with all the tax information that comes through in the way it\u2019s all presented. Going forward, I think we\u2019re in a pretty good place. And as Mike said, we\u2019re back to looking at you know how can we drive additional efficiencies in the organization.","How can we make sure we continue to run as lean and mean as we have and we will continue to fund new investment through finding in the organization, you know, those pockets where we can move dollars or transfer dollars around. So very comfortable with the out margin guidance that we\u2019ve given and I wouldn\u2019t expect any additional heavy builds.","Chris Allen","Got. Thanks guys.","Karl Roessner","Yeah.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please proceed.","Kyle Voigt","Hi. Good evening. Maybe just one from me, really just on the managed product growth, I think you cited net inflows again in the quarter and you\u2019re very quickly approaching that $6 billion goal, I am just wondering if you could help us understand what\u2019s been working there, maybe some examples of things you've changed or done differently over the past 12 months to 18 months to really help accelerate the growth in that business? Thank you.","Karl Roessner","Thanks. So the investment area we've always have \u2013 kits that we always have, we launched some of this back in about 2009 in terms of putting those products out there and trying to grow the investing side of the business. But it wasn't laid out in a way that was very user friendly. It wasn't set forth in a way that a lot of our customers knew what we had on the site.","So, reinvigorating that through the investing advice continuum that we now have out that on the website, it's very easy to find the products. It starts with a basic core portfolio which is our robo offering and then there is a little more blended portfolio that has a little bit of assistance and then you can go right into the sort of full FC back to working with NFC to design your own independent portfolio.","So laying it out in a way that's helpful, the products that we have are pretty good at matching or beating their performance indices. So, we've had the product, we've had the people to help us do that but we haven't done a lot to put our muscle behind it and show E*TRADE as a place for investors as well as trading and not some of the initial success we've had is just realigning that business organization, getting the right people driving it forward and making sure that it fits within the digital ethos that is us, that is E*TRADE and then it's very easy for people to find, easy for them to interact with and really driving them toward the value proposition that we have on that side of the house.","So for me, it's more about alignment and awareness and we're finally there. So don't take the $6 billion as \u2013 again as an end game. That was a proof point for us to say how quickly can we grow it, lots more to come on the investing side of the house.","Kyle Voigt","Thank you.","Operator","And Mr. Roessner, there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to you.","Karl Roessner","Great. Thank you all for tuning in and we look forward to talking to you in three months. Have a nice evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

No other recordings or copies of this call are authorized or may be relied upon. ","With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve Freiberg.","Steven J. Freiberg","Operator, thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining today's call. I will begin by covering highlights from the year, adress a few items from the quarter, and then Matt will take you through the results. I will follow with additional comments, after which, we'll open up the call for questions.","Let me begin by saying I am pleased to report that 2011 was the company's first profitable year since 2006. It wasn't an easy year by any measure, but we maintained a focus on the business and on our customers, and are proud of the way our team executed. We faced challenging headwinds during 2011, including a near-0 interest rate environment, which pressured our spread and net interest income. Global macroeconomic uncertainty, leaving many retail investors less engaged than they otherwise would have been. And continued stress in real estate. However, we proactively worked to mitigate these environmental pressures as we grew broker-related cash by 13% during the year, offsetting the majority of spread compression at the 12 basis points contraction in spread only led to a $6 million decline in net interest income.","Despite the macroeconomic challenges, we grew DARTs by 5% during the year as we continue to increase accounts and assets. And we continue to aggressively focus our loss-mitigation strategies, including short sales, loan modifications and transfers to higher touch servicers.","Separately, the company transitioned regulators during the second half of the year from the OTS to the OCC and the Fed. Throughout 2011, we focused our efforts on strengthening our core business and in addition, have made significant strides in de-risking the company.","I will now highlight several key accomplishments that have enhanced our strategic position. First and foremost, we remained focused on strengthening the financial position of the company. We moved forward on many fronts as we progressed from significant losses in 2007 to profitability in 2011. In addition, we increased our capital levels and ratios. And with the exception of a slight dip in Q4, our capital levels, at both the bank and the parent, are the strongest in the firm's history. Finally, we continued to improve our risk profile as the legacy loan portfolio declined another $3 billion during the year, while delinquencies improved double digits. The portfolio ended the year at $13.2 billion, down 60% from its peak.","With regards to our core brokerage franchise, we made solid progress on improving our competitive position. During 2011, we nearly doubled the amount of net new brokerage accounts over last year's levels and broadened net new assets of $9.7 billion, up from $8.1 billion in the prior year. Additionally, our attrition rate decreased nearly 200 basis points through a firm record 10%. We continue to grow our institutional businesses. Our Corporate Services group brought on 46 new clients in 2011 and starts the year off well with a pipeline of 33 clients. Our market making business grew revenue in a tough environment and increased its external NMS order flow. Finally, we remained committed to enhancing our market position in the long-term investor segment. While this is a relatively new focus for us, we continue to grow balances and accounts, and we are building a solid foundation for this business. Our sales force initiative is a very important element of this strategy. ","In 2011, we grew our team of financial consultants by 42% and remained committed to this effort. We also announced the number of enhancements in new products during the year. We launched E*TRADE Pro Elite for our most valuable active traders, Portfolio Margin, expanded CNBC contact, algorithmic charts, a number of options tools, and we introduced the E*TRADE Community. We launched a number of enhancements for E*TRADE mobile, including mobile check deposit capability for the iPhone, we expect to launch on the Android very early this year. Finally, we continue to expand our investor education offerings across a number of channels, including online videos, live and on-demand web seminars and live events. Total interactions with our education platform increased 63% from last year, to over 1 million.","Finally, as it relates to fourth quarter results, several unique items impacted business performance. And in a moment, Matt will take you through the details.","It is noteworthy to emphasize that for the quarter and year, our franchise metrics were relatively solid as we continue to grow the key business drivers. ","I will now turn the call over to Matt.","Matthew J. Audette","Thank you, Steve. For the fourth quarter, we reported a net loss of $6 million or $0.02 per share on a revenue of $475 million. ","These results included a few items unique to the quarter: First, we recorded a $46 million recovery to charge-offs, resulting from a settlement with a third-party mortgage originator; second, we increased the qualitative portion of our allowance and made an adjustment to our valuation methodology for certain homes in the process of foreclosure; Third, we recorded a $10.8 million expense related to the settlement of class-action lawsuits; fourth, a $7 million reduction to the ARS reserve established in the third quarter; and finally, we expensed $8.7 million related to internally developed software costs, which were previously capitalized.","For the full year, we recorded net income of $157 million or $0.54 per share compared with a net loss of $28 million or $0.13 per share in 2010. In addition to the unique items from the fourth quarter, our full year results included a $48 million reserve for settlements and repurchases related to auction rate securities and a $62 million tax benefit related to the taxable liquidation of a European subsidiary.","In the fourth quarter, we generated $475 million of net revenue, down from $507 million in the third quarter and $518 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Our fourth quarter revenue included net interest income of $289 million, a sequential decline of $16 million as our net interest spread declined to 266 basis points from 281 in the prior quarter, reflecting lower loan yields, a decrease in margin balances and the current rate environment.","We continue to expect spread to compress during 2012. And given the continued challenges of the interest rate environment, we expect that our spread could average slightly less than 250 basis points for the full year 2012. Again, I would highlight that this assumes no change to our current balance sheet strategy.","Commissions, fees and service charges, principal transactions and other revenue in the fourth quarter were $156 million, down 14% from both the third quarter and the same quarter of 2010. This decrease is driven by lower DART volumes versus both periods and a decline in the average commission relative to the fourth quarter of 2010. Revenue in this quarter also included $30 million of net gains in loans and securities, including a net impairment of $3 million.","Expenses fell by $37 million in the prior quarter, largely as a result of the auction rate securities reserve and the true-up to FDIC charges included in the prior quarter. Included within the fourth quarter is a seasonal increase in advertising spend, as well as an $8.7 million expense related to a review and the resulting adjustment of costs associated with internally developed software. The adjustment resulted in increases to operating expenses of $7.4 million to compensation and benefits, $3 million to professional services and a $1.7 million reduction to depreciation and amortization. Finally, we reported a $10.8 million expense related to the settlement of class-action lawsuits.","Turning now to the metrics. DARTs for the fourth quarter were 140,000, a 15% decline from last quarter and down 7% from a year ago. For the full year, DARTs were 157,000, up 5% from 2010 and represented quite a volatile year in retail trade.","During 2011, we experienced an all-time record high for trading volumes as we executed nearly 360,000 trades in one day following the U.S. debt downgrade. Net new brokerage accounts were 10,000 in the fourth quarter, down from 13,000 in the prior quarter and 28,000 in the fourth quarter of 2010. For the full year, net new brokerage accounts were 99,000, nearly double the 54,000 we recorded in 2010. I would also note that brokerage account attrition was a record low of 10% for the full year, down from 12% in 2010 and 13% in 2009. While we constantly aim to improve customer retention, we are quite pleased with this improvement, and it's a testament to our investments in sales and service.","Net new brokerage assets totaled $9.7 billion for the full year, up 20% from last year and inclusive of $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with $28 billion in brokerage-related cash, an increase of $3 billion during the year. Meanwhile, customers were net buyers of $3.8 million of securities. Margin receivables ended the year at $4.8 billion and averaged $4.9 billion during the quarter, down from $5.4 billion during the prior quarter and flat with the year-ago quarter. Our legacy loan portfolio ended the year at $13.2 billion, a contraction of $664 million during the quarter and is now down 60% from its size at the peak. For the full year, the portfolio contracted $3 billion, largely reflecting $2.3 billion in paydowns.","I will cover more in the quality of the book in a moment. But first, I would like to address this quarter's provisions. During the quarter, we booked a provision for loan losses of $123 million, which included a recovery of $46 million related to a mortgage repurchase settlement, a $15 million collateral valuation write-down for certain loans in the process of foreclosure and a $67 million increased to the qualitative component of the allowance, which now stands at $124 million.","The $46 million repurchase settlement, which was disclosed in our most recent 10-Q, was the largest single settlement we have received to date and brings a total to just over $335 million during the life of the put back program.","The $15 million collateral valuation write-down relates to a change to our processes of using automated valuation models, or AVMs, to estimate the value of the property in cases where we haven't obtained the full appraisal or other property-specific information.","The increase write-downs are intended to refine the estimate for property conditions not fully captured in the AVM method of valuation. While this change resulted in an increase to our current provision, we do not expect it to have a material impact on the losses we will openly incur.","Turning now to the $67 million increase in the qualitative reserve. As we transition bank regulators from the OTS to the OCC, we are evaluating programs and practices that were designed in accordance with guidance from our prior regulator. While we were to align certain policies and procedures with the guidance of our new regulators, we have suspended certain modification programs that will require changes.","We anticipate this retooling process will take some time to complete. And as a result, we expect to execute fewer modifications in 2012.  Therefore, we increase the qualitative reserve to reflect additional estimated losses during this period of reduced activity in our modification programs, as well as uncertainty around certain loans modified under our previous programs. Once the necessary changes to these programs have been implemented, we will reassess the overall qualitative reserve to ensure it\u2019s at the appropriate level, always keeping in mind the guidance of our new regulators and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. As a reminder, the overall qualitative reserve also accounts for uncertainty in the performance of modified loans, as well as a variety of economic and operational factors not directly considered in the quantitative loss model. ","So to summarize, prior to the including the items I just described, net charge-offs for the quarter were $151 million and provision was $87 million, which compares favorably to last quarter's charge-offs of $157 million and provision of $98 million. Turning back to the performance of the portfolio. Loan charge-offs for the full year were $649 million, down 30% from 2010. The performance of our legacy loan portfolio continues to benefit from aggressive loss-mitigation strategies, including the use of servicers that specialize in troubled assets. Through 2011, we transferred a total of $3.2 billion of loans to higher touch servicers, including $850 million during the fourth quarter, completing the majority of plan transfers. These special servicers have historically been effective in reducing delinquencies through loan modifications and more aggressive outreach to borrowers.","With regards to the performance of our existing modifications, we saw stability during the fourth quarter in the average re-delinquency rate 12 months after modification, which was 29% for 1-4 Family loans and 42% for Home Equity loans. Additionally, we do not expect loan resets to be a material driver of credit costs as less than 1% of the 1-4 Family mortgage portfolio is expected to experience a payment increase of more than 10% during the year. And more importantly, nearly 70% are expected to reset to a lower payment. In total, we expect approximately $3.2 billion in 1-4 Family mortgages to reset in 2012, of which $1 billion are resetting for the first time.","With respect to capital, our position remains flat to last quarter's levels. For the year as a whole, the bank generated $411 million of regulatory risk-based capital and $228 million of Tier 1 capital. As of December 31, 2011, the bank's Tier 1 capital ratio is 7.8% and its risk-based capital ratio is 17.3%. In addition, our consolidated Tier 1 common ratio is 9.4%. Under Basel III in its current form, we estimate this ratio will also be approximately 9.4%, which is well above the 2019 fully phased in requirements. The primary difference in the Tier 1 calculation under Basel III is the capital treatment of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities, which will also make this ratio inherently more volatile than other capital ratios.","Turning now to dividends of excess capital out of our bank. As we stated last quarter, we have begun the process of requesting a more comprehensive dividend from the bank to the parent. Our thinking on the timing of this process has not changed, and our objective is to complete this dialogue sometime in 2012, after which, we should have a better idea on the timing of the dividend. However, we reiterate that the relationship with our primary regulator is very new, and we cannot predict the timing or likelihood of approval for any such dividends.","Corporate cash ended the year at $484 million or just under 3x our annual debt service. This increase of $46 million from the prior quarter related to settlements between the parent and subsidiaries for overhead cost-sharing arrangements, dividends from nonregulated subsidiaries and year-end tax settlements. Going forward, we would expect corporate cash to decline generally in line with our corporate interest expense. However, I would also point out that our parent houses roughly $500 million of deferred tax assets, which will ultimately become sources of parent cash as the company subsidiaries will reimburse the parent for the use of its DTA.","With that, I will turn the call back to Steve for closing remarks.","Steven J. Freiberg","Thank you, Matt. Before taking questions, I would like to share a few additional comments. As I said earlier, I feel positive about our franchise and headwinds, be as they may, we will continue to enhance our franchise position.","In addition to several new products in the pipeline for launch in early 2012, we are enhancing the way we position E*TRADE by broadening our advertising and platforms to better address both the trading and long-term investing needs of consumers. To that end, we have several new platforms and products ready or near ready for launch, including a completely new public website experience, our store front for prospects. Launched just weeks ago, we are currently directing just under 50% of visitors to the new site, and we expect it to be fully rolled out within weeks. In addition to a new look and feel, the site features streamlined information and digital design, clear pathing and differentiated experiences for distinct customer segments, plus tools for investment decision-making and guidance.","Our new customer site, E*TRADE 360, is in the final phase of testing with select new customers and is scheduled for a full franchise launch within a few weeks. We are very excited about this website, which makes online trading and investing faster, easier and more powerful by giving customers everything they need on one dashboard, the ability to choose and customize favorite features and a graphical view of accounts and the markets.","Retirement planning is a key priority for E*TRADE. And during the past couple of years, we have significantly enhanced our suite of products in our retirement planning center. And we are currently featuring this subject in our client education center. Our commitment to delivering best-in-class retirement experience was reinforced by Kiplinger's The Best of Everything 2011, where E*TRADE was recognized as having the best retirement planning calculator. ","Additionally, we have refocused our advertising messages beyond trading and extended our brand position to align with the needs of long-term investors. The advertising has evolved to showcase the full range of investing solutions available at E*TRADE.

Thus far in January, we have experienced an 18% sequential increase in DARTs compared to December. With respect to the loan portfolio, we believe it will continue to climb at roughly $600 million to $650 million per quarter. We expect delinquency trends to continue to improve, although the pause and certain modification efforts will likely impact net charge-offs in the near term.","We will continue to focus on executing our strategic plan, building on the progress and momentum we have generated over the past year. Specifically, we expect to increase the growth rate of net new brokerage accounts and customer assets, which in turn should drive growth in DARTs margin and brokerage cash.","Finally, given the macroeconomic uncertainty and the near-0 interest rate environment, we believe it is prudent to target expenses to be down mildly from 2011.","With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Daniel Harris of Goldman Sachs.","Daniel F. Harris - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to touch back here on the NIM. So I think that you said you expect that the average NIM for the year would be 200 -- it could be below 250 basis points. So as you see the 10-year -- or the yield curve as it stands today, how should we think about the progression of that through the course of the year, assuming that margin loans hold roughly in line here, around $5 billion?","Matthew J. Audette","Dan, it's Matt. So I think that -- you're correct, slightly below 250 for the year. And I think the best color, incremental color I can have is it's going to happen pretty quickly, so meaning Q1.","Daniel F. Harris - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then I wanted to talk a little bit about -- you gave some color around the ability to upstream capital to the parent. But as we think about the year and the debt that you have outstanding, specifically the 12.5s, what's the thought process around retiring those towards year-end, whether that's retiring or refinancing them in the market?","Matthew J. Audette","So we're absolutely focused on those, Dan. I think if you go back to last year, just looking at our ability to issue a refinance, we issued -- that 6 and 3 quarters back in May. The markets have definitely increased since then, but we feel like sitting here today, that refinancing those notes at the end of the year is absolutely something that we can do. It would mostly be our preference to upstream capital out of the bank and pay those off. But as they said in their prepared remarks, they had some dialogue that they were having with the regulators throughout this year. It's not something that we would have any additional color on today. But from a refinance perspective, we are absolutely focused on that.","Daniel F. Harris - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just lastly, I just want to talk to the expense guidance. So it sounds like what you're saying is all else equal, we should expect that the expense number in 2012, excluding any onetime items, would be below what we saw in 2011?","Steven J. Freiberg","That's correct.","Operator","You're next question comes from the line of Eric Bertrand of Barclays Capital.","Eric Bertrand - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The earnings release commented on the additional reserves and write-down being an important step, which from my seat would suggest that this is actually an evolutionary ongoing process. Do you frame the magnitude of potential further write-offs or valuation allowance that are under review? Or is this actually done and was just kind of a conservative statement?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure. Eric, it's Matt. So I think just a high level when we discussed in the release and the prepared remarks, so we were early in the stages of our transition from the OTS to the OCC. And as part of that transition, we were going through policies and procedures to make sure that we conform anything that under the OCC is that they either have either different guidance or different focus in the OTS side. And loan modifications is one of those areas. So as we discussed, we're working through making changes to those programs to make sure they're in line with what our regulators expect. But I think the key thing that I would highlight here is that's ongoing. So where we sit today, we expect that the $67 million increase to the qualitative reserve is appropriate for this quarter. But keep in mind the allowance itself is inherently uncertain and it's an estimate. And as we finish these changes, as we work through these discussions with our regulators, it could change in the future. But where we sit today, the $67 million increase is absolutely our best estimate.","Eric Bertrand - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Also in the prepared remarks, I believe Steve commented on a whole bunch of new products and services that are coming online over the next couple of weeks and seemingly needing advertising support. With that in mind, how do you envision at your ad spending footprint and geography over the course of the year?","Steven J. Freiberg","Yes. Let me comment on a few points. One, which I think I addressed in the prepared remarks, that it's the evolution of our advertising and hopefully in the playoff games and actually we'll kick off in the Super Bowl a new advertising. And you should see not only interesting advertising but advertising that covers both investing, as well as trading as we try to broaden out successfully the firm. That said, from the standpoint of spend, I would say our spend levels will more or less be in line in 2012 with roughly what we spent in 2011. Although what we do believe is that we learn and get smarter, and so the effectiveness and the efficiency of our spend should improve with the passage of time, but we don't see a material change. You may see some restratification of the change between media, between online and other promotion. But largely speaking, I would say, the spend in 2012 will be similar to the spend in 2011.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neil.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess the first question is obviously talking about expenses and the guidance of lower expenses. But if you looked at this quarter, Steve and Matt, the comp was higher than it's been in the couple of years. I know you've been adding people; I think that's probably what it is. But when you get pre-provision revenue at the lowest, you have to comp at the highest. Is that because of the added headcount? Or...","Steven J. Freiberg","I mean I think largely, it's one of the unique factors that Matt had addressed. If -- and it was in the prepared remarks that the expenses -- the onetime expenses, I'll let Matt go through it in detail, that had been advertised. But to review, the expectation was -- to the expend, these are development of expenses, the majority of what was ultimately a $9 million expense showed up in comp and bend [ph] for this particular quarter. So it distorted it. And Matt, you may want to share just another --  a different point on that?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes, sure. So Rich, the IDS [ph] items that I talked about in the prepared remarks, actually hit 3 different line items on the income statement. To Steve's point, the hit complement the most of $7 million but also increase professional services $3 million and it reduced depreciation and amortization by $1 million. So you take all those together, I think that's the $9 million that Steve commented on. And then ARS, Freudenberg reserve and the other items that I speak to, when you put all those together, it increase expenses in the $15 million to $16 million range. So if you exclude those, Q4 expenses are around $290 million, which I think for some time now we've talked about, we think that's about the right run rate for each quarter's expenses, and broadly, $1.2 billion for the year. And I think that's the focus we'll continue to have with the philosophy of get more efficient and save on noncustomer facing areas and invest in the customer facing areas, but keep things net flat to down.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Got it, that's very helpful. The -- and then Matt, you gave some, what do you call it, detailed guidance on the NIM for 2012. And I'm just going back, it was -- but you did -- the previous statement was 250 basis points over time, and we never really knew where the NIM reach that point. And you correctly pointed out that other people have a lot of brokerage, say, cash sitting on their balance sheets, that weigh down their NIMs, and that's why yours was 250 and someone else's was 180. But I guess the question is, if you strip out the, say, cash effects of some of these other guys, like that big competitor, now they're down to a run rate of more like 220. So your longer-term run rate in this kind of environment, where would that stand now?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure, Rich. So 250, the slightly below 250 was for 2012. I think if you -- especially given the Fed's comments today of keeping rates at near 0 through the end of 2014, when you get in, I won't be too precise to each year, but when you get beyond 2012 in that rate environment, it will definitely float down some more. And I think being very broad, I'd say 10 more basis points is probably as good an idea as any, but we don't see it being meaningfully below that.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then a very last question, Steve, I guess, bigger picture, given the Fed announcement today, when you gave your presentation at -- in conferences around year end, you talked about what a normalized -- the pretax could be in a better environment, higher interest environment, above $1 billion in pretax. Now the interest rate environment, this sort of pushes us back. Is there any modifications to your plan besides just it being pushed back by an outside force? Does the Fed impact any other plans as you march towards higher earnings rate?","Steven J. Freiberg","Let me try to answer the question if I fully understand. Just a couple of points, which I think help recognize your frame. One is spread is important, no doubt about it. Half of our revenues is net interest income more or less. I did say actually in my prepared remarks that even in 2011, where we did see, roughly speaking, on a full year basis 12 basis points of spread compression, we almost completely covered it with growing the franchise. So these are in aggregates. So absolute begets absolutes. But part of what we want to do, and it goes back to launching new prospect webs, new customer sites, smarter about our advertising is grow your business faster, so the volume basically offsets some of the rate compression, which by its very nature is likely, I think, to Matt's point. The second is if the environment were rough less challenging, let's talk about spread, we probably would be investing more to grow the franchise more rapidly, but we're constraining basically our expenditures in light of understanding the dynamics of expense revenue and provisioning. So what we're trying to do is to manage the business smartly and de-risk it in the context of the environment that we're facing, which is the same environment that our competitors are facing. And you'll see with the passage of time that if the environment shifts, if basically Europe gets some degree of buoyancy, maybe we see a different set of activity in trading, that will also generate typically an expansion of margin, that will change spread. We have over the next several years a fairly large book, which is clearly disclosed, a very expensive wholesale funding, which will roll off our balance sheet. We're repaying 4% and 5% for that money. So there's a lot of dynamics that run through, Rich. And part of what we think we do reasonably well is to understand those dynamics and try to find the best mix of that given the environment. But that said, if rates were going to stay absolutely low and flattish for 3 or 4 years, it will pressure the overall spread. And the question is how fast can you grow to get a volume offset or how smart can you be on changing somewhat of your balance sheet's strategy when you look out over the horizon. But that's -- I think, what we're trying to do here, which we haven't really done in the past, we started, I think, a quarter so back, is to give you a better sense of what we think the broad-based spread would be in an environment that stays relatively constant. And I think when Matt said in his prepared remarks, it said, \"assuming no change in balance sheet strategy and more or less the rate environment that we see at the moment.\"","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Howard Chen of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So besides the treatment of modifications, so what are some of the other programs and policies we should be watching that could be treated differently between the OCC and OTS?","Matthew J. Audette","This is Matt. So I think the comment I made earlier, it's early in the transition. And I think one of the key things that highlight the differences between the OTS and the OCC and the Fed is the OTS was more of an annual review program versus the OCC and the Fed are more in-residence, so the dialogue is more active. So we don't have anything additional to highlight today, other than to say that it's early in the transition, and we do have active dialogue with them.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Is this sequential in the sense that like you have to -- your OCC is your primary regulator today, and you need to conform with everything of theirs before you go to the Fed? Or is it all happening at the same time?","Matthew J. Audette","I think the OCC and the Fed work with each other quite well. So it's a in parallel thing.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just one more on this. During the prepared remarks, I thought I heard you say this quarter's reserve actions wouldn't affect your view on losses, but then I thought I heard Steve say at the end, it could impact charge-offs a bit. So did I miss something in all that?","Matthew J. Audette","So I think you might be focusing on the AVM comment, so to add a little bit more clarity there, the changes there was in our process to estimate the losses on loans when they're 180 days past due. So we added a refinement to that process, but we don't expect it -- any change to the ultimate losses we have once we foreclosed on the property and sell it. Meaning the ultimate severity is the 1-4, which we cover in the low 40%. We don't have a different view on that. We just had a refinement to the process that are 180 days delinquent.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I know your overall philosophy on securities gains vis-\u00e0-vis the provision expense, and that makes sense to me. I'm just hoping you could give us a flavor for what you continue to sell in this type of environment on the securities book and maybe how that's evolved over the last couple of quarters?","Matthew J. Audette","So there's really been no change. I mean the securities book, it's pretty much plain vanilla agency securities, so there's nothing different in there. And there's an active program to manage in this interest rate environment. I think the key theme, I think, we would leave you with is as we go back to 2009 and '10 where the gains overall were in the $150 million to $160 million range, our expectation is that floats down over time. And we saw that in 2011 that come down to $120 million. We would expect that trend of coming down to continue.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just final one for me, Matt. I mean just -- not to beat a dead horse, but on the spread guidance, not to look too far forward, but if you're saying another 10 basis points. I guess with the loan book burning down and assuming no change in the shape of the yield curve or rates going up, I just -- I still struggle a bit with why, like let's just say 240 is the floor in your mind. Can you just help kind of expand on that a little bit?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure. So I think Steve probably hit on the key item for us, and that we've got a rather large wholesale funding book, roughly $1 billion that we -- let's put in place back in '06 and '07, so it's got extremely high rates. So as that portfolio runs off, it is the big offset. So I think the headwinds that you're probably -- that have in your mind that would drive it below 240. So that's the big item, and that's our estimate. But of course as you know, as we go through -- time will tell, we'll see. But our best estimate is slightly below 250 for this year. And there could be another 10 basis points beyond that.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So I wanted to chat a little bit about the brokerage side of the business. What are you looking at on the brokerage side in terms of you're hiring for the Corporate Services group or some of the trends that you're seeing in your customers that maybe gives you some optimism that trade is going to be a little bit higher in 2012 than 2011? And what sort of traction do you think you're basically getting with the Corporate Services group? And how soon is that going to be reflected, do you think, in some of your performance?","Steven J. Freiberg","Yes, just a couple of points. One, we think the Corporate Services group had an extraordinary year in 2011. And we'll see in majority the fruits of that labor more in 2012 as the majority of those customers get boarded, it's basically [ph] a period between when you sign contracts and you actually bring them on. The volumes themselves, year-on-year going from '10 to '11, meaning new customer assets were probably close to double. And the pipeline, as I said earlier, is extremely thick. And so that business has just been on a tear. And the volume, though, we actually see trading volume. In a bullish market, remember what underlies this, are largely employees that have options and equity that will vest. And so that if the markets have been muted as they have been, you don't see a lot of option exercise. But once the markets move in a direction that is positive, we'd expect to see both the base, as well as the overlay of new client or new customers perform extraordinarily well. These are terrific companies with great prospects overall. So very optimistic, the volumes keep growing, meaning they sign contracts, new customers coming on. We keep enhancing the platform. We already believe it's the best platform in the industry. And I would say that business in '12, '13 should continue to basically contribute quite smartly. And the added benefit is, I think you all know, that the average commission per trade that we get out of that business is far superior to what we get out of basically the traditional retail business, so it helps mix in addition. So it's sort of a win-win. But that's been, again, nothing short of extraordinary.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And then my follow-up question, switching gears to your market making business. There has been an announcement by a couple of a relatively large investment banks that they're going to be entering the wholesale trading business. What sort of threat do you see that to your market making business? Because obviously, every little bit matters at this point. So how do you view the competitive environment in that area?","Steven J. Freiberg","We always respect any new competitors entering the industry. I've had a number of conversations with the people that run the market making side. I would say on a balance, we are confident that we will actually maintain or improve our share with the passage of time. We invested a fair amount in 2011, particularly in areas like colocation, where we moved essentially side-by-side with a number of our key clients to increase speed and execution, and we're seeing actually not only good takeup of that, but we think it's a good path for us to continue to grow. And again I'd never discount new competitors moving in. But we think by and large, we have scale, we have basically stated our capability and we'll continue to push on that. We also have the advantage of about half our flow onto that business is our own. And now about half our flow is third-party or external, and we're continuing to leverage both our own flow as well as scale. So I can't predict. We've seen this happened before. But I would say by and large, we prevailed and we continue to basically pick up share where we think it's important to pick up share. Just as you would also know, this is a business where not all volume is either effective and are good volume.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Murray of Nomura.","Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Can you just touch on the tax rate in the quarter? I mean it looks like you have $7 million of taxes on roughly $800,000 income?","Steven J. Freiberg","Well I'm going to let Matt take that one but obviously, we're good Americans. We pay more than our fair share.","Matthew J. Audette","Keith, it's Matt. The key reason there is our taxable income is slightly higher than our book income, and the key reason for that is there's a decent size portion of our corporate interest expense, specifically on the Springing Lien Notes. It's not deductible for tax. So while we have pretax income of just around $1 million, the amount of income we actually have to accrue taxes on is a much larger number. I think the best way to think about taxes over the long term is in the range of 40% to 44%. But anytime we're relatively close to breakeven. That nondeductibility in the Springing Lien Notes is going to make the reported rate look pretty interesting, like it did this quarter.","Steven J. Freiberg","And it just goes to the point that we -- or the question we answered earlier, clearly it's compelling for us when the opportunity arises, either to refinance a paydown, or some combination there, the Springing Lien Notes. Because not only does it carry 12.5% coupons and almost $1 billion of debt, but largely, they're tax inefficient in addition, so we get to pay twice. One is very high coupons, and the other is we don't basically get the benefit of tax deductibility, which is really not helpful. So for those of you who weren't aware, it's clearly the challenge of that legacy that we'd like to reduce or eliminate.","Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And then on the E*TRADE Bank's Tier 1 leverage ratio, it went down slightly in the quarter. And I noticed in one of the footnotes that mentions that other risk-weighted assets increased. Could you provide any color on that?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure. So specifically the Tier 1, so the risk-weighted asset change should really be on the risk-weighted ratio. And I think the key thing on the leverage ratio for the bank is that the overall amount of capital in the bank, that didn't change. It's roughly $3.4 billion. But our assets increased during the quarter, and that was driven by the increase in deposits through brokerage-related cash. So from a leverage ratio perspective, it comes down. We think that's a good thing in that perspective because we generated more brokerage cash. So that's the reason for the decline there.","Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And then last one. The 5% increase in the early stage delinquencies in Home Equity, I mean what's the key factor driving that? Is it a certain geography? Or what specifically have you guys seen?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. We would classify just even the overall increase and special mentioned delinquencies for the quarter at 2%, 5% of the Home Equity book. Q4 is typically a seasonally challenging quarter. So from our perspective, that 2% increase overall and then the 5% on Home Equity, keep in mind, it's less than $10 million, is a relatively good performance for Q4.","Steven J. Freiberg","Actually, just before we finish up the question, looking at -- basically coming off the same data, I think the context here is important across the year as well and notwithstanding that the fourth quarter tends to be a more seasonally challenged period, and we didn't see a lot of seasonality, which was positive. That if you look at the 1-4 Family, the actual current balances over the year came down about 15%. The delinquencies, though, 30.79 days, came down 30%. And if you look at the Home Equity book, the book is basically shrunk by 17% on the current across the year, but the delinquencies came down by 20%. And given these are liquidating portfolios, overall, that's not bad performance, if you'd expect typically liquidating performance on a relative basis to see a higher concentration of delinquencies with the passage of time. And we actually have experienced something of significantly less than that. I can't predict that's going to be the trend forever but nonetheless, it's not a bad trend when you look at your good volume coming down at a slower pace than your bad volume.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Harris of Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So in your prepared commentary there, you talked about the improved environment for the brokerage this year, at least relative to last overall performance. I know in the past you guys have talked about increasing your hit rates on converting web prospects to customers. Have you guys made any progress in this area? I know it seems like a pretty big opportunity for you, and really any data you can share on this would be helpful.","Steven J. Freiberg","Yes, just a couple of points. Just to confirm, we had 3 good weeks relative to December. So directionally, not so bad. But I get it, it's hard to predict with any degree of certainty of how much improved 2012 will be, but with that regarded optimistic, we're looking for some mild improvements. From the standpoint of statistics around conversion rates off the web, I don't have that at my fingertips. We can help you potentially offline with that. But I do want to emphasize one of the main reasons we've completely rebuilt our prospect or our public website is to maximize the throughput from gross to net prospects coming through that channel. We think if you go online -- now again we're only directing 50% of the visits to that, next several weeks we'll be up to 100%. What we're doing right now is a lot of basically testing, learning and refining, so that we optimize against essentially the new web. But that is the aim of years\u2019 worth of work. And maybe offline, we can get Brett to provide information that is in the public domain, but that's what we aim to do.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great, I'll follow-up after the call. And then I guess my second question here, just thinking about strategic opportunity for you guys, I know this always seems to come up. But any thought or progress about creating an RIA custodian business? Didn't know where that ranked in your strategic priorities, if at all, for the next year or so.","Steven J. Freiberg","Yes. I would say that it clearly is something that's on our radar. Today, we serve probably 200 or so RIAs. But it hasn't been, what I would say, the most strategic of the priorities for us. And so we understand the industry, we understand the growth in the industry. Clearly it's an area that over time we think to be important. But the world of prioritization, it's just not risen to the top of the priority list for '11 into '12. But I wouldn't discount in the period that would look out several more years that we wouldn't take a more aggressive stance there. But at this point in time, I wouldn't expect that to be a strategic high-priority focus for 2012. We have other things that we think provide us more income, more leverage, more opportunity, at least for the short term.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier of Deutsche Bank.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just maybe one more on expenses. If I look throughout the year, your net new assets, your account growth, like everything has been turning in the right direction. Headcount is up. And so when you say, like flat year-over-year, I'm just wondering, the areas that you're investing versus where you can pull back, like where should we look for that? Because it seems like the trends are good and it seems like the expenses are already pretty low. So there should be some investment.","Steven J. Freiberg","Yes. I think what you'd expect to see, which is what Matt and I have said now consistently, we'll continue to invest in, I'll say, sales and marketing, although as I said earlier I think marketing will be more stable year-on-year given that we up some spend between '10 in '11 on the marketing front. And I would expect to continue to increase our sales capability both in our international sales centers, as well as in our physical approximate branches. But again we're not talking about substantial amounts of investment. And obviously the complement to that is if we're going to decrease expenses overall, again to Matt's comments earlier, it's going to come from areas that have less customer impact or less strategic value to us, and we're squeezing on it. I think we run a reasonably efficient model at this point. There could be some big opportunities for us on the expense side, but probably not going to be realized in 2012. Obviously as the legacy loan portfolio goes down, we probably spend $75 million to $100 million in that area that today is necessary but tomorrow would not be. We know we pay very high FDIC insurance premiums. So as basically the company continues to de-risk and it improves its overall financial position on a whole bunch of metrics, I would expect that expense to come down substantially, again, with the passage of time. I know that Matt's going through that in excruciating detail. But that could be another $50 million, $60 million, $70 million as well. That's where the big opportunities are on the expenditure side, from the standpoint of either restructure and\/or efficiencies. But in the short term, we have to basically be, what I would say, we have to be in weeds and squeeze out expense that's not going to contribute, but reinvest it regardless of the environment in areas that we want to grow. And so -- but it's almost a full-time career for a lot of us, which is to continue to funnel it back into opportunity areas, and it's basically taken from where we think we get less value. It is a bit frustrating, though, there is some very large pockets that will take time likely to what I've just addressed, and I'm not sure if we can accelerate that in any material way.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And Matt, maybe just one more in the balance sheet. You mentioned on the wholesale funding that some of that rolling off. I guess any help there just on the timing of that, because obviously we can look at the environment and look at rates and how much that pressures your net interest margin. But on the funding side, when we think about -- as we're heading into 2013, like what portion of that can be replaced with cheaper funding?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure. It's not -- it's going to slowly trickle down in the coming years. When we put this funding back in '06 and '07, it was fairly long term, and it ended roughly 10-year range back then. So it's going to be years for it to flow down with little chunks here and there in the coming years. So it's going to be a long time.","Operator","You're next question comes from the line of Joel Jeffrey of KBW.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I think we've been through most of my questions out here, so I think I'll just ask a couple of housekeeping ones. Can you just talk a little bit about the decline in fees and service charge line? Is that just trading related?","Matthew J. Audette","It is. And that commissions, fees and service charges and principal transactions, all of those generally move in line with trading activity.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then I apologize if I missed this earlier, but can you give a breakdown of the DART's options, futures, that type of thing?","Steven J. Freiberg","Yes. I mean I think the simple breakdown in the quarter, roughly 22% of the trades were in either options or futures, obviously, heavily skewed to options. And the remainder were in either equities with a very small portion of the final complement in probably package products like funds.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Allen of Evercore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to ask quickly on the FDI insurance premium. Adjusting for the change in methodology, if those are running about $30 million a quarter for 2Q and 3Q and then obviously you dipped down  $25 million this quarter. Was there any change there? Or is this just a function of the loan book going down?","Matthew J. Audette","A little bit of both. So the quarterly FDIC insurance is always going to be our estimate for that quarter and a little bit of true up from the actual versus the prior quarter's estimate. We had a little bit of that in the fourth quarter as a credit or reduction. And then one of the things that drove the increase in the FDIC insurance premiums under its asset-based methodology was, call it, a surcharge, if you will, for certain types of loans. So as those loans come down, the FDIC insurance will come down as well. So I think that where we sit today at $25 million, it's not the run rate, it's a little bit higher, but it's a little bit less than $30 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell of ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but just a couple. Just one, you talked about refinancing the Springing Lien Notes obviously as sort of a primary target. Do you require regulator approval for upstreaming dividends from the bank in order to do that? Or is that -- can you possibly do it without up streaming capital from the bank?","Steven J. Freiberg","So 2 separate questions, right? One is absolutely we're require regulatory approval to move dividends between the bank and the parent. And from the standpoint of could we, would we refinance without basically upstreaming the dividends from one to the other, the answer is we believe that the market, this is in conversations with a number of our investment banks and relations, we believe that we would refinance regardless. Clearly we'd like flexibility, but to Matt's point earlier, this is a process that we cannot predict, meaning essentially the dividend process, we cannot predict timing with any degree of certainty.","Matthew J. Audette","And I would just to add, just look back at what -- our refinancing looking back in last May, there was no dividend approved for that. And so I think refinance is something we can do at the parent.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then the second question I had is just, Steve, if you could talk about sort of what your organic growth targets are? I don't know if you have sort of an official view of where you like them to be, if you look at your competitors over, let's say, maybe the next 1 to 2 years? And considering the momentum that you've got in the corporate client business and also overlaying the productivity of the new financial consultants that you've added this year and plan to add in 2012?","Steven J. Freiberg","Yes. I don't think we have a precise number. But what I would say is this year, 2011 -- this past year, 2011, we grew on a net basis, x-ing any market volatility or change, we grew net customer assets by approximately 7%, which was below Ameritrade and above Schwab, which we kind of look at when we have public data in as core competitors. And I would say, our goal would be to be at the top of the market, and we're not there yet. We're better than we were, and we're moving in the right direction. But I would say, the competitor in that was at the top of the market this year, probably grew in the low double digits, probably in the number around 11%, and we grew at 7%. I would say there's nothing wrong basically with our capacity over time to grow. One of the issues or challenges we have is that historically, we've been deemed to be more of an area to come to trade. So if you come to trade, you're going to bring a lot of assets, you bring your trading assets. We've been retooling, as I said, platforms, positioning, advertising, bringing in sales folks in order to essentially broaden out E*TRADE to be a great place to not only trade but to invest. If you come here to trade and invest, you bring more assets. We're already seeing, for example, new accounts generated from our financial consultants are about 6x larger than those that are coming through basically on their own. And so we're optimistic but this is -- I don't think you change the frame, we need to get to the top of the market in 6 or 12 months. So we're on a journey, but we're -- essentially we're not sitting here growing at once, hoping to grow in '11. We're in actually a decent position. And as we execute, we think it'll actually basically move higher, and that's our goal. But I don't have a number saying I wish we have 10% or 12% or 14%, I just think we have to be competitive to the point where we're as good as anybody we compete with.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right. So it sounds like obviously the fourth quarter was subdued because of the trading activity that you mentioned, and as we move into your better season of seasons coming into the year and some momentum from the corporate client business and the FCs, we should see that sort of mid-4% to 5% rate that you've had in the fourth quarter, could that move up to the high single digits during the year, would you say?","Steven J. Freiberg","And that's what we would expect, and as I said in 3 weeks, it wouldn't make a trend. But not only our DARTs basically up sequentially, the way we described it at 18%. But all the other metrics are moving more or less in concert with that. So you look at new accounts coming through on a net basis, you look at asset growth, if we can sustain this, and no guarantee can, things, will feel like, are reasonably good.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Fischer of CLSA.","Matt Fischer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","First off, when I look at -- in your Qs, you published the carry value versus fair value of your loans on a net basis. Do you -- in the third quarter it was like $1.3 billion, do you have that for the fourth quarter?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure. So I think if you convert that to a price in the loan during the low 90%, so we'll have that in the 10-K, but it improved slightly.","Matt Fischer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And when you say improved, it's shrinking?","Matthew J. Audette","Well, so the portfolio itself is shrinking every quarter but the price of the portfolio, so the fair market value versus the book value, that price has improved slightly in the fourth quarter versus the third.","Matt Fischer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. So slightly over 90%?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes, correct.","Matt Fischer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And as -- I guess there's some government programs to try to keep people at homes longer and with the extended period of lower -- period of lower rates. Do you -- obviously as the loan book shrinks, but also how do you look at that in terms of over time, how small -- how you close that gap and if you kind of see what you got in 2012 at least?","Steven J. Freiberg","So I think the question is the impact of any government programs on the loan portfolio. I think as a general statement, if we're doing anything there, it would certainly help us. But that's not something that we're counting on. We're managing the portfolio the way we have for the past several years, which is to minimize the credit losses associated with it as it pays down.","Matt Fischer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then with the -- you mentioned I believe the $600 million to $650 million per quarter in runoff on the loan book?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes.","Matt Fischer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And that's kind of -- you started $650 million and gradually work your way down? Or from the first quarter through the end of the year?","Matthew J. Audette","It's a range. I wouldn't be as precise as that. I think $600 million to $650 million is a good estimate for the quarters and the year.","Matt Fischer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And lastly, with you net new assets, any -- could you give some color in terms of new versus existing clients and where the accounts that are coming in your new accounts, just where are you getting this traction from?","Steven J. Freiberg","So as far as the mix, we don't break it out. It definitely comes from both, both new customers and existing customers. And I think where we're getting those customers from, I think it's the broad trend of investors movement from the traditional offline space to the online space is where we see our growth from.","Steven J. Freiberg","I mean just to add a little bit more color, and this is and it clearly changes, probably about 1\/3 of our accounts are coming from brand new customers, about 2\/3 are coming from existing customers. Obviously, our focus is expanding relationships with customers, and that's basically playing through the system. Clearly it's stratified differently. If it's coming through the sales channel, it tends to be a much larger account. If it's coming through, what I'd say, the marketing channel tends to be a smaller account but typically grows with the passage of time. And for your last question, how does Corporate Services group work through that? It is very important because broadly speaking about 25% to 30% of our new customers over the course of time come through that channel at a very low cost per account, although you tend not to get your very active traders out of the channel. By varied definitions, hopefully that kind of gives you more or less a frame.","Operator","This concludes the allotted time for today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the floor back over to Mr. Steven Freiberg for any closing remarks.","Steven J. Freiberg","Operator, thank you very much. And all I want to say then is thank you again for joining us tonight, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter, and have a good evening.","Operator","Thank you.

No other recordings or copies of this call are authorized or may be relied upon.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Idzik. Please go ahead, sir.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good evening and thank you for joining us. The third quarter was busy with customer engagement demonstrating a bimodal distribution, high engagement during the market turmoil, bracketed by a muted trading activity in the rest of the quarter. Beyond this, we took yet another confident step on the capital front with the termination of legacy wholesale funding, which will significantly enhance forward earnings power, but came with one-time charges. Excluding those, we posted net income of $98 million or $0.33 per share. Our results also reflected better than expected credit trends and performance as we reached an inflection point in the loan portfolio, releasing reserves for the first time since the portfolio transitioned to runoff more than eight years ago.","During the quarter, we continued to enhance our brokerage products and services, boosting capabilities on our professional trading and mobile platforms. We continued to tighten our focus, making the choice to discontinue the last of our international local operations, and exit a pair of ancillary products. Both of these actions continue to reflect our dislike of asymmetric risks. We have also further sharpened our pencils on capital deployment and in the wake of several felicitous steps made to-date, we will share an update to our thinking on future uses later in this call.","Also in early August, we were upgraded a rare three notches to investment grade rating by Standard & Poor's. We are obviously pleased that our corporate ratings are beginning to reflect the progress we've made and where we are as a company. As for our metrics, we reported 156,000 DARTs, up 4% from Q2 as an intra-quarter spike in volatility propelled customer trading during a typically slow period. Amidst the volatility in volumes of August 24, we processed a full day's worth of activity in the first hour of trading, and posted an all-time record with 394,000 trades on the day. The ability to handle flow of this magnitude is a true testament to the work we've completed over the last couple years to strengthen our foundation, including a hearty bolstering of our tech and operations infrastructure.","Options as a percentage of total DARTs held steady at 23%, at level relatively consistent with the past couple of years. And trades through our mobile applications represented a record 15% of total trading activity, having doubled over the past two-and-a-half years. Over one quarter of our unique logins came through this channel. We again enhanced our capabilities on this front as we aim to deliver an experience that rivals the best of digital, be it desktop, tablet, smartphone or smart watch. And finally on trading, October DARTs are tracking relatively flat with September.","Margin balances ended the quarter at $7.9 billion, down only 2% from Q2 despite a more substantial decline in the equity markets. However, we've seen a slight pullback in Q4 to date with balances currently at $7.5 billion. Excluding the impact of discontinuing our global trading platform, we added 19,000 net new brokerage accounts during the period. Adjusted attrition for the quarter was 9.3%. Net new brokerage assets were $2.1 billion during the quarter, down slightly from the year-ago period, but more than double the prior quarter.","As we think about E*TRADE's growth, we continually refine our focus. Last quarter, we made a decision to sunset our global trading platform, which is nearly complete. This quarter, we made the decision to wind down our brokerage operations in Hong Kong and Singapore in consideration of the level of requisite investment to maintain a competitive platform, while continuing to meet the prudential standards of both local and U.S. regulators. The opportunity simply didn't justify the demand on resources. We're in the early stages of this process and are determining which, if any, of the accounts we'll continue to service from the U.S.","Our business in Hong Kong and Singapore comprised of approximately 25,000 accounts, with assets of around $1.8 billion. Also this quarter, we discontinued our FX offering as it was not core to our product suite. We previously facilitated customer FX activity through a third-party broker, which linked to our platform for account visibility only. The only true change for customers resulting from our de-linking these accounts is that their FX transactions and account information will no longer be visible through our platform. There was no impact to our account metrics resulting from this change.","To dial in more closely on our products and services, being a best-in-class, digitally-centered broker means continuing to raise the bar when it comes to the customer experience on our various platforms. To that end, I'm pleased to review some of the key improvements made this quarter. We continue to expand the capabilities of our active trader platform E*TRADE Pro, this quarter, making a series of significant enhancements to our Options Analyzer. Beyond the new streamline design, the revamped tool enables traders to build multiple options strategies, run through various strike and date scenarios, customize graphing features more easily and seamlessly send any strategy directly to trade execution.","We also added capabilities to our industry-leading mobile applications, including capitalizing on new Apple Watch functionality. Moreover, we launched conditional orders and rolling options for our core smartphone apps. For the more long-term investors, we made strides in enhancing our tablet functionality, particularly around mutual fund transactions. This is of particular note as the importance of mobile investing continues to extend beyond the realm of the active trader. It's become an increasingly critical channel for all investor types.","When it comes to accolades, which I'm never reluctant to trumpet during these calls, we have a few to report. First, we won best overall IRA provider and best IRA for beginners by NerdWallet in their summer 2015 review. We were the only broker to win in two categories. Next, NerdWallet recently rated our mobile platform five out of five stars, highlighting our data and research functionality, Web-level capabilities, easy trade execution and availability on many devices as reasons why we are best in class. Finally, I'm also delighted to announce that for the fourth consecutive year, E*TRADE Corporate Services was rated #1 in customer satisfaction and loyalty by Group 5 with an impressive 92% satisfaction rating.","With respect to our progress on the capital front, this quarter witnessed a major accomplishment with the elimination of our longstanding legacy wholesale funding obligations, a non-core component of our balance sheet that had long been in a slow runoff. To give you some context, from 2005 to 2008 with a very different balance sheet strategy in place, the company committed to future funding in the form of club advances and repurchase agreements. The manner in which this funding was structured made it less valuable in the event of a downward shift in either rates or balance sheet size. The unprecedented low rate environment, coupled with our own deleveraging, made this funding source quite burdensome in terms of its high effective cost and its occupation of balance sheet capacity and valuable capital. The relatively meaningful costs of terminating this funding were a gating factor.","However, as we continued to naturally reduce in size, and as we generated healthy levels of capital, we got to a place where we were able to absorb the acceleration of these charges. In doing so, we immediately reduced our funding costs, transforming to a balance sheet funded predominantly by core, strategically important customer deposits, and providing capacity to onboard more of these value deposits, powerfully improving our earnings potential.","We're broadly in our capital and financial plan. We've accomplished a lot. And the fruits of our labors have included a more efficient organizational structure, greater capital flexibility, as well as improved regulatory standing and credit ratings. Since we first submitted the capital plan in 2012, we've distributed more than $1.3 billion of capital to the parent and completed two major initiatives: debt reduction and wholesale funding elimination, which collectively improved our earnings power by close to $190 million annually.","Today, we remain just as diligent about effectively deploying capital. And as we progress down the list of available options, it naturally becomes shorter and more focused. To walk through what remains, starting with balance sheet growth, we're now targeting a balance sheet size just shy of $50 billion, and we intend to reach that early next year. With the flexibility provided by our new sweep deposit platform, running within $500 million of that target is a highly achievable goal. The return here are attractive, and Mr. Pizzi will run through our status on this initiative.","Also on the list is returning capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks or dividends. While this has long been considered, the recent upgrade of our debt to investment grade, there's some constraints around absolute quantum. While the value of deploying capital in this manner is definite, we must weigh it against options that can benefit the longer-term value of the franchise or provide strategic energy via inorganic growth.","Acquisition was excluded from our narrative for many years, as we focused on improving our capital levels and regulatory standing. And today we are paying appropriate attention to the external opportunities to bolster our market position without getting distracted by bright shiny objects.","Regarding deployment of our owners' capital, management and our board carefully filter all opportunities, ensuring our heightened standards for risk, our demonstrated commitment to creating value for shareholders and our regulatory standing are at the forefront of any decisions. And while nothing is imminent, I wanted to update our shareholders on our capital approach as progress across multiple dimensions has delivered us to a place where E*TRADE can shift firmly to its front foot regarding growth and value creation.","To sum it up we've made a lot of progress. And we are keenly aware of all the work it took to get where we are. Our mandate is to precipitously maintain and build upon this position.","Lastly, it is bittersweet for me to announce that our President, Navtej S. Nandra, will be departing the company at the end of the year, having completed his mission as my lead change agent. When I arrived at E*TRADE in 2013 with sight set on getting our house in order, I knew we needed to leverage a persistent and meticulous leader who could intensively focus on our structure and execution, better aligning our capabilities and platforms and shoring up our resources and processes.","I'll be the first to admit that these were some bold ambitions, which often required a powerful microscope and unrelenting resolve. Mr. Nandra was uniquely qualified to lead the work and helped instill a culture of excellence from top to bottom.","Making changes of this nature certainly do not happen overnight. With Navtej's help the vast majority of this work has now been accomplished. With a reenergized and more productive E*TRADE now a reality, Navtej and I agree that now is the right time to flatten our leadership structure. Above all for a company of E*TRADE's size, it's the prudent thing for us to do for our shareholders. Indeed I will miss his leadership and insight, but I'm certain that Navtej's contributions will have a positive and lasting impact on E*TRADE for years to come.","And now with that I will hand the call over to our percipient CFO, Mr. Pizzi.","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Mr. Idzik. To make things as clear as possible, I'll start by walking through the impact of the wholesale funding transaction as it was truly a one-time event, and then move to our results. The action, which resulted in the elimination of $4.4 billion of legacy funding obligations, reduced our net income by $251 million or $0.86 per share. On a pre-tax basis the $413 million charge consisted of two parts: first, a $370 million loss included in net revenues; and second, $43 million of early extinguishment of debt.","Now onto our core results. Excluding the impact of the wholesale funding transaction, we reported adjusted earnings of $98 million or $0.33 per share. That compares to adjusted $72 million or $0.25 per share in the prior quarter, which excluded a $220 million tax benefit. It also compares to $86 million or $0.29 per share in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted revenues were $443 million, consistent with $445 million in the prior quarter and $440 million in the year-ago quarter.","Net interest income of $263 million was down $4 million from the prior quarter, as a $2 billion decrease in average assets offset the 8 basis point improvement to spread, mostly attributable to the wholesale elimination. Commissions, fees and service charges and other revenue were $170 million, up 2% from both the prior quarter and the year-ago quarter, largely due to the increase in total trading activity related to both periods. Average commission per trade of $10.87 declined $0.09 from the prior quarter and $0.18 from the year ago. The changes from both comparable periods were primarily driven by fewer stock plan trades. Fees and service charges revenue of $52 million decreased $3 million sequentially.","Adjusted net gains on securities were $10 million, in line with the prior quarter and at the high end of our $5 million to $10 million range, as we actively were selling securities in connection with our wholesale funding termination. Going forward, there is no change to our expected range with the current rate environment likely to keep us near the high end.","Operating expenses were $293 million, down from $309 million in the prior quarter, which included $6 million of severance and $9 million related to a contract amendment. Excluding severance in Q2, compensation increased $11 million sequentially, related to hitting some incentive compensation performance thresholds. FDIC declined $4 million sequentially, reflecting the full-quarter impact of our reduced assessment rate that went into effect in mid-Q2. With the balance sheet of just under $50 billion, $7 million is a good quarterly run rate for this line. And lastly, communications expense increased $5 million sequentially, which included approximately $3 million of one-time vendor expense.","As for expenses going forward, we expect Q4 to be around $305 million, including severance, putting our full year right around a 5% increase over 2014, in line with our original guidance. Advertising, in particular, should increase meaningfully in Q4, consistent with our normal seasonal patterns.","One last line of the P&L. Adjusted early extinguishment of debt was a $4 million gain, which related to the repurchase of 14 million of trust preferreds at a discount. We now have $414 million outstanding, of which 25% of the total balance is included in Tier 1 capital at the parent through year end. While the remainder is not incredibly high on our list for capital deployment given their long-term duration and relatively low cost funding costs, we closely monitor their market for any prudent opportunities to buy them in.","Moving onto the loan portfolio, it ended the quarter at $5.3 billion, down $370 million or 7%. In addition to the fast pace of the portfolio runoff, loan delinquency and net charge-offs continued to trend positively. A significant volume, $173 million of HELOCs, reached their end of draw and converted to amortizing loans this quarter. However, we only have first payment data from around 25% of those loans, as many converted later in the quarter. To-date, loan delinquency and losses related to interest-only HELOC borrowers converted to amortizing payments has been better than expected. As a result of positive trends in our portfolio, we reduced the allowance to $376 million or 7.1% of total loans at the end of Q3. The lower ending reserve balance, combined with only $1 million in net charge-offs, resulted in a $25 million provision benefit for the quarter.","A few factors contributed to the lower level of net charge-offs and reduced reserve balance. First, the pace of portfolio runoff is reducing our future loss forecast and the related reserves. Specifically, the early payoff on balloon loans prior to maturity is a prominent contributor to the lower allowance. Second, we continue to benefit from a steady level of recoveries through collection efforts and the recapture of prior write-downs upon pay down. Third, over the course of the past couple years, we identified subsets of high-risk loans within our portfolio where we reserve the full life loss expectation. The performance of many of these loans has exceeded our original expectations.","While we are pleased with the performance to date, we will obtain more meaningful data during Q4. While results have been better than expected, it is still too early to make changes to our estimates for future performance. At the moment, however, with strong recoveries, we expect Q4 as well as full year 2016 provision expense to be near zero, noting that this can vary meaningfully for a number of reasons.","Moving onto capital, following the successful extraction of our clearing broker from the bank on July 1, we spent the first two months of Q3 focused on ensuring our capital and liquidity position was strong. Once satisfied, in early September, management and the board agreed the bank was in position to execute on the termination of wholesale funding obligations.","Now diving a bit deeper into the details, with a cost of approximately 330 basis points, well above our blended yield on assets and considering it displaced one basis point customer deposit that could be on the balance sheet, the decision to eliminate this funding was clear from the value creation standpoint. We just needed sufficient excess capital in the bank entity to absorb the upfront charge, while maintaining our targeted 9% Tier 1 leverage ratio. Accordingly, we demonstrated what we \u2013 we downstreamed $110 million of parent capital, offsetting the $114 million dividend we completed earlier in the quarter and reduced our balance sheet size.","Given that regulatory calculations for bank capital are based on average assets, we wouldn't capture the full benefit of the latter action until Q4. Accordingly, we started Q4 with approximately 100 basis points of excess capital, resulting from starting the period with lower average assets. We fully intend to utilize the capital and balance sheet capacity and have begun the process of moving customer deposits from third parties back on our balance sheet. Since quarter end, we have moved $1.25 billion.","We intend to onboard an additional $2 billion of deposits by the end of this quarter. By early next year, we expect our consolidated balance sheet size to reach our targeted $49.5 billion, giving us an appropriate buffer to the daunting SIFI threshold. For clarity, the target is for our consolidated balance sheet size, and interest-earning assets currently run about $4 billion lower, as they do not include goodwill, intangible assets, PP&E and the DTA, among other items.","Returning to the impact this had on our metrics, spread was 258 basis points for the quarter and would have been approximately 245 basis points, pro forma, for the wholesale elimination. For Q4, if we hold today's rate environment constant and consider the current level of margin balances, we would expect spread to be in the high 270 basis point range on average interest earning assets of $40 billion.","Lastly, with respect to corporate tax, we ended the quarter at $432 million, an increase of $26 million, largely attributable to the $30 million dividend from E*TRADE Securities. We also had some movement of capital between the bank and parent during the quarter. We dividended Q2 net income of $114 million up to the parent, but then subsequently downstreamed $110 million of capital to the bank in conjunction with the wholesale termination. As a reminder, we will not request a dividend from the bank to the parent in Q4 as the bank reported a Q3 net loss of $186 million. We will resume quarterly dividend requests in Q1 of 2016. So, in summary, we remain well positioned from a capital standpoint and are committed to continue putting that capital to work for our shareholders.","And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah. Good evening, Paul. Good evening, Mike. I guess my first question is related to the reserve and your guidance on provision for next year. Prior, it was from zero to 20%, and in the near term at the lower end. And I guess the guidance was for it to accelerate with the amortization. So, now the guidance being zero, I'm just trying to see, it didn't sound like \u2013 you did have a slight better performance in the amortization. But I guess a little bit more color on the confidence that gives you the support to guide to the zero provision.","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer","Rich, I'll start off with \u2013 we took a reserve for the life of loan expectations on the high-risk portion of HELOCs. We have seen full payoffs coming out of that portion of the portfolio. In addition to that, we have seen the portfolio accelerating in prepayment speed, so speeds faster than we had originally modeled. All of this creates a backdrop in which the risk in the portfolio is reducing. In addition to that, there's a segment of portfolio of balloon loans that we are continuing to see prepayment activity from as well. And as you know, they become fully \u2013 they become payable in full on their balloon date. All of these factors combined really to put us in a position to reduce the allowance this quarter.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. And the question was the guidance going forward. So is \u2013 can you take away that we're over this \u2013 and again, Paul used the word inflection point in regards to credit in the prepared remarks. Are we beyond \u2013 should we look now back at this risk of the amortization of the portfolio?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer","Well, the bulk of amortizations are still in front of us. The subset of loans that we have seen come through is outperforming our expectations to date. And we have about $173 million that occurred in the quarter, of which we have 25% first payment on, or 25% of those loans, we have a zero to 30% delinquency estimate on.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Got it. Okay. I guess my last question is for Paul. And you've talked about what \u2013 and hinted at potentially things you can do with capital, including acquisitions. And I guess not \u2013 but to stay on the acquisition side of it. What things make sense to you, what size? And I would think if it isn't going to be in that retirement savings and investment area, can you give us some, I guess, flavor, what things you're looking at in a broad sense?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, certainly, and thanks for joining the call, Rich. It's always nice to hear from you. Rich, one of the reasons we talked about acquisitions is just so that we're really clear that now that we're at a different level of regulatory standing, it's prudent for us to be thinking about those things and trying to drive to long-term shareholder values.","So, I'd say it falls across three broad \u2013 three generic categories. The first would be finding ways to add capacity in the brokerage space because of the value of scale in that part of our business. And quite frankly, they're very attractive operating leverage. The second would be to add things more broadly in the retirement, investing and savings space, the robo space, adding things to help our E*TRADE Corporate Services business, provide a greater level of products and services. And so, that's a bit of a little more of a multi-colored opportunity, if you will. And then, the third would be in banking space in order to do a better job on monetizing the value of our customer deposits and to more broadly serve the Wealth segment that we currently serve through brokerage. So I hope that lays out the landscape, Rich. In terms of size, don't have any view on size.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","That's helpful, Paul. I know you can't get too specific, but congrats on moving the ball forward here again, guys. Thanks.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Rich.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Conor Fitzgerald with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Conor B. Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good afternoon.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Conor.","Conor B. Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Just on slide 18 if I look at kind of the expectation for $45 million a quarter of NII on sweeping on six \u2013 call it $6.4 billion of deposits, kind of implies an incremental net interest margin of $280 million. I guess is that the right way to think about your incremental NIM on sweeping it over?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Think about the marginal rate of investment for the portfolio as about 175 basis points to 225 basis points funded at a basis point. So if you look at just the marginal activity of new balance sheet, not looking at sort of the reduction of the expense from the termination event, that's really how to think about marginal activity. That's sort of the duration match to value of those sweep deposits that are coming back on.","Conor B. Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then maybe just going back to the M&A comment for a moment. Can you just help us kind of understand how \u2013 I mean any deal would obviously presumably take you over the $50 billion threshold. Can you kind of get us \u2013 if even if it was not capital-intensive, because there would be goodwill, can you just give us \u2013 help us understand I guess why you're comfortable? What the threshold would be for you to do a deal if it's going to involve you going through CCAR?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well it would only necessarily take us above $50 billion if we were to acquire a mythical being. Since we're not sort of thinking about this right now and to diligence away (28:56), if we acquired something with significant customer deposits. And as I said many times in previous calls when this topic comes up, none of our owners are going to reward us by tiptoeing over $50 billion and incurring all the costs and distraction. If we go over $50 billion, it will be when Mr. Pizzi and I and the rest of the team are confident that it's going to make sense for our owners.","Conor B. Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. And then maybe just sneak in one more if I could, just on the broader markets. Just be curious, from your seat, how you thought the markets performed on August 24 for the retail investor? I know there were some issues with ETFs, et cetera. But I would just be curious from your seat, what you saw? And how you thought the markets performed under stress?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well we were pretty focused on making sure we were doing what was right for our customers. And we were pretty happy with our performance. As I said, we handled a full day's trades within the first hour on the 24th. And we actually during that period of time, Conor, saw our customers be net buyers. They bought $0.75 billion during that time. So with the VIX down 30% in mid-August and lots of other things happening, we were just focused on helping our own customers. And we were happy to be able to do that.","Conor B. Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steven Chubak of Nomura. Please go ahead.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi. Good evening.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Steve.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","So given the significant progress you guys have made in terms of improving the credit loss and delinquency metrics on the loan portfolio, just looking beyond 2016, how should we think about the long-term Tier 1 leverage target that you guys could potentially manage to? Do you think it's a realistic expectation that you can get closer to some tier targets that have been laid out, closer to 7%?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer","Well as we discussed in the past in our capital plan, we see the target coming down from 9% by about 50 basis points per year in conjunction with the reduction in the riskier assets of the loan portfolio, as we move through the end of draw. So our capital plan contemplates 50 basis points decline. And we are working very closely on that right now.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. But it's still too early to make any determination as to whether we should think about incremental 50 bp declines in the years beyond that?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer","Well the plan goes on to \u2013 for an additional 50 bps the subsequent year, down to about an 8%. Beyond that, we're sort of outside the range of that plan. And really we'll continue to think about that as we update our current plan for the current year.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks. And, Paul, I appreciate the color you're giving on some of the acquisition opportunities you consider. One of the things where \u2013 one of the areas where we have seen strong growth within your business is the managed asset offering, if you will. And at the same time you're still relatively subscale.","I just wanted to get a sense as to whether you saw any relative attractiveness in some of the independent broker-dealers or advisory platforms, some of which appear to be on the block today. Is that a capability you would add? Or is it simply something that you're reluctant to do, given uncertainties surrounding the regulatory proposals like the Department of Labor?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think \u2013 as I said we're thinking about things across those three generic frames. People bring opportunities to us. I'm delighted to say that one of the best things Mr. Pizzi and I do is tell them we're not interested. But people do drag things past our desk. There are these other people in investment banks as you know who try and make a living that way.","So we would look at them if it made sense. I do agree with you that it makes sense for some of the dust to settle and see how things shake out before we were to enter into something with that degree of regulatory uncertainty.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks. And maybe just one more for me. You mentioned the banking space would be one area where you might look to do a better job with monetizing value of customer deposits and maybe expanding that capability inorganically. Can you just speak in general terms as to what one of those opportunities could potentially be, I suppose? I don't really necessarily see direct or clear synergies with a traditional banking platform with the platform you guys currently operate.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I'm not going to speculate on what type step we might make into that field. As I said, all of this we brought up on the call because we feel it's our responsibility to make sure that our owners know which way the management team is spending its time. The vast majority of time we're spending trying to serve our customers, making sure we're executing on the things we said we would, and drive value to the bottom line. So, we're just trying to be as transparent as possible, and I hope that we can continue doing so.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Well, we certainly appreciate the transparency. And that's it for me. Thanks for taking my questions.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Hey, guys. First question relates to capital. The 100 basis points of excess you talked about that should be hitting in Q4. Is that enough to get you guys to where you need to be to get the balance sheet up to $49.5 billion? Or are you assuming other capital sources to kind of make the bridge there?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. As we've highlighted before, that's the 100 basis points results from the lower average balance that's going to be in Q4. So as we take the balance sheet back up, we are going to deploy that. Where we come out \u2013 we had a prior question about our capital plan and sort of what the leverage ratio for the bank is, where we come out on that will determine our ability in terms of the needed capital to get to $49.5 billion.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then just a procedural question related to the capital, when does the 50 basis point step-down potentially take affect if the approval goes through? Is it sort of beginning of the year? Is it throughout the year? Is it the end of next year? I'm just trying to gauge the timing of when that might benefit you?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer","Well, our plan contemplates it for the beginning of the year, but obviously there's a regulatory approval process that we have to work through. So that's essentially how we have modeled it. That's what we're working towards, but there is a process, and it does require explicit approval.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then I guess last question here from me, the assets that came off the balance sheet, can you guys help us out? What the average yield on those assets were? Maybe just a range if you don't have an exact number?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. They were consistent really, very close to the average portfolio yield, slightly higher, that's contributed to some of the portfolio yield and the declining of the AFS portfolio, but really not far outside the average yield of the AFS portfolio.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys. Just on the expenses, you gave some color on the fourth quarter. I just want to get a sense, when you look at the outlook for 2016 based on some of the revenue drivers that you're going to be seeing, both from growing the balance sheet and then the provision guidance, I just wanted to get a sense on what we should be expecting when you look at kind of the investment outlook versus just the core run rate?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. This is something Paul and I have been spending a lot of time talking about as we work through our budget process for next year. It'd be a little easier if we had clarity on the rate situation or rate environment that we're going to face in terms of fed funds, as you know we are a pretty asset sensitive business. We'll have more to say about that in January, after we finalize our plan for the year, but right now it's a little bit early to be giving that information.","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, just on the capital side, when you think about the cash level that you have currently, and then as you continue to build, you know, when you look into 2016, is there a certain level that the cash could get to that we should be thinking that buybacks may come into play versus, say, something on the M&A side? Meaning, I know you want to keep all your options open, but is there a certain level where cash kind of continues to creep higher, where you say it's attractive enough to do buybacks at that point in time versus continuing to kind of navigate or scan the industry for growth areas?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","As we discussed in our prepared remarks, we really understand and appreciate the value of buybacks, and we're considering that option in the context of all the other things we discussed. And we understand the absolute definite value of it. We've established what I consider to be really respectable cadence on capital stewardship and intend to continue in that tradition. So I don't think you'd see us harboring cash just in case or just with a twinkle in our eye.","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ken Hill with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon, everyone.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Mr. Hill.","Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","You guys have talked a lot I think in the past about the Stock Plan business and keeping assets on the platform after they vest. I think historically it's running on the 15% range. Is that where it's at today? And what are you guys hearing from customers who are actually leaving? What kind of services are they going after? And is that something, or a capacity you could maybe add either organically or through acquisition?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We keep a close watch on our attrition. We do understand many of the drivers. We actually do not believe we need acquisitions to remedy some of the reasons people leave. And so, no, that's not something that is driving any of our thinking other than the current efforts to execute better for our customers. Regarding this 15%, some of the hiring we've done in the last quarter has been explicitly aimed at improving the stock plan participant experience, as a way to start nudging up that 15% number.","Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And I just wanted a follow-up real quick on an expense one. I think, Mike, you mentioned that rates is going to be a determinant of some of the expense trajectory into next year. What areas might you see more investment in, I guess, if you see a higher rate environment versus a lower rate environment where you could see maybe potentially some pullback?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I'll take that if you don't mind, Ken. We've spent a lot of money in the past period of time in the risk management and audit area, sort of affectionately known as the second and third lines of defense. And I think we've pretty much reached homeostasis there. We've really been focusing our efforts now on things that will help grow the company faster, and that is primarily in adding customer service capacity as we go towards the end of the year and into the tax \u2013 the front of the tax period at the beginning of next year, as well as IRA season. So FCs and customer service reps as well as from the tech dev space. So that's where we're focusing most of our hurrying now I'd say in the second half of last year and beginning of this year, we also focused attention on improving our capabilities and technology infrastructure.","Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Hey thanks. Good afternoon, everyone.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Devin.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","One area of uncertainty I think with the DOLs fiduciary rule is options trading within retirement accounts, and whether that will be allowed? I'm assuming the majority of that activity occurs outside of IRAs, but can you help frame any potential impact to E*TRADE if that isn't allowed? And then just with the DOL rule seeming to continue to roll forward here, is there anything else that you guys are looking at that may have an impact?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Devin, I don't think we're prepared to comment on that today.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. No problem. And secondly on just NIM expectations, I appreciate the commentary. If we're in a flat interest rate environment, obviously the marginal reinvestment rate is going to be lower than the current securities yields, and particularly as higher yielding securities are rolling off. So is there anything that you would look to do to maybe support your NIM further either in the types of security that you're purchasing? Or in the duration profile?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Devin, I'm not prepared to comment on that either this evening. But Mr. Pizzi is.","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer","Look, we try and match the duration liability of our sweep deposits pretty closely. That marginal reinvestment rate right now is about between 175 basis points and 225 basis points. We try and keep a very low overall level of exposure to interest rates, keeping in mind that we have a significant number of mortgage assets. So there is a degree of shifting as rates move. We really don't see that changing over time.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then just last on fees and service charges, a little lighter than I was looking for. Transaction activity up, client assets down, so it was just a function of the lower balances? Or anything else we should be thinking about moving forward?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer","Two items. During the second quarter we get some proxy rebate fees that go through that line. We don't have those in the third quarter. The other item is related to FX related transactions from corporate services. Those were lower in the period.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Okay, got it. Okay, thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Allen with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Christopher John Allen - Evercore Group LLC","Evening, guys. Just thinking about the $50 billion threshold, and if you move past that, that would require a higher regulatory reporting and personnel cost, I would imagine. I'm just wondering where do you guys think you stand in terms of those capabilities? What incremental costs you would face if you were going to go through that barrier over the current run rate? If you can give us any color on that, that'd be great.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Chris, we're far from being near that point or contemplating it. We've pretty much laid out our thinking on this. As we get to a point where we think we can leap over, we'll machine those numbers. But certainly when you read commentary such as by Zions Bank and some of the other ones, you recognize that these are not inexpensive moves to make. And we certainly wouldn't make a move of that nature without careful consideration and running Mr. Pizzi's slide rule over the numbers several times.","Christopher John Allen - Evercore Group LLC","All right. That's it for me, guys. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brian Bedell. Please go ahead.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Mike, just on the fourth quarter in net interest margin assumptions, what are your assumptions for the home portfolio yields? I saw they went up to 4.24%, 4.25% (45:17). I guess first of all what were the drivers of the yield going up to 4.25% from 3.90%? And then also the margin loans went up also almost about 7 basis points or 8 eight basis points to around 3.50%. So in your guidance on NIM for 4Q, are those your same assumptions as what's happened in 3Q? And if you can talk about the drivers of that?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. In the loan portfolio first, we had some items that moved through there last quarter that took the yield a bit lower related to some of the servicing transfers that we did. Conversely we've got a couple items related to a servicing adjustment that's going through there this quarter. Think of that loan yield at around 4% is probably the right level.","On the margin side it's a lot of that's related to activity. Some of our larger balance customers will move in and out of the market. They have a bit lower of a rate. This quarter we saw a little bit of that sort of activity shift, as lower rate customers moved down and customers at higher rates remained in the balance pool. It's probably best to think about that flat to maybe slightly down.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then, Paul, just on the capital return priorities that you mentioned, of course you mentioned dividends. I mean what is your \u2013 if you were to I guess just outline the importance of either establishing a regular dividend, how important is that to you generally?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's less and less important to us right now, Brian, as opposed to really being careful and thoughtful with our capital deployment. And so I think that would be a lower priority than the other methods of returning capital to shareholders that we've discussed.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then on just on the buyback potential, just the immediacy of that, is that something that can possibly happen as early as fourth quarter? Or are we thinking more of a 2016 and beyond type of event?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm certainly not going to even speculate when we might do something we've just talked about.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. I thought I'd give it a try. That's it from me. Thanks very much.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon, guys.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Patrick.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So a question on Navtej leaving. Does that imply any change in strategy at the company? Or is it just simply a function of basically his job is done, he did what he set out to do, and now you need to flatten out the structure?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's really the latter. And we wouldn't be in position to be driving some of the things we've been driving over the past two years without his support and leadership so. But it's the latter. It's time to flatten out that organization.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. Got it. Thank you. And then a follow-up from me, as we look at your net new brokerage assets year-to-date, it's trailing last year's pace. And when we look at your net new clients, and that's trailing last year's pace too. And granted there's some noise in some of those numbers. But what do you think you guys can do to really reinvigorate the growth of the brokerage franchise, and to reaccelerate the growth of those net new assets in particular?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Patrick, we've been really focusing on getting our self in position to be adding some of the digital capabilities which you've seen just been adding this year, and some of the things I talked about in the prepared remarks. I think stay tuned. We've got some pretty exciting things going to be rolled out that took us a while to get ready to do.","But we're digitally centric. That's the strategy which we are focused on. And so what we're aiming to do is just continue to create a superior online experience for our customers, backed up by absolutely superb customer support, because customers do need that on occasion, and that's the approach we're going to take.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Thank you very much.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you. Heck of a fourth quarter last Saturday huh, Patrick?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Joel Jeffrey with KBW. Please go ahead.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hey, good evening, guys. Just a quick follow-up on the margin balances. It sounds like what you were saying is that you had some more active traders kind of pulling back their activity in that in the third quarter. And since you've commented that it looks like balances have declined further, I'm just wondering if it's the same group of traders that you're seeing pull back, or is this kind of spread towards more of your average trader base as well?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's probably more around the average. Look, margin activity moves throughout the quarter. So it's tough to generalize at this point in terms of what we're going to see. As we move through the fourth quarter, we'll see various activities and movement. So it's tough for me to really say. But at this point, think of it more towards the average.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So I want to thank all of you for taking out the time this evening to spend with us.

No other recordings or copies of this call are authorized or may be relied upon.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Idzik.","Paul Thomas Idzik","Thank you, Jasmine. Good evening. Thank you for joining us. 12 months ago, almost to the day, I joined E*TRADE as the company's CEO and member of the Board of Directors. It's been quite an eventful year and one of tremendous progress for the company.","To summarize a few of the highlights, we made good progress on our capital plan, resulting in regulatory approval of 2 consecutive quarterly dividends after 8 quarters of hiatus; installed a highly experienced new management team, bringing fresh ideas and a more rigorous operating mindset; decided to exit our noncore market-making business; enhanced in a significant manner our enterprise risk management framework; and delivered an unambiguous commitment to our E*TRADE colleagues, board and owners to refocus our efforts on our core business.","In addition, the improving operating environment put some wind in our sails, as DARTs were at a 2-year high; margin loan balances were a 5-year high. We maintained solid growth in accounts and assets, including our managed accounts, which ended the year at an impressive $2.4 billion. Our risk profile also continued to improve, with our legacy loan portfolio down 19% from a year ago and charge-offs and provisions at multiyear lows. We posted earnings of $0.20 for the quarter and $0.70 for the year, excluding the impact of our decision to sell G1X.","When I arrived here, I found an incredibly resilient brokerage franchise and a brand punching above its weight class. I also found a set of colleagues that were very much in need of renewed leadership and a clearer articulation of our purpose and customer focus across the entire organization. With sharper focus, we spent the latter part of 2013 setting ourselves up for growth. We assessed the organization for strength and areas for improvement. Beyond the changes to the executive suite, we made some important appointments within the business and supplemented the existing team with outside talent, including bringing on new leadership in our Corporate Services business and a new head of customer service and branches.","The shift in mindset is also manifested in changes to how we approach investments and our overall cost base. During 2013, the team completed some heavy lifting on the cost-reduction front, whereby a $110 million in gross expenses were eliminated from our controllable, recurring expense base. This exercise did more than position us for an improved bottom line; it forced the company to critically examine its cost structure, positioning us for continued growth in the business and creating capacity for investments in the proper areas when the time is right.","As I mentioned in my opening remarks, 2013 was a tremendous year, not just because the improving environment fueled solid results, but because of actions that we took to enhance the franchise and prepare for its future. Now with the vast majority of our legacy issues squarely in the rearview mirror, or quickly diminishing in terms of relative concern, we find ourselves able to focus more acutely on the core business and what needs to be done to grow purposefully. With much consideration, we decided that the time is right for us to turn up the level of investment in the core business. We're excited about the road ahead of us. And with the engine running more smoothly, predominantly resulting from actions taken by our pit crew over the last year, we feel good about starting to put our foot on the gas after years of covering the brake pedal.","Now, metaphors aside, we are directing our investment dollars towards the following: First, we are focused on making foundational enhancements. While the company has done a great job of balancing legacy risk management and its associated costs with investing in our business, we should no longer have to make this unfortunate trade-off. We are turning our focus and dollars to making our already robust foundation best-in-class.","Second, our colleagues have shown a tremendous amount of resilience and grit over the past several years, in many cases, operating without optimal tools and resources. Our recent positive momentum has allowed us to focus on building out our talent and resources while being fair and competitive in compensating our colleagues. A best-in-class business starts with best-in-class talent.","Third, in an improved operating environment, we can achieve a higher marginal return on our investment and marketing dollars. This is the same rationale that drove our cost cutting activities when the environment was less than attractive. Accordingly, we are moderately investing to expand our brand with our customers. This is an area where we remain nimble in our level of spend, dynamically adjusting for changes in the operating environment.","Finally, with refined focus, we are directing our efforts to enhancing the digital experience of our customers when they're online, while at the same time, delivering a more seamless and synchronized off-line experience through our network of dedicated financial consultants and customer service professionals.","With that as context, we have a number of initiatives we are looking at for 2014, environment permitting, as well as several already underway. These are beginning to be reflected in our Q4 results. Matthew will provide you with more details. But I would lastly note that we obviously maintain the flexibility to dial back our expenses should the environment require it. Frankly, I'm excited that the customer is in a place to be investing in 2014, and I'm looking forward to the company doing so, following on movements with our customers. I'm looking forward to working with the team to further position E*TRADE for growth in 2014 and beyond.","Moving on to our results for the fourth quarter and all of 2013, we posted fourth quarter earnings of $0.20 per share, driven by positive trends in retail engagement and continued reduction of cost related to our legacy risks. DARTs of 160,000 for the quarter were the highest level in over 2 years and has continued their impressive trajectory through January, currently averaging approximately 190,000, up over 20% from December.","Options continue to be an important component of our trades at roughly 1\/4 of the total. And our customers were increasingly engaged with us via mobile, with 9% of total trades executed through our award-winning E*TRADE mobile application.","Further evidence of customer engagement is seen in our 5-year high, margin loan balances. Our average balance were $6.4 billion, up 8% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. Our net new brokerage assets for the quarter of $3.2 billion represented an annualized growth rate of 6.4%. For the year, our net new assets were a record $10.4 billion, modestly above last year's level.","We also brought on 95,000 net new brokerage accounts for the full year, including 22,000 in Q4. Annual attrition was at a record low 8.8% in 2013 and was at 8.9% in Q4.","Our customer metrics on the whole were incredibly positive in 2013. Within these numbers, what I'm especially pleased with is that privates remain in our retirement investing and savings area. This is a critically important focus for us, as we work to do more for our customers and earn more of their business. It also diversifies and provides for a steadier revenue stream. In this regard, we've made some good progress during the fourth quarter. We brought in $1 billion in retirement assets, representing a 10% annualized growth rate and ending the year with $43 billion. We attracted 5,000 net new retirement accounts, ending the year with 826,000. And managed accounts ended the year at $2.4 billion, representing annual growth of approximately 85%. All are very solid proof of our early successes in expanding this key area of our business.","Turning to an update on our leadership team. As of the first of this year, Michael Pizzi, an E*TRADE veteran, took over as our Chief Risk Officer, following Paul Brandow's decision to retire and move into a role as the senior adviser to the company. Michael has been with the company for more than a decade and was most recently our Bank and Corporate Treasurer. He is widely regarded as one of the company's brightest minds, and I am delighted to have him on the executive team. Managing risk is an integral part of a treasurer's role, providing Mike with a great foundation for his new role as Chief Risk Officer. He leaves the Treasury Department in great shape, having built out a talented group of individuals.","Understanding managing and controlling our risks is paramount to the success of this company, and we've worked hard under Paul Brandow's aegis to integrate risk management into our culture. I am confident these efforts will continue on Mike's watch.","We are fortunate that Paul Brandow has graciously agreed to act as an adviser to the company. Paul is an invaluable resource with a wealth of industry knowledge and ever staged counsel and expertise. As a shareholder, I am particularly pleased that Paul has remained involved with the company.","In closing, I couldn't be more proud of the team in the way we executed on my first 366 days on the job. These are exciting times at E*TRADE. I am very pleased to be here working with an exceptional set of colleagues. We have much in store for 2014, and I look forward to sharing more with you throughout the year.","And with that, I will turn the call over to our implacable CFO, Matthew Audette.","Matthew J. Audette","Implacable. Very nice. Thank you, Paul. I certainly echo your sentiment with respect to the changing tide here internally. While we continue to benefit from the favorable migration of our balance sheet and the corresponding reduction of risk, the last year has been a welcome shift towards exhibiting true progress on our capital plans and benefiting from improvements in the operating environment.","As for our results. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $58 million or $0.20 per share, an improvement from net income of $47 million or $0.16 per share in the prior quarter. And also an improvement from the year-ago quarter where we posted a net loss of $186 million or $0.65 per share, which included a $257 million charge related to our $1.3 billion debt refinance.","For the year, we reported net income of $86 million or $0.29 per share. Excluding the impact of our decision to exit the market-making business, our full year net income was $204 million or $0.70 per share. Our fourth quarter net revenues were $447 million, up from $417 million in prior quarter and down from $468 million in the year-ago quarter, which included deleveraging related to gains. Revenues included net interest income of $257 million, up $16 million quarter-over-quarter, as Q4 net interest spread improved to 10 basis points sequentially, while our average balance sheet grew by $900 million.","Fourth quarter spread of 240 basis points brought our full year spread to 233 basis points, down just 6 basis points from 2012's average. For full year 2014, our expectation is for spread to remain in the mid-230s. There are, of course, a number of factors that could impact our actual results. But this is our best assumption based on the current shape of the forward curve and our expectations for balance sheet size, which with our deleveraging complete, will grow naturally with customer cash. Growth, which obviously improves net interest income, but can have a dilutive impact to spread.","Commissions, fees and service charges, principal transactions and other revenue in the fourth quarter were $178 million, up 9% from the prior quarter and up 18% from the same quarter of 2012. Average commission per trade of $10.97 was down $0.18 from the prior quarter and $0.13 from the year-ago period. The sequential decrease, related to a lower portion of Stock Plan trades. For the full year, average commission per trade was $11.13, an improvement of $0.12 from 2012, primarily attributable to higher Stock Plan trades. Principal transactions revenue increased $4 million from Q3, as revenue capture improved significantly.","A quick reminder, upon the closing on the sale of our market-making unit, the principal transactions line will be going away, as it relates solely to this business. Our fees and service charges revenue will then benefit from increased payment for it as well, as 100% of our order flow will be routed to third parties.","We've been working diligently to prepare for the closing of sale of this business. While there is still more work to be done and regulatory approvals to obtain, we feel good about getting the transaction closed by the end of Q1. Revenue this quarter also included $12 million of net gains in loans and securities, in line with our previously communicated expectations. We continue to expect this line to decline in 2014 if interest rates fall before the curve and increase.","Our operating expenses for the full year, excluding goodwill impairment, were $1.1 billion, a decrease of $29 million or 3% from 2012. For the quarter, our expenses were $295 million, an increase of 9% from the prior quarter and 3% from the year-ago quarter. As Paul mentioned, we have begun investing more in the business, and that is included to a certain extent in our Q4 numbers.","In addition to those investments, the quarter included $5 million of restructuring costs and approximately $10 million in other operating expenses that I would categorize as cleanup items, including write-offs of internally developed software that we decided not to continue and an estimated penalty related to the escheatment of customers assets.","While the cleanup costs I just mentioned are likely nonrecurring in nature, we do plan to continue to invest in the business. Accordingly, we currently expect our 2014 quarterly run rate for operating expenses to fall within a range of $270 million to $280 million, keeping in mind that Q1 will likely be above that range due to seasonality, as well as the inclusion of G1X's operating expenses prior to the closing of the sale. It is important to note that unlike our cost cutting, which had a very specific scope, our investment plans for 2014 will be dynamic, as opportunities are solidified or as the environment demands.","So while this is our expected range of expenses today, we will be critically reviewing our spending plans each quarter. As far as where the investments will occur, the majority will be in headcount, so compensation and professional services. We'll also be spending a bit more in marketing, where we expect to be up approximately 10% versus 2013 for the full year.","As Paul mentioned, in the current environments, the returns of marketing dollars are much more attractive, and we are going to take advantage of that. And while we've set aside a certain amount of money to do so, not all of that has been committed. We'll be mindful of the environment as we proceed and maintain the ability to dial back some of these investments should conditions warrant. But I can tell you that it feels good to be talking about investing in the business after focusing on cost cutting for so long.","Turning to our loan portfolio. This quarter's provision for loan losses was $17 million compared with $37 million the prior quarter. Home prices exhibited exceptionally strong performance during the quarter, improving 6% across our portfolio and driving charge-offs and provision below our expected range. To provide some perspective, at the end of 2012 we expected home price depreciation of 2% throughout the full year 2013. Home prices greatly outperformed expectations, growing approximately 25% through 2013. This dramatic improvement in home prices was a significant driver of the decline in provisioning charge-offs in 2013. Home price appreciation also drove down average CLTVs, which are now below 100% for both our first mortgage and home equity portfolios.","For 2014, our current expectation is for quarterly provision to be within the range of $15 million to $35 million, which includes a 6% expected improvement in home prices and our current expectations on the performance of our portfolio, as the home equity conversions enter our forecast period.","The total portfolio contracted approximately $450 million this quarter, driven by paydowns of $425 million. The portfolio's 19% decline in 2013 is consistent with each of the past 5 years where the book has come down by 18% to 20%. We expect this will continue in 2014, placing quarterly runoff at around $400 million over the next quarter or 2, declining towards $350 million by year end.","Our loan portfolio ended the quarter at $8.6 billion, and our allowance ended the quarter at $453 million, decreasing $6 million from the prior quarter. While the portfolio balance continues to decline and the relative performance in quality continue to demonstrate improvement, we are mindful of future conversions in the home equity portfolio. Currently, there are $0.7 of these loans set to convert in 2015 and another $1.1 billion in 2016. We keep a close watch on this population and intend to be aggressive in mitigating losses should their performance deteriorate, with modification as a potential tool in this regard.","I would also remind you that our borrowers continue to make principal payments ahead of schedule, as approximately 40% of borrowers in their draw period made voluntary principal reductions of at least $500 during 2013. And just under half of those made voluntarily principal payments of at least $2,500, with a relatively small average loan size of $74,000. These numbers are meaningful.","As our total portfolio is now down 74% from its peak size, I would like to make mention that going forward, we will no longer report loan performance data in our monthly activity reports. With the diminishing size of the portfolio, the intra-quarter numbers are no longer as meaningful to our financial performance as they once were.","Moving to our capital plan. We have come a long way in the 18 months since our original submission in June of 2012. And I am incredibly proud of what we have accomplished in such a short period of time. We entered 2013 with some positive momentum after completing a refinance of our highest cost corporate debt. From there, we completed our main progress on all elements of our capital plan. To recap, we completed over $8.7 billion of deleveraging actions through sweep deposit transfers, directing cash to money funds and reduction of wholesale funding. We completed a rigorous review of our expense base and eliminated $110 million in gross operating expenses, positioning us well for growth, environment permitting.","We continue to build out our enterprise risk management capabilities, making important progress towards the heightened regulatory expectations. We achieved our target Tier 1 leverage ratio with the bank through our combination of earnings generation and deleveraging. And finally, we rounded out 2013 with 2 consecutive quarterly dividends from the bank to the parent, totaling $175 million. I'm impressed at what the team have accomplished here. The dividends we received are crucial milestones in our efforts to achieve a more efficient capital structure. As we move into the New Year, we are focused on continuing to meet the objectives laid out in our capital plan.","Over the near term, we intend to continue requesting quarterly dividends up to the level of the bank's net income for the prior quarter. Over the long term, our plans remain to request capital in excess of the bank's Tier 1 leverage ratio threshold outlined in the plan.","The next critical step for us in determining how our request for dividends will be shaped will be the upcoming stress testing, required for submission at the end of March. While we have been running substantially similar tests internally for some time now and sharing the results with our regulators, these formal submission should play an important role in assessing our capital strength, hopefully resulting in more clarity on our long-term dividend plans.","We ended the quarter with $450 million in corporate cash, approximately $200 million above our target of 2 years of debt service coverage. Continued approvals of dividend request would only serve to grow parent cash, as will closing the sale of our market maker, from which we expect approximately $75 million in proceeds to make it to the parent.","As we analyze the best usage for this capital, we are mindful that both our regulators and board will be involved in the decision making process. At this point, we are still focused on reducing parent debt as a likely first use of this cash. As for our capital ratios, we feel good about our position as improved across most measures of both the bank and parent. Our bank's Tier 1 leverage ratio ended the quarter at our targeted 9.5%, with approximately $165 million of capital generation, funding a $75 million dividend and balance sheet growth of $700 million. We also remain well-positioned under the new Basel III capital rules, which would significantly improve our risk-based capital ratios across the board.","To sum it all up, 2013 was a banner year for E*TRADE. An Improving operating environment and increasing customer engagement helped to produce solid financial results. Our business continue to demonstrate its strength, as we reach all-time highs in several key customer metrics. And finally, we have truly turned the corner with respect to the financial position of the company. It has been a long and trying road, and the lessons learned are ever present in each step we take today. And while there is still plenty of work to do, I am pleased with where we are as we begin 2014.","And with that, operator, we'll open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","My first question is on the expenses. So I get the investment -- the plan to invest in 2014. I'm just trying to see what is the amount -- if we're looking at a mid-260s prior, we'll look at mid-270 per quarter now. Is it a $40 million sort of planned investment? And then the other part would be, what's the revenue expectations tied to this $40 million in expense investment?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes, Rich. It's Mr. Implacable here. So a couple of spaces. So in the prepared remarks, I kind of focused on the investments going forward are going to be on people, right? The areas, I think, Paul covered pretty well, making foundational enhancements, focusing in on our talent, increasing the marketing dollars a bit and then focusing on our customers\u2019 online experience. But the amount, I think you got it right, going from a mid-260s run rate to the 270, 280. That's about $10 million a quarter, $40 million a year. I think that's a good way to think about it. I think the returns are on the growth and the value of the business overall. I think this is not the type of spending where each and every single dollar has a project or has an individual ROI. I think we're looking at the overall franchise. I think now is time for us to, as Paul said, put our foot on the gas a bit here and make some very focused and prudent investments. I'd be remiss to say if I didn't make the points that I made in the prepared remarks, that we are very focused on shareholder money and shareholder dollars, making sure that we're spending it wisely. So we're going to look at this in a very deliberate way. We're going to look at the environment we're in. We're going to be looking at the projects that we're working on. But I think everything we said today is what we view right now. Now is the time to turn the investments up.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Got it, and one follow-up, it would be on the provision. So the guidance is 15 to 35. The build for the home equity, the build on the home equity allowance dropped materially. And I think we're all understanding that your modeling is a little bit more complex than the real estate prices, et cetera. But can you give -- if the provision stayed in that range, how much are you planning to build the home equity allowance in front of the amortization that's coming in 2015 and '16?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes, Rich. I think the trends that we've seen in the individual buckets are the One- to Four- versus home equity over the last several quarters. You're going to see that trend continue, which is that the home equity is the one that's building and the One- to Four- that's coming down. I think the quarterly volatility, just looking at the recent past, right? If you look at the past few quarters, those are the quarters where we really -- where we're building the reserves for the balloon loans, right? Within the home equity book, we've got a subset there. They don't actually convert to amortized in the -- they are balloon loans, so they mature. It's a relatively small portfolio, under $250 million, but we fully reserve for the estimated license -- losses over the life of that portfolio. So I think that was driving a bit of the large build that you saw on the past few quarters. So that you're still going to have lumpiness like that depending on the amounts that are entering in our forecast period, going forward. But I think at least, the balloons kind of explained the large builds in the past few quarters prior to this one.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First, I guess, on -- Matt, on capital. Can you walk through, I guess, dynamic that it looks like if credit continues to get better, provisional looks a little bit lower? You guys will probably build a little bit more capital at the bank than we've seen in the past, and you're paying out less than you're generating. So to the extent where Tier 1 leverage actually builds over the few quarters at the bank, is there anything else you could do with respect to bringing back the deposits a bit sooner? I think you guys have $8 billion or $9 billion of balance sheet as of the last filing.","Matthew J. Audette","Yes, hang on. So I think the -- our view on capital is really -- hasn't really changed. Over the near-term we're focused on up to the bank earnings in the prior quarter, over the long term, bringing that leverage ratio down from the 9.5% to 8%. And that long term could be, and likely at some point, would be bringing deposits back on balance sheet. But where we are today, I think that we're really focused on the stress test. It's really the primary next step here and getting comfort with our capital adequacy, right? That's not too far off, right? These are due at the end of this quarter. We would likely be in a position to have active constructive dialogue on that in the second quarter and be in a position to be, I think, better informed at the end of the second quarter. So I think until then, our views are really just focused on prior-quarter bank earnings.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then just a quick follow-up on the net interest margin in the quarter. How much was premium amortization? Looks like there are a couple of buckets that more of the yields actually came up a little bit. I'm assuming that's what really drove that, and maybe you can give us kind of a sense of what the reinvestment yields are today in the securities portfolio.","Matthew J. Audette","Sure. So the increase in the quarter was primarily driven by the security books, specifically a slowdown in prepayments. The vast -- you can see that in the 2 lines, the available for sale securities and in the held-to-maturity securities. Those securities are brought on the books, mostly at premium. So when you have prepayments, that's going to impact your spread. When those prepayments slow down, it's going to improve it nicely. The prepayments in Q4 were at quite historic low levels for us, even though there's really little incentive to refinance, especially if rates are going up in the future. There is a base level of refinance rate. Whether people are buying new houses or getting new jobs and moving to different cities, we would expect a little bit of an increase in the prepayment next year. So you get a little bit of a headwind pushing that spread down from 240. The reinvestment rates have improved a little bit. They're in that, say, in the 175 to 200 range. But with a growing balance sheet, that 175 to 200, well, it's going to help net interest income. As I said in the prepared remarks it will be a little bit diluted to spread. But I think all those things come together to bias net interest income up in 2014 versus '13.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak of Nomura.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Concerning the redemption of high-cost corporate debt, how should we think about the minimum level of cumulative pretax income generation required at the bank to ensure that you can generate sufficient capital to redeem the first 2 tranches under the current cost schedule?","Matthew J. Audette","Well, so the first time that we can call anything is the 6% notes of $500 million at the end of this year, right? So if you just look at -- not that we can predict the future, but if you just assume that the $75 million dividends continue on a quarterly basis, and we close the sale of G1X, which is also $75 million. You'd be reasonably in a position to call those at the end of the year, but I think we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves here. We've got a lot of good momentum. We've been doing a lot of good things that, I think, have led to the 2 dividends that we've received to date. So our focus is just on keeping on doing those things. And as we get towards the end of the year for -- if we're in a good enough position to be able to do something there, of course, we'll be talking to you about it.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And actually as a follow-up to that, you know that the dividends thus far reflect earnings generation at the bank exclusively and, thus, does not appear to include any additional benefit relating to the consumption of disallowed DTA at the bank. I didn't know how we should be thinking about the timing, size or even mechanics for upstreaming higher levels of capital, which reflects the benefit of both levers i.e., the bank earnings as well as future DTA utilization.","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. So we're definitely -- the capital generated, is certainly more than the earnings after-tax earnings with the bank, to your point on deferred tax asset. I think our view is that's how -- that's what we're focused on the near-term. Longer-term, obviously, we'd be moving more capital above that if we going to move the leverage ratio down to that 8%. But I think that our near-term focus is really on the stress test, right? There's really -- that's the main thing to get comfortable, both ourselves, our regulators and any other constituency involved with the capital sufficiency. So a long way of saying, I think, we'll be in a much better position at the end of the second quarter to have a view on that.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. It's very helpful. And then last one for me. Some of your competitors have actually provided NIM guidance based on the current trajectory of the Fed Funds futures curve. And based of the current curve, I don't know if you can give us a sense of what level of NIM improvement we can reasonably expect beyond 2014. So in '15 and '16?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. So -- we -- you can guess that we plan and manage to that. But no, I don't have anything for you beyond 2014, which should be in the mid-230s.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Joel Jeffrey of KBW.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just some of your peers have commented that they've seen some improvements in margin balances into January. Just wondering if you could comment if you've seen similar trends since year end?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. So when we didn't provide an update on January margin. I mean, margin on a daily basis is something that can move around pretty substantially with customer buying and selling activities. I think we get focused more on the months and the quarters. And today, we covered in the prepared remarks, we're at a 5-year high into March right here. It keeps trucking up from $6 billion a couple of quarters ago and ending this year at $6.4 billion. So we feel good about the margin growth, but not getting too hung-up in the short term in January so far.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just as a quick follow-up to that, was the decline in the yield on that due just to mix shift? Or was there anything else going on there?","Matthew J. Audette","It was. It was. I mean, the growth we had was on the higher balances, which get the lower rates. So just the mix.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, for me. The tax rate came in a little bit higher than what we were looking forward. Is this sort of a onetime thing? Or is this -- is there a different way we should be thinking about taxes, going forward.","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. So no different way of thinking about it. I mean, our effective tax rate should be in the 40% range. Q4 is a notorious quarter for tax, right, because you're truing up all your estimates that you made in the first 3 quarters to get to your overall effective rate for the year. If -- exclusive of the impact of the decision to sell G1X, our effective rate for the year was around 40%. You just had a bunch of true-ups in the fourth quarter. And that's our expectation for next year as well, around 40%.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So first question on retail re-engagements. You guys are posting really great trading numbers along with everybody else. And I guess, what I'm trying to figure out, if we look at your activity rates today and compare them maybe back to pre-recession peaks, it seems like you and others are kind of already back up to that level. So I guess, what I'm wondering -- do you think this cycle we could see higher highs and activity levels, given you have other things going on, like growth in mobile trading or growth in derivatives? Or do you think that we're kind of getting to the upper band of how much higher activity levels can go?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes, Chris. So we're definitely not clairvoyant on that. But I think that just looking at the month -- of what we've seen so far in January. The month is not over yet, but 3 weeks into it. We're at 190,000, right? Those are levels that we have not seen in a very long time, especially versus the 160,000 in Q4. So we see some increased activity. If you would have asked me in December, what -- would have I thought January would be at 190,000? There is no way I would've thought that. So things are definitely picking up. But knowing anything beyond that, it's just -- it's hard to tell.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But -- I mean, you assume that mobile trading and derivatives and all the rest is having a pretty big impact in some of the uptick you're seeing? I mean, we just didn't have that back in '06 and '07. I'm just wondering if that's playing a pretty big factor in kind of the acceleration?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. I mean, we're getting more of our trades through mobile, right? We're getting around 9%, which has been a bigger increase, obviously, versus many, many years ago where it was 0. It's hard to know if that increases in trading versus it's just a better way for customers to access us, a better way for customers to be engaged with us. It's hard to tell if that's incremental trades or not. I think as the broad point is, as our platform improves and all of our digital experience improves, I think that only is a tailwind versus for customer growth and customer activity going forward. But it's just hard to tell if that's an exact cause in the short term.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. A second question that relates to the loan portfolio. Being so sensitive to home values, and you guys are assuming a rise of 6% in '14. Can you give us some sense as to the sensitivity on how that outlook could change if home values changed? So in other words, if you get maybe up 12% as opposed to up 6%, what that might do to your provision estimate?","Matthew J. Audette","Well, I don't have that level of precision. I think it's a pretty fair assumption that we came up with a range and highlighted home prices and the home equity transition as the 2 things that are included in there. We did that for a reason. But I don't have a precise breakout for you in exactly how those 2 impact it.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Chris Allen with Evercore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just wondering if you could provide some additional detail in terms of some of the foundational enhancements in investment spend, whether that's investing in areas such as customer service, trading technology, product development, or whether it's just a fairly broad-based?","Paul Thomas Idzik","Let me -- thank you for your question. Let me just answer where we're directing the investment and, along the way with that, point out some foundational issues. The first place we're investing is to improve the customer experience, whether that's products and services, better skills and staffing in the customer service areas, adding financial consultants in the branches, et cetera. That's one area of investment. The second is on regulatory matters where -- that's an industry-wide issue in financial services of rising expectations from a number of regulators for better performance and better demonstrability of performance regarding regulatory matters. The third is really volume related. And in there, you'll have some foundational elements, as we try and make sure we're running a safe and secure highway, but also making sure that we're able to handle the higher levels of customer engagement and higher level of customer activities, which we're seeing, and as you can see, compare favorably across the industry over the last quarter. And then the fourth is in marketing as we seek to expand what we offer our existing customers, making sure we tell them about it, as well as attracting new customers, and reaching those customers and prospects in a more sophisticated, analytical way than we've done in the past. So you see that fall in 4 categories, but in terms of the foundational elements I'd point, I point particularly to the third, which is responding to volume increases and also ensuring that we're running a safe and secure network and platform for our customers to trade with confidence.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just on the net interest income. The only thing about the outlook, you gave the spread, what your expectation is. Just in terms of the growth, the balance sheet, I guess, we look at the new money that's coming in, either from the clients. Either should we assume a fairly consistent growth rate in the balances throughout 2014? Or either should we expect any change there relative to what's coming in?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes, Mike. I mean, that's hard to predict, right? So the customer flow is coming in. The net new assets is a little bit more of a steady number. But customer activity is also a big driver, right? So net buying and selling can impact in a pretty meaningful way the amount of cash that's coming through. So it's hard to predict. I mean, if you just look at the couple of quarters, right, the balance sheet is growing in the $500 million to $700 million range per quarter. We got a lot of cash off-balance-sheet, so to extent that those balances grow obviously that doesn't impact cash. On-balance-sheet cash or balance sheet size. So it's hard to tell. Again, the best thing I could point you to is just looking at the past few quarters as a guide.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, in terms of the new investments you gave some color there. I guess, just 2 things. I just want to make sure we got it right. If I look at last quarter, I think your run rate was like around $265 million, and I think that includes like the G1X. So if we expect that to be stepping down, but still expect like a $270 million to $280 million run rate, just want to make sure that we have that, right? I know you said the first quarter would be elevated because G1X would still be in there. But I just want to make sure we're understanding it right. And then in terms of investments and what the payoff is, all the areas that you mentioned in terms of customer service, that makes sense. I guess, I'm just wondering, when you think about whether it's account growth, DARTs, net new assets, in terms of the drivers of revenues, what are your expectations? Or if you look 12 months in the future, where would things be to, say, okay those investments were successful?","Matthew J. Audette","So mike, on the G1X point, that's correct. So G1X as -- I was highlighting what was in there, likely going to be above that range in the first quarter because of seasonality in G1X. So that $270 million to $280 million range assumes that the G1X costs are gone. I think on the returns, I mean, I would just reiterate what I had said earlier, right? We're not -- we're very mindful on spending the dollars, shareholders' money on these investments. This is just not the type of stuff where you can measure it with an individual investment, ROI, right? We're investing -- as Paul just highlighted in pretty good detail, we're investing in a lot of foundational and franchise items. So I think the proof points are just in the franchise growing over the long term. So it's just -- it's hard -- it's not something where you can pinpoint metrics in the short term.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the next question comes from the line of Kenneth Hill.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to have a follow-up on DARTs here, real quick. I think you guys said the volume from options was around 25% for the quarter. Just wondered how that compared to past quarters. And maybe where your outlook is for the mix of derivatives, overall, going forward? And maybe what kind of actions might kind of move that higher over time, whether it's more advertising or adding technology or functionality for customers?","Paul Thomas Idzik","It's been fairly consistent over the past several quarters at about 1\/4 of our volume, particularly, in what's going to happen in the future is much more difficult as investors take different positions and different sentiments on the economy. We will certainly be putting in the hands of our customers better tools and providing them enhanced education. So that when they do decide to engage with us in these type trades, they can do so with more confidence and a better perspective on their overall financial health. So whether that leads to more or less in terms of the mix, that's not what drives our daily activity in trying to provide the best experience for our customers.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. Another thing from when we talked with you was probably then, close to when you started about a year ago, you talked about -- you had a lot of the data at the company right now, it was more about listening to the customers and harnessing kind of what's already available. It seems like you're charting the next phase of that as far as investing in the platforms again. Just kind of wondering if you still think you've gotten to a good point where you understand what the customers want. Is that going to be more about developing internally? Or is that going to be purchasing some of that additional capacity, I guess, going forward.","Paul Thomas Idzik","I think what's important is that listening to our customers is a bit of a never-ending game because what they want and they're interested in changes as a result of their own personal circumstances and what happens to the economy. A lot of what we're going to do is really aimed at internally using that data and using it every day in what we do. Certainly, we'll be bringing in some outside tools that have already been developed because there's no reason to redevelop those things that we could buy off-the-shelf. We want to be responsible with that investment, but a lot of it will be adding tools and skills to people who are already working at E*TRADE. And making those available to engage better with the customers as well as driving more inside as we think about product development and our education resources. But I'd say the majority of our mix there will be internal, internal resources, not external.","Operator","And we have a question coming from the line of Devin Ryan of JMP Securities.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been already answered. But I just want to follow up on your interest rate sensitivity and kind of -- maybe dig in a little bit on your long-term outlook for net interest income and the eventual impact of rising rates. I guess, my question is really: Once the balance sheet has been fully transformed, how are you guys thinking about the liability side of the equation in that 300-basis-point net interest -- spread level that you've disclosed once rates normalize? I know a lot of companies have really given differing views around how much of the benefit they think they'll be able to retain versus have to pass along to customers. So I would be interested then to hear your thoughts on that matter.","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. Sure, Devin. So our balance sheet is liability driven. So I think, over the long term in a more normalized rate environment where we expect to earn a spread of 300 basis points, it is a customer and deposit driven balance sheet. Meaning, the wholesale funding book has run off other than some short-term liquidity needs. And you've got deposits and customer payables funding the balance sheet. I think when you look at the price sensitivity of that cash, which, I think, is probably -- sounds like the core of your question, we've been through a lot of rate cycles with this cash, right? And I think that at its very core, folks don't have cash with us because they're seeking a higher rate. They have cash with us because they're looking to invest in it. So it's really not a rate product. It's a convenience product to be ready to invest in the market as the customer so chooses or so decides. So I think we feel confident in the pricing in a more normalized environment that underlies our assumption that we would achieve a spread of 300 basis points. So that's our view there.","Operator","And Mr. Idzik, there are no further questions over the phone lines at this time. I will now turn the call back over to you for any closing remarks or to continue with the presentation.","Paul Thomas Idzik","I'd just like to thank all of you for calling in and hope you have a good evening.

No other recordings or copies of this call are authorized or may be relied upon.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul Idzik.","Paul Thomas Idzik","Thank you very much. Good evening. It's a pleasure to be speaking with you again. There's plenty on which to update you since we last spoke so I'll get right into it. I joined E*TRADE a little over 6 months ago, and I faced each day with more enthusiasm for this company and the opportunities that lie ahead of us. As you are aware, the last few years have been quite challenging not only for our industry, but particularly for this company. My colleagues here have put in a lot of hard work through these times, toughed it out and we are now ready to drive the franchise forward. We now sit in a position where, through proper focus on execution, we can crisply turn the corner and deliver for our customers and our owners in a meaningful way. I have the senior team focused on a number of key areas to help our company and help our company seize the opportunities that lie ahead of us. First, the ruthless execution of our capital plan about which we have been speaking for quite some time. Successful execution of this plan is the most visible, meaningful and measurable way to deliver near-term value to our shareholders, and we've made significant progress in a number of key elements within the plan, including de-risking and deleveraging the balance sheet, building out our enterprise risk management capabilities, particularly internal audit, bank compliance and operational risk management. Reducing our costs, have completed damn near all of our identified cost saves. And finally, bolstering our capital position, reaching our target for the bank's Tier 1 leverage ratio during Q2.","We remain intensely focused on execution of this plan and are increasingly confident in our ability to achieve our capital goals going forward.","Our second area of focus, that's something of particular interest of mine, is to ensure that this business receives the level of attention and leadership it deserves. In that regard, I have completed the buildout of my executive committee, adding some serious fire power this quarter. First, with the appointment of Navtej Nandra as the company's President. Mr. Nandra has taken the range on reshaping some of our internal structures to better align our colleagues with their talents and our business goals. Further, he is ensuring that our day-to-day business activities advance the ball in improving our customer experience and reshaping the P&L. With the good fortune of a great depth of talent here at E*TRADE, and Navtej's incisive way of thinking, I believe we are well positioned to succeed.","We also have recently brought on a new Chief Marketing Officer in Liza Landsman, who joined us following impactful 10 years at Citigroup and BlackRock. She has wasted no time since her arrival completing a thorough review of marketing indices and selecting a partner to help us to find our path towards the next phase of this company's evolution. Liza is in the final stages of bringing out Ogilvy & Mather to help us drive a marketing and advertising platform that more fulsomely engages with our existing customers, while emphasizing our brand as a trusted destination for assets and advice to the broader market.","And our third area of focus, driving productivity. Driving productivity and value through constant process improvement and an unwavering focus to deliver for our customers and our owners. While this is fairly comprehensive and embedded within the other areas of attention I described, my goal is to more effectively drive the theme of executional excellence and process perfection across the depth and breadth of this organization. No matter how good processes are, they can always be improved. So this will never cease to be an area of our concentration.","Somewhat in the same vein, I am proud to announce that the team has completed essentially 100% of our targeted cost reductions as outlined in our capital plan. Cutting unnecessary spend and reshaping our cost structure sets us up for significant operating leverage, particularly, if we continue to move into a more healthful macroeconomic environment, marked by improving investor sentiment, more beneficial interest rates and continuing improvement in credit. If these trends continue in the right directions, I hope to be in a position where we're discussing the areas in which we are investing as opposed to providing updates on cost reduction.","Moving on to results in the business. For the second quarter, we posted a net loss of $54 million or $0.19 per share, which included a onetime charge of $142 million related to the impairment of goodwill, resulting from our decision to exit our market-making business. We acquired the market maker in 2001. As my team has looked at where we want to allocate our resources, both financial and management energy, we decided our owners would best be served by exiting this business unit. Matthew is orchestrating the sale of this business and we'll cover more on this topic later in this call. Excluding the impact of our decision to exit the market maker on the quarter's results, we had a respectable Q2, recording net income of $60 million or $0.21 per share on revenues of $440 million. Our results reflected ongoing customer engagement with quarterly DARTs of $150,000, up slightly from the first quarter and up 8% from the second quarter of 2012. We were pleased to see customer activity remain in line with the first quarter, but are mindful that the third quarter is typically slower due to seasonality. So we're not surprised that our July-to-date trading levels are tracking down 4% from June, but pleased they're up from July of last year by 8%.","Derivatives continue to be an important component of how our customers manage their financial well being. Second quarter trading activity included 24% of our customer volume adoptions, a fairly consistent mix for the past year. Mobile transactions continue to trend upwards amongst our customers as approximately 8% of DARTs came from mobile devices during the quarter, a nice improvement over last quarter and more than doubled their levels from 2 years ago.","Net new brokerage assets for the quarter were $1.7 billion, bringing the year-to-date total to $4.8 billion, representing an annualized growth rate of 5.6% behind our 8.5% annualized growth in the first half of 2012. Our comparatively slower asset growth is attributable to seasonal outflows around tax season. In April of this year, our net new brokerage assets were essentially 0, weighing on our full quarter growth metrics. We brought in 30,000 net new brokerage accounts, which is off the pace of 46,000 in the same quarter last year. However, our teams did an exceptional job in retaining existing accounts as we posted 8.4% annualized brokerage account attrition in Q2, matching our record lows set in the same period of last year and delivering our renewed commitment to improving the quality of our customer experience.","An important area of opportunity continues to be created by expanding customer awareness around our retirement, investing and savings offerings. In particular, our managed accounts. Within these product groups, we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion in assets under management, a significant achievement given we launched these products just 3 years ago. We obviously look forward to driving even more meaningful growth in these products to make them a more impactful and visible contributor to our customers' financial well being and to our shareholders' returns.","In summary of the quarter, I'm pleased with our results. The team executed well on a number of our initiatives including sharpening our customer focus, cost reductions and our capital plan. You have heard me talk more about what we, as a team at E*TRADE, are doing about improving what we deliver in support of our customers. You should expect this to increasingly feature in our expositions about the business.","As we have gained tempo regarding the capital plan and have successfully delivered against virtually all of our targeted cost reduction efforts, the team can now sharpen its focus on things that it's well armed to do and to do well: improve the customer experience, deliver exceptional value, increase productivity, drive returns for our shareholders and get back to having some fun. We still have our work cut out for us for the remainder of the year and beyond, but I'm confident in our capabilities and motivation to seize the opportunities that we see ahead of us.","One final note before I turn the microphone over to Matthew. I wanted to take a moment to properly announce and welcome our newest member of E*TRADE's Board of Directors, Mr. Mohsen Fahmi. Mohsen brings a superb record of financial services experience, particularly in the area of risk management. We are fortunate to have him on the team and look forward to his contributions and insight. We are still in the process of searching for other talented individuals to join our board, and we will obviously update when there's more to share in that regard. With that, I will turn the call over to our ever prudent CFO, Matthew Audette.","Matthew J. Audette","Thank you, Mr. Idzik. For the second quarter, we reported a net loss of $54 million or $0.19 loss per share, which includes impairment of goodwill of $142 million, associated with our intent to exit our market making business. Excluding this charge, we reported solid net income of $60 million or $0.21 per share, up from net income of $35 million or $0.12 per share in the first quarter, and up from net income of $40 million or $0.14 per share in the year-ago period.","Our second quarter net revenues were $440 million, up from $420 million in the prior quarter. Revenues included net interest income of $243 million, up slightly quarter-over-quarter as a result of 5 basis points of net interest spread improvement to 235 basis points, partially offset by a $730 million reduction in the average balance sheet size.","The increase in spread this quarter was primarily driven by an improvement in the interest rate environment as we saw rates rise across the curve. Given this rise in rates, we now anticipate our net interest spread for the full year of 2013 to be slightly above 230 basis points. Additionally, if rates move in line with what the forward curve assumes, we anticipate further spread improvement in 2014, with an average spread of approximately 240 basis points.","Commissions, fees and service charges, principal transactions and other revenue in the second quarter were $177 million, up 8% from the prior quarter and up 15% from the same quarter of 2012. Average commission per trade was $11.10, down from $11.30 last quarter due to a lower mix of the Stock Plan trades in Q2. Principal transactions revenue was down slightly quarter-over-quarter despite a slight increase in volatility as spreads tightened and a smaller portion of our customer trades were handled internally.","Revenue in this quarter also included $20 million of net gains on loans of securities net of impairment, up from $15 million in the prior quarter. The significant volatility in rates and mortgage spreads that occurred late in the quarter resulted in the repositioning of portfolio assets, driving gains above our forecasted range. Despite the sequential increase, we continue to expect these gains to be in the $10 million to $15 million range per quarter, barring potential deleveraging needs or volatility in the rate environment.","Our legacy loan portfolio ended the quarter at $9.6 billion, a contraction of approximately $500 million during the quarter and is now down more than 70% from its peak. We expect loan runoff to average approximately $400 million per quarter for the rest of 2013, generally consistent with the 4% to 5% quarterly decline we have experienced for some time.","This quarter's provision for loan losses was $46 million compared with $43 million in the prior quarter, which was positively impacted by a $13 million settlement. So adjusted for last quarter's settlement, this quarter's provision marked a sequential improvement of approximately $10 million.","For the remainder of this year, barring any unforeseen external disruptions, we expect quarterly provision expense to be in the range of $40 million to $60 million. However, I must emphasize the nature of the quarterly provision is inherently uncertain. So this range, while our best estimate today, could vary meaningfully.","Total net charge-offs in the quarter were $50 million, down considerably from last quarter's $81 million, excluding the $13 million settlement. Total special mention delinquencies in the quarter were down 14% sequentially and delinquencies for the entire loan portfolio were at their lowest levels since mid-2007. The total allowance for loan losses ended the quarter at $451 million, down $4 million from last quarter. With delinquencies at their lowest levels in the past 6 years, our coverage for potential losses on non-modified loans increased significantly, and this quarter's allowance represents coverage of 95% of loans at least 90 days past due. This compares to 80% last quarter. For modified loans, our total expected losses remain at 35%, unchanged from Q1. Improvements in the housing market so far this year have had positive impacts on our loan portfolio. The overall risk profile has improved, with the average LTV of our 1 to 4 family portfolio ending the quarter at 98%, down nearly 7 percentage points and below 100% for the first time since 2010. The average CLTVs of our home equity book also saw market improvement, ending the quarter just under 105%, the lowest since 2009.","During the quarter, we modified $35 million of loans, slightly up from $34 million in the prior quarter. We continue to expect modifications to remain at low levels over the near term. However, modifications may increase in future periods as our HELOCs convert from interest-only to amortizing in the years to come. As we've indicated in past presentations, these conversions will not take place in a material way until 2015 and beyond. Of our $3 billion HELOC portfolio, 26% are scheduled to convert in 2015 with an additional 41% in 2016.","Moving on, as we mentioned earlier, we have decided to exit our market making unit, G1X, a conclusion reached in light of the tightening economics for that business, coupled with a potential associated risk, both operational and regulatory, and most importantly, because it is not core to our retail customer business. The sale process is currently underway, and we aim to announce a transaction in the next 3 to 6 months. We will update you once there's more to share. For the moment, I will only highlight that we do not expect a material impact on our future financials once we sell this business, as the majority of its value to the firm lies in our ongoing customer order flow. Said differently, once the sale is complete, all revenue in the principal transactions line will be gone, and the fees and services charge line will reflect payment for order flow as all volume is sent externally. One other impact of our decision to exit the market making business relates to the reclassification of its assets and liabilities to held for sale, which are now captured within other assets and other liabilities. This included the reclassification of approximately $90 million in trading securities and approximately $20 million of intangible assets. Excluding the impairment of goodwill and restructuring, operating expenses for the quarter were $262 million, down sequentially, predominantly on lower advertising, compensation and FDIC premiums. While the sequential decline in advertising and compensation expenses reflected seasonality, the reduction in FDIC insurance premiums relates to the continued improvement in the quality of our balance sheet. We expect this line will continue to improve over time, commensurate with the improvement to our overall risk profile.","On expenses broadly, I am proud to say that we have substantially completed all of the targeted cost savings captured in our $110 million expense reduction plan. As a reminder, when we began the program last year, we set out to drive efficiency across the company by reducing recurring, controllable expenses in areas that were not directly driving value for our owners. We took a hard look at every dollar spent across the organization and made determinations based on overall return and ultimate benefit to our customers. Through this review, we identified and implemented savings across a number of fronts, most notably through our people costs. Since we began the program, our total headcount, including outsource support, is down from a peak of around nearly 4,000 to approximately 3,300 today. With that, we feel good about our cost reductions being complete, and are focused on ensuring we have the right level of investments going forward.","Additionally, as we have dug further into the details of building out our enterprise risk management capabilities, we have determined that we need to make additional investments. As such, our initial investment -- estimate for our investment of ERM of $10 million is now closer to $15 million. This is a crucially important area for us. And given the importance we place on doing this right, we feel good about this additional investment. Accordingly, our estimated net cost reductions are approximately $95 million. And the clean quarterly expense, run rate should wind up in the mid-260s.","Turning to corporate cash. We ended the quarter at $251 million, above 2 years' worth of debt service coverage. The sequential decline of $101 million related to corporate interest payments, as well as other tax payments and intercompany settlements. As a reminder, there can be noise in the individual quarters related to tax and intercompany allocations, which do not necessarily impact the corporate cash in a meaningful way over the long term.","Our capital ratios improved across all measures during the quarter for bank and consolidated calculations. At the bank, our Q1 leverage ratio ended the quarter at 9.5%, up 20 basis points from last quarter, and at the targeted level outlined in our capital plan. For all other bank risk-based ratio, we were between 21% and 23%, well in excess of regulatory thresholds.","At the parent, our ratio has increased across the board as well. We ended the quarter with a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 6.4%, up 40 basis points from the prior quarter. Our risk-based measures at the parent are between 12% and 16%, again well in excess of regulatory requirements.","In addition, the Fed recently announced the final rules for its implementation of Basel III capital requirements. The phase-in of the adopted rules is scheduled to begin in 2015, and banks will be required to comply with the fully phased-in requirements by 2019.","I would like to highlight the changes that impact us the most. Noting that we view the overall impact of the new rules as very favorable. First, the risk weightings for our mortgage loans will remain unchanged from their treatment under current Fed rules. This is a favorable change from what's previously outlined in the NPR. Second, the risk weightings for our margin loans, which we currently weight at 100%, will decline as they are considered fully collateralized and generally qualify for 0% risk weighting under the new rules. Third, the final rule gives us the option as to whether we include in our regulatory capital, unrealized gains or losses on securities carried in AOCI. Given our balance sheet structure of deposits funding securities and the potential volatility related to changes in the securities markets, we certainly intend to elect for the exclusion of AOCI from our capital. Fourth and consistent with the initial NPR, trust preferred securities will be excluded from capital with the phase-out beginning in 2015. So in summary, with respect to our Tier 1 common calculations, assuming the full implementation of the revised capital rules, our current levels of 21.6% and 12.2% for the banking parent, respectively, would improve to 30.8% and 18% based on the new rules. The full phase-out of TRUPs on our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio will reduce our current level of 6.4% to 5.3% on a pro forma basis. Overall, we feel very good about our capital position.","Moving to progress on our capital plan. We continue to execute well on the plans and feel confident in our ability to achieve our capital goals. Our de-risking continues to progress, the buildout of ERM is on track and our capital ratios are improving, driven by earnings and our deleveraging actions. In that vein, during the second quarter, we completed an additional $800 million in deleveraging actions to bring our completed total to $8.7 million. This falls within our original plan of $5 billion to $10 billion in deleveraging, and just above our goal of $8.5 billion. While we may take some tactical actions in future periods, we consider our deleveraging efforts to be complete.","With respect to our wholesale borrowings, we had a slight increase during the quarter, specifically in our repo and Federal Home Loan Bank advances of $500 million. This was simply due to large amounts of customer net buying activity right at the quarter end. This activity was temporarily funded with wholesale borrowings to allow for an orderly reduction in the balance sheet, which has already occurred in the month of July.","In closing, we feel very good about the quarter and our solid results across our customer, capital and credit metrics. As I sit here today and reflect back on our capital plan that we developed just 1 year ago, we are quite proud of what we accomplished. We have refinanced our high-cost debt, completed the planned amounts of deleveraging, completed our cost reduction programs and achieved a 9.5% leverage ratio at the Bank. These were not easy tasks, but our teams worked incredibly hard, and were able to make significant progress on our capital plan in a relatively short period of time. With that, operator, we will open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess, my first question is on the market maker and the sale. And, I guess, you did go through that there won't be, I guess, income statement impact, but could you walk us through, Matt, like even an estimate of what do you think of the proceeds and where would any gains or benefit go given that the market maker doesn't sit under the bank? Would it go -- would any proceeds go right to the parent?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure, Rich. So I think I'd look at it into 2 pieces. So any proceeds directly associated with selling the business would be outside of the Bank. So it would go to parent. To the extent there were any proceeds or prepayments associated with an order flow agreement or payment, that would go to E*TRADE securities, which is within the Bank. So really, all depends on what structure we ultimately have.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And -- okay, I can ask more about that after. The one follow-up I have and to change the subject would be, the enterprise risk management, it seems like you upped the investment there. That looks like the remaining thing. If you look at from what you said in the past conference calls about requesting the regulators to upstream capital, your earnings improved, you're at 9.5% Tier 1 leverage at the Bank, the cost cutting is done. So is there a possibility that you could request upstreaming capital before year end given you've got everything else looks like in place?","Matthew J. Audette","So we feel good about the momentum, Rich. I think our plans are still the same. While we laid out the capital plan a year ago, it feels very good to be executing on that plan and executing well, but I think our plans are still the same towards the end of this year. I think you're right on the specific quantifiable and measurable things in the capital plan. We've done those, but it's really an overall picture. So making sure we get all the year end buildout is incredibly important. And I can't speak for the regulators, but I suspect they look at this in a very sophisticated way or they're going to look at the entire picture. So while we feel good about the path that we're on, that path is still towards the end of this year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Steven Chubak.","Steven J. Chubak - Autonomous Research LLP","I guess, my first question is regarding some of the color you provided on the FDIC assessment fees and your expectation that, that will continue to come down gradually. I didn't know what the process was on the regulator side in terms of how they would go about, I guess, reviewing your CAMELS rating, how often that would occur because, I guess, my understanding is that it's usually an annual process and therefore, typically, you'll see, I guess, potentially a meaningful step down if they decide that you've executed well on the balance sheet cleansing, implemented the enterprise risk management and basically undergone all of the initiatives that would support a reduction in those fees.","Matthew J. Audette","So the FDIC rate, as it sounds like you know, is a very complex formula. So regulatory ratings are part of that formula. Your capital ratios are part of the formula, I mean, liquidity levels. There's a lot of different things that go in there and it's refreshed every quarter, right? So just we'll file our financial reports and they'll be refreshed each quarter. So it's going to change every quarter depending on how those things go. Obviously, I can't speak to any details on the regulatory rating side, but that's how that formula works. So I would expect it to change over time.","Steven J. Chubak - Autonomous Research LLP","Okay. You have no sense as to how long it would potentially take in some of the initiatives that you've taken to get to that $60 million target or is it just within their control so it's difficult to project?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. I have no additional color. I mean, all of the things that we are working on, improving our capital ratios, improving our credit quality, all of those things are things that ultimately lead to a lower FDIC rate. So they're all in sync and there's really -- there's no additional color beyond that.","Steven J. Chubak - Autonomous Research LLP","Okay. And then I suppose moving to another part of the expense space, just the clearing and servicing expense. We've seen a pretty, I guess, consistent reduction in the size of your loan portfolio. And didn't know how we should be thinking about the pace of, I guess, the reduction in clearing and servicing costs as the loan portfolio continues to shrink? Is that going to follow on lockstep? Is there a lag that we should be thinking about? Or, I guess, any incremental color would be helpful.","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. So it'll trend down over time with the size of the loan portfolio. The only nuance there is the servicing of delinquent loans, foreclosing of loans. Those types of costs don't necessarily trend with the loan balance size. They get a little bit lumpy. So that makes it a little bit difficult to predict in the short term, right, in individual quarters. But over the long term, those costs should trend down in line with the loan portfolio.","Steven J. Chubak - Autonomous Research LLP","And then last one for me. Just -- thank you for providing a lot of detailed color on the capital ratio. I didn't know if you could disclose your Tier 1 leverage ratio on a Basel III basis.","Matthew J. Audette","Yes, we did. So it comes down at the parent around 100 basis points, went over 100 basis points. So 6.4%, the parent down to 5.3%.","Steven J. Chubak - Autonomous Research LLP","And to 5.3%, okay.","Matthew J. Audette","And basically, the primary impact is the trust preferreds coming out.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Carrier.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First, to some of the market making, Matt, I don't know, did you give of the expenses like related to that business when you were given some of the items in terms of how the revenues would be impacted?","Matthew J. Audette","I did, but if you look at the income statement, the revenues for market making are the principal transactions line, which is -- have been just over $20 million for the past few quarters. The expenses are primarily in the clearing line, as well as compensation and benefits. The margins for that business, I would put in the 10% to 20% range, right? So without giving all the detail of where the expenses go, I would view margins as 10% to 20% off of that $21 million per quarter revenue.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then probably just 2 other kind of items. The first is just the reduction on the overall Tier 1 leverage ratio. Would that have any impact -- I know you guys have focused on the bank loan leverage ratio, but would that have any impact of the capital plan? And then just in terms of the items in the income statement, the fees and service charges, you might have mentioned this, but I just missed it in your prepared comments, but was there anything in there that elevated that this quarter?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure. So the leverage ratio at the parent, so that's -- you can imagine that our capital plan is both a bank capital plan and the parent capital plan. So it's covered in there. I think the most measurable thing is really getting to a point where we have dividends going from the bank to the parent. So I think our objective is absolutely to increase the leverage ratio at the parent as well. But the more near-term objective is focused on the banks, so that's why we tend to focus on that. Now fees and service charges, so there's a few things going on there. One, you've got payment for order flows. So to the extent you've got a quarter where commissions are going up, you would also expect fees and service charges going up. Our DARTs were up slightly this quarter, but there was 4 more trading days in the quarter, so the commissions went up a little bit more than the DART increase would imply. So you have the same nuance going on in fees and service charges. The other thing that goes in the fees and service charges is the revenue associated with our managed products, right? So our managed investment portfolios and mutual funds and things like that, so that nice recurring income. As that product continues to build and as all those products continue to build, that recurring fee income is going to increase. And then we got a little bit of seasonality. So Q2 is proxy season, so you've got the proxy season there. So everything else being equal, you've got a little bit of seasonality pushing the fees and service charges up. So a good run rate would be a slight decline in the mid- to upper 30s next quarter, everything else being equal.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So question about the spread this quarter. I'm just wondering if you guys can give us a little bit more detail as to how exactly that spread went up. I mean I got it that, that interest rates generally rose, but I don't think really any of your competitors are going to be able to achieve a growth in the spread, plus your rate on your securities portfolio tends to be higher than your peers. So can you help us understand exactly what dynamics were driving the spread higher?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure. So it's the overall interest rate environment improving, which manifests itself in a spread improvement in 2 places. One is prepayments slowing down, particularly on the securities portfolios. So if you look at the yield table we put out in the release, the available-for-sale securities and the held-to-maturity securities, you see those yields going up. And it's really a slowdown in prepayments on securities that are on the books at a premium, right? So you when you have prepayments, that premium hurts your spread. So as those prepayments slow down, it helps to improve it. And then second, which is less of an impact this quarter, but we would expect to be more of an impact over the long term if interest rates continue on the path that they're on, is the reinvestment rates have improved. So if you go back 6 months ago, our reinvestment rates were more in the 100-basis-point range. I would say for this quarter, they were -- the interest rates are pretty volatile, so it's anywhere from 150 to 200 basis points of reinvestment rates in the quarter. And if you look at the forward curves, they would imply that those reinvestment rates are going to continue to go up from here. So those are really the 2 big buckets that impact it, prepayments and reinvestment rates.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And where are you reinvesting today? I mean, what kind of securities are you? And what is the average portfolio duration would you say?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes, there's been no change in the types of securities that we're investing in, right? So there are government guaranteed or government-backed, mortgage-backed securities that we put in either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity bucket. Our general interest rate philosophy is to run a relatively matched book, not completely matched, but relatively matched. So we're going to focus on the duration of our deposits, that's really going to drive where we're investing on the asset side, and that's anywhere from the 2.5 to 3.5 years of a duration. So it's kind of where we mirror it on the asset side.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So my first question is how do you think about growth of the bank and bank assets at this point? If I recall correctly, you've kind of said that now you're done with these different measures you've taken to shrink the bank, it's probably going to grow along with the client deposits. Is that the right way to think about it?","Matthew J. Audette","It is, Patrick. Keep in mind, over the long term, we want to run off the wholesale funding, right? So if you take the $500 million growth that's already runoff for the month of July, you've got $5.5 billion of wholesale funding that over the very long term, we want to run off. But absent that, customer deposits are absolutely going to drive the size of the balance sheet.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, my second question is, is it just -- can you give more color on your operating expense run rate? I think you did a little bit better this quarter than the guidance last quarter led us to, but it sounds like you're going to be doing some reinvestments over the next couple of quarters to pursue some growth opportunities. And so was it mid-260s is the kind of the right run rate to think about going forward?","Matthew J. Audette","It is. So if you look at this quarter and you back out the goodwill impairments, as well as the restructuring other exit activity line, which are really costs to implement the cost reduction program, we're at $262 million. So I think that the mid-260s is a good run rate for the remainder of the year.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Howard Chen.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Matt, the 240-basis-point net interest spread in 2014 you spoke to, assuming the forward curve holds true, can you just walk through what you're assuming for overall balance sheet size and mix duration of the securities portfolio? Any further funding actions you might take to get to that broad level?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure, Howard. It's really the interest rate environment. So the assumptions of the balance sheet are really driven by customer activity. You could -- you would assume that we'd have some level of growth in deposit side, but I wouldn't say it's meaningful. I'd say that the primary driver of the spread would be a change in the interest rate environment, not a change in the balance sheet or change of duration or anything like that.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But it assumes just the normal gravity of the loan burn down and remix into the securities portfolio?","Matthew J. Audette","Correct, correct. So we're -- from a loan coming down around $400 million per quarter for at least for the rest of this year. I would expect as we get into 2014, that $400 million's probably going to get a little bit smaller, but it does assume they continue to write-down the loan portfolio.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And what does that do to the duration of the securities book during the course of '14?","Matthew J. Audette","So consistent with the earlier question, so that we would focus the securities book really to get, to be relatively matched in the liability side. So the 2.5 to 3.5 years is how we view it.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick numbers-related questions, was there any severance expense this quarter?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. So if you look -- and if solely, we're structuring other exit activities that round at $10 million, about $7 million of that was severance.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Alex Blostein.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just, I guess, staying on the net interest margin outlook and the comment you guys made about the prepay amortization in the quarter, can you -- 2 questions there. I guess, a, can you size how much premium amortization is on a run rate basis going forward? And the modeling assumptions you guys make while calculating that, does that include sort of any onetime catch-up benefits that we might have seen this quarter or are you doing this kind of like more in the linear basis?","Matthew J. Audette","So -- yes, we don't have the breakout here of how much the premiums impact to get. But the impact of the rates, we're not assuming prepayment rates over time and impacting them on the yield this quarter. It's really the prepayments that occurred during the quarter. So inherent in those comments, we had less prepayments and therefore less premium right off this quarter versus last quarter was the driver of the increase.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. But I guess, you're not assuming further slowdown in the prepayments from here. Is that fair?","Matthew J. Audette","No. We absolutely are. So if you think about the improvement from slightly above 230 this year to 240 next year, the primary driver that's going to be an improvement in the interest rate environment, and the 2 ways that, that will manifest itself to drive that spread up are going to be better reinvestment rates and lower prepayments. So that's the driver both in this quarter and in our expectations for 240 next year.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. All right, that's helpful. Would you say it's about even or reinvestment is more of a benefit than the slowdown in prepays?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. I don't have the break out between the 2.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then question on the home equity book. I think in the past, you guys mentioned how much of the loans that are not yet amortizing are already paying down the principal even today. Is there a sense how much that was in the quarter?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes, we didn't update that. I would say it hasn't changed meaningfully. What we said last quarter was 40% of those had made principal payments of $500 or more in the past year. And of that, half of them or 20% had made principal payments of 2,500 or more. As we said, last quarter, it hasn't -- we didn't update it but hasn't moved meaningfully.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joel Jeffrey.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question. It looks like for the average for the quarter margin loan stayed relatively flat, which seems kind of consistent with what a lot of your peers were reporting. But it looks like there might have been an uptick towards the end of the quarter. Is that a trend that's continuing into the third quarter?","Matthew J. Audette","So we don't have a third quarter update on it, but you're right. So the average for the quarter was $5.7 billion. We did end the quarter at $6 billion. But we -- I don't have an update for July for you.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. But I mean, would you say that people are getting more willing to put on risk in terms of the equities market at this point?","Paul Thomas Idzik","Well I think it would be a fair assumption that with DARTs coming down in the month of July versus June, margins probably moved a little bit in the same direction, meaning come down a little bit.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just last for me, I apologize if I missed this, but what percentage of your agency securities are floating and what percentage are fixed?","Matthew J. Audette","We didn't break it down on the call. We usually break it out in the Qs and Ks, so we'll have -- we should have that in the filing but I don't have that here today.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to ask a little bit about marketing, came down again, obviously, came down this quarter. It sounds like you're engaging Ogilvy & Mather going forward. I know you wanted to do a smarter spending on the marketing front. But how should we think about that moving forward in the longer term?","Paul Thomas Idzik","Well I think we're still in the beginning of having Liza develop her plan both internally and with her external agencies. And I think you're going to have to stay tune to find out what that is. I suggest that it's likely to tick up a bit. But I think what's most important is not only what you see us doing outside, but what we're doing to do a better job representing good value and good opportunities to our client base. So some of the marketing you won't see going outside. You'll see it direct to the existing customers and that's -- we think that's an attractive way to drive more money to the bottom line for our shareholders.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of David Chiaverini.","David J. Chiaverini - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So you mentioned about how you're running a matched book, but at the same time, you'll benefit from higher reinvestment rates. So are you able to highlight the sensitivity to the net interest spread assuming, say, 100-basis-point parallel upward shift in the yield curve?","Paul Thomas Idzik","So we run a relatively matched book right? Not an exactly matched book. So there's certainly some interest rate sensitivity there. So I don't have the precise numbers other than we absolutely do benefit in a rising rate environment. But I don't have the specific numbers versus 100 basis points. But it would definitely go up.","David J. Chiaverini - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, okay. And then shifting to the HELOC portfolio, so do you have a sense of how much the payment would increase out in 2015 and 2016? You mentioned 26% of the book changing payments in 2015, to 41%, 2016. Do you have a dollar amount before and after that shift occurs?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. So the home equity, the HELOC books are relative -- the average of loan balances are relatively small. So for the entire portfolio, the average balance is around $75,000. So the payment increase we're talking about is a few hundred dollars a month. So it's certainly relatively small.","David J. Chiaverini - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Now that's a few hundred dollars on what base?","Matthew J. Audette","I don't have the percent increase. When you think about a payment increase, it's not a few thousands, it's a hundreds. So that's how we look at it, but I don't have the percent increase for you.","Operator","That's all the time we have for questions for today. I'll now turn the call back over to you.","Matthew J. Audette","All right. Thanks, everybody. I appreciate the time. We'll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Good evening and thank you for joining us to reflect on what has been a meaningful quarter for E*TRADE. We kicked off the year with solid play by all our lines, as we posted strong results, continued to roll out enhancements to our customer offering, and deployed a considerable quantum of capital to shareholders.","Amidst a market environment characterized by trepidation and unease, we posted respectable growth in the business as our customers remained relatively active. Our results again benefited from the dwindling size and better-than-expected performance of our legacy loan portfolio, and we made significant progress on our premeditated march toward a $50 billion balance sheet. Meanwhile, we began managing the bank to a lower Tier 1 leverage ratio, distributed a considerable amount of capital to the parent, and continued to put capital to work for our owners.","Starting with our results. We reported net income of $153 million, or $0.53 per share for the quarter. On the metrics, customer activity increased sequentially, a trend that is typical in Q1. We also traditionally expect an uptick in activity from our corporate services customers in Q1 and that trend was less pronounced, attributable to the underperformance of the market. Options contributed a steady 23% of total DARTs. Additionally, the portion of trades executed via mobile platforms held steady at 16%. In April to date, DARTs are tracking down 1% from March.","In terms of sentiment, Q1 presented a bleak opening for our customers as the markets kicked off January with one of the worst starts in history. Confidence in activity improved through the quarter, and by March end, it seemed the Cimmerian curtain had lifted. The sum total of this quarter's activity was solid, with our customers being net buyers of $1.2 billion of securities, while exhibiting some purposeful de-risking behavior. Margin balances were dialed back by slightly over $1 billion with balances averaging $6.7 billion and ending the period at $6.3 billion. In April to-date, balances are flat where they ended the quarter.","Meanwhile, we continued to post solid growth. Excluding the impact of shuttering our Hong Kong and Singapore operations, we added 45,000 net new brokerage accounts during the quarter, while our adjusted attrition rate improved to 7.3%, both of which represent our best quarterly marks in two years.","We added $2.9 billion of net new brokerage assets during the quarter, healthy for Q1, but down from $3.5 billion a year ago primarily due to lower activity from our stock plan customers. Our focus on retirement, investing, and savings is present in this metric as one-quarter of these flows were into retirement accounts.","Q1's results also included a $0.10 per share income tax benefit, and some important changes to our reporting and segments. And Mr. Pizzi will elegantly walk you through each of those. There is one element I will highlight, however, which is the impact of these changes on our operating margin calculation, reducing it by about 2 percentage points, making our equivalent target 37% for this year.","Also, you'll find that we present this metric both straight up, and adjusted, which excludes provision for loan losses this quarter, the latter being the measure to which we manage our spending. While we are ever-mindful of the impact that provision can have on our bottom line and our capital, we don't view it as a key factor governing our investments in the business. That said, a large benefit is not a license to spend, nor would we ignore any meaningful charges.","And with that context out of the way, we posted an adjusted operating margin of 34% in Q1, below our full year target of 37%, yet broadly in line with our expectations given the timing of balance sheet growth and seasonality in comp and advertising.","The performance of the loan portfolio exceeded our expectations, and our results included a net benefit in the charge-off line, a first for the company. We continue to benefit from recoveries, along with better-than-expected performance of HELOC conversions, which we are now more than halfway through. This diminishing portfolio ended the quarter at just $4.7 billion.","On to capital, where we delivered some remarkable numbers and progress this quarter, across each stage of the capital lifecycle: generation, distribution, and deployment. Talking about our generation of capital, we've done a lot, both from an earnings standpoint as well as through lower capital thresholds. The progress we've made acutely reflects our improved financial position and regulatory progress, which are proof positive of all the work the entire team has done on the enterprise risk management front, the enhancements we've made to our operations and leadership team, as well as the continued and marked improvement to our overall risk profile.","Concordant with our much improved stature is the freedom we've earned to internally distribute the capital we generate, continuing to benefit from improved flexibility at the bank and companywide. This quarter we distributed a hefty $400 million to the parent, well above our typical contribution. This included capital from the bank, both formed through earnings, and liberated through the 100 basis points drop in our target leverage ratio, and capital from our brokers, from the earnings of our introducing broker and the extraction of excess capital from our dealing broker.","One related element of note: while we achieved a reduction in our bank leverage ratio to 8%, well ahead of our original plan, we have our sights set on continued improvement to our capital efficiency there, and aim to manage closer to 7.5% in early 2017. This, of course, is our aspiration, and would require regulatory approval.","On capital deployment, we exceeded $350 million in cumulative share repurchases during the quarter, putting us nearly halfway through our current authorization, just a few months after embarking on the program.","While market dislocations during the quarter presented us with opportunities to be aggressive buyers of our stock, we aim to continue buybacks at a more modest pace, with an eye on completing the current $800 million program by year-end. We are devotees of buybacks, as they allow us to return capital to shareholders efficiently and with low risk.","With regard to additional capital deployment, we're progressing on growing our balance sheet to $49.5 billion, adding $2.5 billion during the period. We intend to reach our target size this quarter.","In exploring other avenues to put capital to work, we continue to focus on growth, with acquisition as one method to achieve that goal. This quarter, we sharpened our focus, and I'd like to walk through our current thinking.","We believe scaled acquisitions in the brokerage space make the most sense. We also look for opportunities to bolster our capabilities through acquisition and consideration of our retirement, investing and savings vertical, as well as our corporate services channel. However, we continually evaluate build versus buy on this front.","Specific to acquisitions in the banking space, our areas of focus include innovative financial technology within custody and payment services; and trust and wealth management offerings, to the extent we find a logical fit in support of our current strategy.","Now, we certainly understand there has been significant investor interest around acquisitions that could result in credit exposure, and I'd like to summarize our present thinking on this. To the extent we would consider taking on credit exposure through acquisition, it would have to exceed a substantially higher hurdle for returns, to ensure the benefits and associated risks would truly be worthy of our owners' capital and management's time.","To make this point very clear, we will not explore acquisitions in a traditional banking model unless it is overwhelmingly compelling for shareholders. We have come too far as a company to go round the bend by assuming unwarranted risk through an injudicious acquisition. We also continue to evaluate other options for capital deployment, including share repurchases beyond our current program, and balance sheet growth beyond $50 billion. Mr. Pizzi will provide color on how we measure these options.","With respect to enhancements and rollouts, Q1 was a busy quarter. To cover a few of the highlights. We continued to expand our industry-leading mobile offerings as we incorporated customer feedback to increase customization capabilities on the mobile dashboard. As mobile continues to become a channel for long-term investors as much as for active traders, we also introduced a mobile retirement center, helping customers plan their retirement savings with a calculator tool, and easily open an IRA or rollover an existing 401(k) account.","On our website, we upgraded our income estimator tool, which now provides an improved logic that can be applied to securities within a watch list and can seamlessly send any stock, ETF, or mutual fund through for execution. Most recently, we rolled out a new dashboard in E*TRADE Pro, creating a home base for our most active traders to track the markets, manage their portfolios, and much more, in a consolidated manner.","We have a pipeline of great tools, features, and new experiences in store for our customers this year. So stay tuned. I look forward to sharing more with you.","We've just emerged from our industry's awards season with an ample assortment of accolades, receiving high marks from Barron's and NerdWallet, nine best-in-class distinctions from StockBrokers.com, which includes earning the number one mobile app, three Gold awards from Corporate Insight, and an honoree designation from the Webby Awards.","Our industry also witnessed one of the more impactful pieces of overreaching regulation seen in recent history. The Department of Labor's ruling on the applicability of the Fiduciary Standard. First, I want to state unequivocally that we support efforts to advance the best interests of retail investors, and will work within the new regulatory guidelines to continue to deliver guidance on our customers' terms, and provide services that help investors take control of their financial health.","We're also pleased that the DoL heeded many of the industry's concerns regarding the initial draft, delivering a final rule that is less burdensome than originally proposed. We believe as a matter of principle that all who serve the retail investor should be held to the highest standards when it comes to working in their best interest. At the same time, we believe this pursuit must be balanced against ensuring investors continue to have seamless access to investment support, and the greatest variety of financial choices at their disposal, to help them trade, invest, and save.","We're still working through the ruling's significance, but are confident it'll have minimal impact on our ability to properly serve our customers.","On the leadership front, I'm very pleased to welcome an addition to our executive suite, as we concluded our comprehensive search for a new Chief Risk Officer earlier this month, appointing Ms. Ellen Koebler to the post. With a risk management career spanning nearly two decades at a handful of large and complex financial institutions, Ellen brings considerable fire power to this crucial function and to our Executive Committee.","As Ellen comes on board, our unassailable Acting CRO and the original architect of E*TRADE's Risk organization, Mr. Paul Brandow, has graciously agreed to stay on in an advisory capacity to me and the entire executive management team. I'm happy to know we'll continue to benefit from his sage perspective and consummate insight.","In closing, as I think about 2016, we have a lot of exciting things in the works on the customer experience front, and we'll continue to ruthlessly pursue the best path forward on capital deployment. I look forward to keeping you apprised.","And with that I'll turn it over to our sedulous CFO, Mr. Pizzi.","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you Mr. Idzik. For the quarter, we reported adjusted net income of $122 million or $0.43 per share. This excludes $31 million, or a $0.10 per share tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance against state deferred tax assets.","Our results compare to $89 million or $0.30 per share in the prior quarter. It also compares to adjusted net income of $85 million or $0.29 per share in the year-ago quarter, which excludes the loss on early extinguishment of corporate debt.","Before I delve into the details of our income statement, I'd like to review the changes we made to our reporting this quarter. For those of you following along, these changes are laid out graphically in our quarterly financial supplement on about.etrade.com under the quarterly earnings section. There, you will also find realigned financials going back through 2014. I'll refer to those during this call.","We consolidated our business segments and realigned both our income statement and yield table, all of which are reflective of how we currently manage the business. As for the specifics, beginning with segment reporting, we collapsed our operating segments and are now presenting only consolidated financial results.","With the vast majority of our legacy costs in the rearview mirror, and the management of our balance sheet now focused solely on maximizing the value of customer deposits, we thought it was the right time to wave goodbye to the balance sheet management segment as well as the corporate category.","We also realigned our income statement, moving our below-the-line items into revenue and expenses. Most notable among those changes is that corporate interest expense is now included in net interest income. Additionally, other income and expense was moved into the gains and losses on securities and other revenue line. And losses on early extinguishment of debt are now included within the non-interest expense section.","Taking a deeper dive into net interest income, we are now reporting net interest margin, as opposed to spread. After all, most of you already call it NIM. Now onto the result.","Revenue for the quarter were $472 million, up from $439 million in the prior quarter attributable to higher net interest income as both net interest margin and balance sheet size increased sequentially, and up from $441 million in the year-ago quarter as a result of the termination of wholesale borrowings, the Fed rate hike, and the corporate debt reduction and refinance.","Net interest income of $287 million improved $17 million from the prior quarter driven by a 7 basis point improvement in the net interest margin on a $1.4 billion larger average interest earning balance sheet. Our net interest margin of 281 basis points increased as a result of the full quarter impact of the Fed rate hike coupled with slower prepayment speeds on the securities portfolio, but was partially offset by lower margin balances. Because we guided to spread on our last call, I'll tell you that based on our prior reporting, our spread for the quarter would have been 294 basis points. Meaning, we significantly outperformed our expectations of high 270 basis points.","As for our expectations for the full year, holding the Fed Funds rate constant, and doing the same to margin balances, we expect our net interest margin for the full year to be in the 260 basis points to 265 basis points range. Adjusted for the reporting changes, this is consistent with our previous guidance. Note that our significant outperformance in Q1 is offsetting our expectation for NIM to contract in the remainder of the year. For Q2 specifically, we expect it to land in the mid-260 basis points.","Commissions, fees and service charges, and other revenues were $175 million, up $15 million from the prior quarter and down just modestly versus the year-ago quarter. Two main factors contributed to the fluctuations. First, customer activity increased 12% versus Q4, but decreased 3% versus the year-ago period. And second, improved rates on off-balance sheet cash helped drive increases in fees and service charges relative to both periods.","On the latter, the average rate earned on off-balance sheet cash was 30 basis points in Q1, up 17 basis points from Q4 as a result of the full quarter impact of the December rate hike. Keep in mind, this is a gross number. So net of the fees paid to our third party platform administrator, we earned 24 basis points on average in the period.","Average commission per trade of $10.64 declined $0.02 from the prior quarter and $0.30 from the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year decline was driven by a lower contribution from stock plan customer trades and fewer options contracts per trade. Securities and other gains were $10 million, flat with the prior quarter. For the full year, we expect gains to be in the $30 million to $40 million range.","Non-interest expense for the quarter was $312 million, up $7 million from the prior quarter, which included $14 million in non-recurring charges. Excluding those items, the $21 million sequential increase was driven primarily by compensation and benefits, which reflect the full quarter impact of the hires we made in Q4 as well as seasonality related to compensation.","We remain highly attuned to the operating environment, and the impact it has on how we manage our expenses. As Paul mentioned, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 34%. Our target for the year remains 37%, the equivalent of 39% prior to our reporting changes. For Q2 specifically, we expect expenses to decrease approximately $10 million sequentially, primarily related to lower marketing spend.","Provision for the quarter was a benefit of $34 million, needless to say, better than we expected. Net charge-offs were also positive at $3 million of recoveries, resulting in a $31 million reduction in the allowance to $322 million. Meanwhile, the overall portfolio itself reduced by $284 million, or 6%, to $4.7 billion.","In addition to the positive impact of recoveries, our provision benefit also reflected better-than-expected performance of converted HELOCs that were previously classified as high risk and had been reserved for using the full life of loan loss expectation. This includes balloon loans, of which there are just $25 million remaining, the vast majority of which will convert in the current quarter.","In total, we had $213 million of HELOCs convert to amortizing loans during Q1, which puts us more than halfway through the conversions. Performance in Q1 was consistent with the observations we discussed last quarter where the default rate of the converting loan is about twice that of the non-converting loan, at approximately 12%.","So while we have been pleasantly surprised by performance to-date, please keep in mind that we have a sizeable pipeline of conversions through Q1 of next year. For this reason, we expect our provision to be approximately zero, with the caveat that recoveries of a greater than expected magnitude could again result in a provision benefit.","One final note on the P&L regarding the tax benefit we recorded this quarter. With the move of our broker dealers behind us, we took a hard look at our organizational alignment and found an opportunity to reinstate the tax treatment of our broker dealers prior to moving them under the bank. The tax election resulted in a release of valuation allowance against the associated state deferred tax assets. We are always looking for ways to deliver for shareholders and were pleased to uncover additional value in this pursuit.","Moving on to capital, we distributed nearly $400 million up to the parent during the quarter, comprising the following. $248 million from the bank, which included $97 million from the prior quarter's net income, and $151 million as a result of our reduced bank leverage ratio; and $148 million from the brokers, which included $24 million of excess capital generation at the introducing broker, as well as $124 million from the clearing broker.","In the second quarter, we expect total dividends to the parent of approximately $190 million from the bank and brokers. Starting with the bank, since balance sheet growth consumes bank capital and directly impacts our leverage ratio, in Q2, we will request an $85 million dividend to the parent, which is below the prior quarter bank net income of $108 million.","From the introducing broker, we anticipate $27 million to the parent, as part of the standard quarterly distribution. And from the clearing broker, we plan to move $75 million. We continually assess the capital position of the entity, and based on the business environment, we may periodically move surplus capital.","We remain in the midst of two capital deployment initiatives, balance sheet growth and share repurchases. On the former, we expect to reach our targeted balance sheet size by the end of the current quarter. At that point, based on Q1 deposits, we would have $2 billion in off-balance sheet deposits available to onboard.","With respect to the cost of exceeding $50 billion, we completed additional work during the quarter, and our initial estimate remains intact, which is $50 million over two years related to the build-out, with an annual recurring component of roughly $15 million. So to justify these expenses, along with the capital required to be held against the assets, we need some combination of higher rates and an abundance of customer cash. So for the time being, we plan to hold steady under the $50 billion mark.","On share repurchases, as Paul highlighted, we are nearly halfway through the $800 million program, having picked up nearly 15 million shares at an average price of $23.81. To elaborate on our internal parameters regarding utilizing capital for repurchases, while corporate cash is a clear measure of our dry powder, we are also mindful of our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio, which we manage to a floor of 7.0%, meaning we would not utilize capital to the extent it would put us below this level. We ended the quarter with corporate cash of $482 million and consolidated Tier 1 leverage of 7.8%, which provides the ability to make substantial progress on our program.","And with that, operator, we will open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. You may proceed with your question.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah. Good evening, Paul. Good evening, Mike.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hello, Rich. Always nice to hear from the doyen of the industry.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Thank you. The checking line definitely contributed here with the provision. I'm just trying to see \u2013 you don't expect it to contribute like it did. And is the performance that you're seeing there, I know we still got half the amortization portfolio to go, but are we still \u2013 it just feels like we're conservative given the last couple of quarters and the amount of reversals we've seen in that line.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Mike is going to talk to it in more detail. But Rich, our models and what we have set aside goes through a tremendous amount of scrutiny, not only from our own people, but from our accountancy firm and also from our regulators. So, I just think we just need to keep that in context as we think about it. But Mike, I know you have stuff to add here.","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Rich, I would keep in mind that as we move through time, we're moving into later vintage loans, with the loans this year being really converting 2006 vintage, next year would be 2007. So, the remaining 50% is of vintages that are largely thought to be of lower quality. So that may help put this in perspective a little bit.","The other point I would call-out is, while we did have $3 million of recoveries through the charge-off line, they are not coming from the current loan population. And so that elevated recovery number that we see that's really been really very influential in the last few quarters is very difficult to forecast on a go-forward basis. And that's what contributes to coming out where we are on the current allowance.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Got it. Okay, helpful. Thank you. And then just \u2013 I'm going to ask about interest rate sensitivity, and we looked at the presentation and it's hard to compare given the new \u2013 the adjustments to the NII. But is there incremental \u2013 like the spread in your presentation is wider. Has anything changed in regards to interest rate sensitivity?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Very little change in regards to interest rate sensitivity. What I will say is given the movement in margin and the movements in cash, and you'll see a higher amount of segregated cash. Those are the items that are directly influencing the small change in the delta in net interest income that you see.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Got it. Okay. And then I guess my last question is on, great quarter, it seem like you beat on every revenue line, but margin loans did drop, it appears a little bit more than peers. Anything going on \u2013 I know you mentioned Paul deleveraging of the consumer, but can you give us some more color on I guess it was \u2013 I think 15% quarter-to-quarter?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Rich, if you go back in history, you will see that while margin balances were building up, ours were building a little faster. And as our customer base decided to derisk, they derisked a little faster and a little more steeply than the competition. So I think it's just a question of the makeup of the relative customer books.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Got it. Okay. That's all I had and congrats on a good quarter.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Rich.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Conor Fitzgerald with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.","Conor Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good evening.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Conor.","Conor Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. So, Paul, I just want to go back to your comments on I think managing the business to be adjusted pre-tax margin. So excluding the reserve release, I think on the last quarter call, you kind of left the door open for maybe you're reinvesting reserve release if they were stronger than you expected back in the business. Should we kind of interpret your comments today as reserve release is totally divorced from your expenses?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. I think what we said is we don't see it as a license to just spend it without regard to our other targets and other obligations we have both to our owners and other things we're trying to accomplish. So that's what we're trying to point to as well as saying if we have worse than expected charges that we would try and still keep to our target. So that's I think what you're hearing us talk about, Conor, is just trying to continue to be as disciplined as we can in managing for the type of results that we think our owners deserve.","Conor Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","If we thought we could put some additional cash to work wisely, we'd be happy to tell you about that.","Conor Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then again on the buyback, I appreciate the comments around the timing and the 7% floor. But if you were to get kind of more aggressive, is it more in your mind you just want to be more deliberate from here on out or are you kind of trying to maybe respond to share price movements when you think about kind of the pace and the timing. Is it more steady or are you going to try to be a little more dynamic?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think you saw an acceleration in the quarter that was definitely in response to the market. I think we will remain as dynamic as we can be within the confines of our capital and corporate cash to respond to the overall market environment. But as we said on the call, we see finishing this really within the year really one quarter ahead of the authorization timing.","Conor Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. You may proceed with your question.","Christopher M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, guys. Just wanted to come back to the NIM for a second, the 290-basis points-or-so that you talked about \u2013 294 basis points, I guess, it was for the quarter. What was it that happened that really surprised on the upside. Was it the flow through on rates, the Fed rate hike being a little bit stronger than maybe you guys had anticipated? Is that what drove a lot of it? Just trying to square that relative to the original guidance?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, the Fed rate hike did drive some of it but that was contemplated within the guidance. The main driver of outperformance versus the guidance really had to do with lower than expected pre \u2013 substantially lower than expected prepayment fees on the securities portfolio. And then you will see that even though the margin balance declined, the rate is up more than what the Fed \u2013 more than what the Fed would suggest, meaning the balances that left were at a much lower rate than the average for the portfolio.","Christopher M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got you. Okay. I was going to ask a question on the margin loan, so that's good. All right. Ameritrade, on their call, they talked a little bit about some expenses for DOL. Any thoughts there guys whether you've kind of taken a look at that? I mean, I know we've really just gotten the final ruling out, but anything you could help us there as far as perhaps magnitude or anything qualitatively as well?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I didn't listen to the TD Ameritrade call. But we anticipate being on the meet at our DOL obligations within the target guidance we've given for operating margin. As we've gone through and seen what's occurring out of the regs, we feel our model stands up very well with us not having proprietary product, us having compensation practices that are close to what's desired as it is. And so we're pretty confident we're going to be able to continue to try and drive towards our target operating margin.","Christopher M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please proceed with your question.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi, good evening.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Steven.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","So, I figure will kick it off with a question on capital ratios. You noted that you intend to request an incremental 50 basis point reduction in your targeted bank leverage to 7.5% next year. I just wanted to get a sense as whether 7% is a reasonable end game target that you guys are still contemplating, which from your remarks is consistent with what you're managing to at the parent today?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Steven, we do see others in the industry have a target \u2013 have a 7% handle. And when Mike and I wistfully look across the horizon as the sunsets, our eyes do twinkle thinking about the ability to get down to 7%. We think it's probably a reasonable aspiration we have. And we'll just continue doing what we have been doing in terms of improving our risk profile, taking regulatory guidance seriously, working hard to keep strengthening our enterprise risk management. And with all those things and with the close supervision of our regulators, we're hopeful that we'll be able to get down more towards where we see other competitors in a reasonable period of time.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Understood. Well, thinking about that pro forma balance sheet always brings a twinkle in your eye, I know in the past, you had spoken about some potential benefits linked to a portfolio sales and recognizing there's some different puts and takes. But given the favorable credit performance we've seen and now that you're halfway through, the amortizing HELOCs, is that still an attractive avenue worth pursuing? And does the secondary market actually accommodate that at the moment?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, right now, we still think that holding those assets is in our shareholders' best interest. We, of course, continue to take soundings in the market, and if we felt a better solution would be to sell those to other people. We would certainly do so. And you have my phone number and if you want to buy them, Steven, you just give us a call and we'll talk about it at some point.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Unfortunately I don't think I have deep enough pockets, Paul, but thank you for the offer. And maybe just one more quick one for me. I was hoping you can just give an update on any plans you might have to extinguish the $400 million or so troughs just given that the securities as of the end of this year now fully disallowed from Tier 1 capital?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, Steven, if we look at the securities, they remain reasonably attractive from a debt spread perspective in terms of issuance. So we view them as really just liabilities at this point. To the extent that because they are somewhat illiquid, we see secondary trading in them, if someone's looking to move them, we will from time to time participate there as they can be purchased at a discount, but we have no intent to exercise the regulatory call.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Steven, that's an order of magnitude less than the loan. So we also take a call from you on the troughs.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","That's very kind. I have to take a pass for the moment, but appreciate the offer, and thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Paul, I appreciate the additional color around the M&A strategy in the outlook. I guess, if you could give us some additional commentary maybe around just the current environment. There was some activity in the market and the industry this quarter. I guess, how would you characterize the opportunity set in terms of pricing or actual available properties today?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","You guys are as aware as \u2013 I mean, more aware than almost anyone else regarding what kind of things might fit into each of those categories. But I'll take this opportunity to say that neither Michael nor I, nor our board is going to have us overpay for any property. And I think that's about all we need to say.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And I guess, Mike, a question on NIM, the guidance going to next quarter, margin balances are down, but I think in the previous answer to a question, you highlighted that the rates are up. So just curious as to kind of the outlook and the decline, I guess roughly 15-basis points-or-so quarter-over-quarter and the drivers of that?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, we're anticipating some normalization in the overall security speeds from the very low level that they were in the first quarter of the year. That's going to be the primary driver of the decline in securities yield that we're expecting to get to the guidance range for next quarter and for the full year.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your may proceed with your question.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Congratulations on the nice quarter.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Maybe just a follow-up here on just DOL considerations, definitely appreciate you guys don't anticipate big implications around the ability to provide services for clients. But I'm just trying to think in the near-term, are there any considerations that you guys are thinking about? I'm not sure if we see a slowdown in rollover activity just for some period as the final rule is being digested, or maybe \u2013 or even on the positive side, some evidence that more money is moving towards self-directed just as it's falling through the cracks of the brokerage firms on the retail side. I'm just curious if there's any other considerations we're not talking about?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think there's a whole host of \u2013 irrespective of what firm you are, there's a host of internal operational factors that all of us across the industry are going to have to deal with, even if it's just how you script telephone conversations regarding IRAs. So there is definitely work to be done. And I'm convinced our team is going to be able to do that. I think that this is just another indication that E*TRADE's model within the self-directed industry is going to hold up pretty well and has the right secular trends supporting its continued growth. We see continued movement to digital, continued movement to self-directed. We think those things show up well for what we're trying to do.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then just following-up here on M&A thoughts, another hypothetical, but just curious how you guys would think about the utilization of stock in a deal? Obviously, it's pulled back here a little bit in recent months, but if you're thinking about anything on the brokerage or bank side, how would you think about that? Or just the things that we're kind of talking about or even thinking about, just not of the size that stock would even be necessary?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Devin, it's just really hard to talk about theoreticals, and I don't want to sound like former government officials. But it's really difficult to just comment about theoreticals. So, if we had anything to talk about, we'll be really clear and explain our rational, how we decided to fund it or anything, but we \u2013 it's just difficult to talk theoretically.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. No, that's fair enough. And just last on the NIM, just follow-up here again. On reinvestment rates, where are you guys seeing them right now on the securities portfolio as you're building it out a little bit further and as some are rolling off? And within that outlook, what is implied in sec lending? Just curious where you see that with the lower margin balances.","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Reinvestment rate is about 175 basis point to 200 basis point range. We've been pretty much in that range over the quarter. We're seeing a lot of volatility in rates, but also seeing a lot of volatility in agency spread. So, even on the days where rates moved pretty low, we were still able to purchase at some attractive overall spread levels.","Within securities lending, securities lending did move down with margin, although it's going to ebb and flow both with the size of the margin book as well as the amount of hard to borrows within the book. So, even with the size of the book coming down, you can still see that we did fairly well overall in securities lending this quarter. And I think as the market more normalizes, we'll see the hard to borrow activity pick back up again.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Got it. Great. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good evening, Paul. Good evening, Mike. I have a question unfortunately on M&A. I hear you loud and clear on the high bar to take on credit risk. So, just curious, first of all, what kind of returns you would need to take on said (41:49) credit risk?","And then more broadly, what is the strategic rationale of even considering any current credit risk? I don't know, do you believe you have some sort of competitive edge on evaluating credit, or is there some other kind of strategic rationale that I'm missing?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think, Christian, I think we talked about some of this in some of the public comments we made at some of the conferences. Some of the areas we would look that have wealth management and other areas within that fall within a banking space may come with some credit assets. The return hurdle we're going to apply to any credit asset is going to be well in excess of our cost of capital in terms of putting the appropriate valuation on those businesses, given they come with considerable risk. They are therefore tangential really in overall strategic fit to something that, they come along with something that has a much broader strategic fit.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Got it. And then, pardon if I missed this one in the prepared remarks, but do you have an estimate for the impact of increased FDIC rates in the back half?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","If the FDIC raises its threshold amount in Q3, which our sources lead us to believe they will, it's going to be about $1 million per quarter in increased assessment.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed with your question.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, good evening, folks. Paul, maybe just talk a little bit more about the DOL and your IRA rollover business. Retirement assets I think are close to $50 billion; I guess, first of all, how much of that is in IRAs? And then more strategically, with the DOL rules, how does that impact the stock plan administration business and the strategy of converting those users over to your platform?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We don't break out what portion of retirement assets are IRA versus other. With regard to stock plan business, it shouldn't impact our opportunities of continuing to make those participants great customers of E*TRADE. And in fact may give us some opportunities to have some discussions along the way they may not be getting as well served by some other providers as a result of this.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","You view it as an opportunity essentially more than something that could be burdensome?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, it's definitely burdensome, but I think it's an opportunity for our model relative to others.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay, great. And then just in longer term plan of accelerating organic growth, can you talk a little bit about, from the acquisition side, I guess from a capability perspective, what do you think you need to accelerate that client organic growth. What types of \u2013 is it largely wealth management or do you feel you need more technology like a robo-advisory capability?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we already do have a robo-advisory capability, we've had it for some time. We have a new version coming out later this year and something I look forward to talking more about on a subsequent call. I'd say, there's several fronts for us on this accelerating organic growth.","One, is you will have seen us do some significant hiring over the last year. And that's primarily across hiring more financial consultants, also it has to do with adding along with the account growth, additional customer service people that we're providing the service, and adding some professionals into the corporate services participant experience area where some of our nascent efforts there are actually turning up very nicely.","The second is we interact with every one of our customers digitally, and you're seeing us do things to continue to improve our edge in mobile, and to make our overall web experience and mobile experience the type of experience that makes people want to engage more fulsomely with us and with improving their financial health. So it's a bit of doing a lot of little things better and continuing down the path.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And just lastly on the \u2013 how do you feel your transactional banking capabilities are now. And again, is that something that looks attractive from an acquisition perspective again to cross-sell to your customers and accelerate their organic growth?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, one of the things we are as we said in the prepared comments looking at is more along if you think about the excitement that's taking place in the payments space across some of the Fintech areas, are the type of things that we are starting to look at analytically with regard to that's something we should build, something we want to consider acquiring. But there are definitely ways we can improve some of the capabilities of our banking and banking like activities.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. That's helpful","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Specifically in the payments area.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Payments area. Okay. Thank you very much.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. You may proceed with your question.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks, guys. Mike just a quick one, just on the commission rate, I think you mentioned that the activity in the corporate area was a bit lighter in the first quarter. Have you seen some of that improve with stability in the markets? And would you expect some improvement kind of going into 2Q, which is maybe less seasonal than what's typical?","Michael A. Pizzi - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I can tell you over the course of the quarter, we saw less initial activity in the early months and it did pick-up a little bit in the later months, but not meaningful enough to have an effect on the commission per trade being down $0.02 from Q4. But if you look back to last year, you'll see that typically there's a pretty powerful effect on commission per trade that we didn't see directly come directly through this quarter. Whether we see some of that come through this quarter or not, I think we're going to have to wait and see how things progress.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. And then Paul just one quick one on the M&A or the growth side, I think on one hand when you look at getting through or growing to the $50 billion, you mentioned in a different rate environment maybe if the cash generation was stronger, then you would potentially pursue that. Just wanted to get your sense of what environment that might be?","And then on the strategic side, it seems like there's a ton going on in financials and the tech area, Fintech. On one hand, it seems like that's the pricier area, but on the other hand, it's obviously where the industry is going. And so I just wanted to get your thoughts on how quickly can you build something versus having to acquire something and vice versa? Is there a lot of demand out there for a financial services company for \u2013 on the tech side \u2013 tech firms looking for financial service firms to kind of grow in that space?","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me try and take those in turn. I'd say, the jumping over the $50 billion mark is impacted by two things. I mean, clearly, you want to have a quantum of cash that makes it worth your while to earn on that cash because the costs are the same whether you're at $51 billion or $61 billion.","And the rate environment obviously makes it easier to jump more quickly just do the math. With regard to looking at Fintech opportunities, I think the question for us continues to be how quickly can we deploy something across our customer base and would it bring incremental revenues, would it strengthen the customer tie with our company.","And so we're continuing to look. I do think the valuations make certain deals difficult. And so, we have evaluate that, but speed to market is important. And I'm not all that familiar, I presume some of you guys would be more familiar than I am with a lot of Fintech firms looking at actually acquiring something that's going to get them nicely regulated to the degree, in fact, I don't think they can even possibly imagine. So that would be my way of looking at it.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Yes. All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to you.","Paul Thomas Idzik - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Ashwin, and I again want to thank everyone for joining us for this quarter. I'm particularly proud of the team this quarter and look forward to talking to you in a few months. Thank you. Goodbye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."],"8101":["E*TRADE Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:ETFC) Q3 2017 Earnings Conference Call October 19, 2017  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Karl Roessner - CEO","Michael Pizzi - CFO","Analysts","Rich Repetto - Sandler O'Neill","Steven Chubak - Nomura Instinet","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","Conor Fitzgerald - Goldman Sachs","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Dan Fannon - Jefferies","Chris Harris - Wells Fargo","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Kyle Voigt - KBW","Jeremy Campbell - Barclays","Michael Cyprys - Morgan Stanley","Operator","Good evening and thank you for joining E*TRADE's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call.

No other recordings or copies of this call are authorized or may be relied upon.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Roessner. Please go ahead.","Karl Roessner","Thank you, Jennifer. Good evening and thank you for joining. It's a pleasure to speak with you again, now with a little more than year under our belt as E*TRADE's CEO and especially in the wake of strong results and solid progress across our key initiatives and growth goals. This past quarter, we were busy to say the least. So I'll start with the hit parade and then revisit each elements in more detail.","In early August, we completed the integration of OptionsHouse bringing all of our customers into the E*TRADE ecosystem and capturing all expected revenue and expense synergies. With this work behind us, we have now pivoted our efforts towards the most exciting component of this initiative, unleashing the full power of the industry's top derivatives platform.","On the marketing front, we enjoyed an overwhelmingly positive response to our new brand campaign, driving strong customer growth and increased engagement. We are on to the second phase of our new campaign in which we evolve our messaging to further highlight E*TRADE's value proposition along with new, powerful, and irreverent creative. We continue to improve the customer experience through several enhancements across our services and platforms.","We march forward on our capital deployment initiatives buying back $187 million worth of stock and onboarding customer deposits to grow our balance sheet to slightly north of $60 billion in total assets. We capitalized on the continued improvement to our credit profile and a recent ratings upgrade to refinance our corporate debt, landing a 3-handle on our average coupon for savings of $17 million in annual interest expense. We enjoyed strong customer activity in continuation of the summer's trend and we're now tracking toward our best year in E*TRADE's history for DARTs and customer margin balances.","We made solid progress against our growth objectives with 32% derivatives mix in line with last quarter's record, $4.9 billion in managed assets, year-to-date account growth in our targeted range, and year-to-date asset growth up considerably from last year.","We gained significant ground in our push to win new corporate services clients closing meaningful new business for approximately $8 billion in stock plan assets to come on to our platform in the coming quarters and we generated solid revenue growth against sequential and year ago periods in spite of the shifts to the commission landscape, demonstrating the strength and effectiveness of the E*TRADE model in market environments like today's.","In a nutshell, we're very pleased with our progress and today's results. Results that allow us to focus not just on organic initiatives but also on those strategic ones that further generate value for our shareholders.","As you may know, E*TRADE strives to be the number one digital broker and advisor to self directed traders and investors. Yet with only 10% to 12% share of our customers' investable wealth, we fully recognize that key segments of our customers look elsewhere for hands-on management. Accordingly, we have been searching for the optimal way to approach this population through a superior technology and custody platform in service of independent RIA's.","And within that context I'm thrilled to announce the acquisition of TCA, a leader in the RIA custody space which will enable E*TRADE to tap into a growing segment of our industry while bolstering our ability to retain customers and assets in need of higher touch services. And as you'll recall, this is one of the areas we've been evaluating through an inorganic lens for some time.","Particularly within our corporate services channel where many participant executives leverage our stock plan administration services but seek financial planning and wealth management elsewhere. We want to expand our ability to serve their needs within E*TRADE, by incorporating a custody platform and addressing the advisor services space through select independent advisers on the TCA platform; we dramatically expand the opportunities to capture this wealth.","Additionally we believe the extension of the E*TRADE brand will provide this team with ample opportunities to showcase their superior platform to more advisors. Their technology is truly a standout in the space with an open architecture framework that interacts seamlessly with top platforms for account aggregation, risk profiling, compliance, and CRM.","They offer full mobile accessibility for advisors and end clients, robust customization tools that enable advisors to develop personalized branded applications for their clients, and they package all functionality in one easy to use platform. Further from our interaction with TCA, it's abundantly clear that we are cut from the same cloth. The company has innovation in its DNA and an exciting culture that closely aligns with ours. We fully intend to continue to foster this spirit under their existing structure with their CEO as the head of the unit within the E*TRADE family.","Mike will cover the financial considerations and how we intend to fund the deal which we expect to close during the second quarter of next year.","Now back to our results. Since I took the helm over a year ago, I've outlined and reiterated three core initiatives which we have been tirelessly focused on to fuel our growth and meet our goals.","First is the OptionsHouse integration, second our marketing and third improving the customer experience.","So allow me to walk through where we stand on each one. With regard to the integration following a year's worth of mapping, planning, and hard work we completed the customer conversion during the first week of August. With all of our customers now within one ecosystem and the back and middle office connections forged, we are focused on the more exhilarating task of delivering a top notch experience that caters to derivatives traders, long-term investors, and novice consumers alike. I'm grateful to say that we are placing a checkmark on our \"to do\" list by the word integration. There is still much work to do to deliver a unified product offering that showcases the best of all we have to offer, but it will happen as one company.","As it relates to our reengineered active trader chops, when taken as part of our new active trader offering upon which I will elaborate shortly, we believe we are well poised to welcome more of this attractive segment to E*TRADE, while introducing the power of the derivatives to more Main Street investors.","And on that note following the June launch of our brand campaign, we've been exceptionally pleased with the response to the work we have deployed which is reflected in our brand health, advertising effectiveness scores, and most importantly, in our business results, where we have truly benefited from the improved awareness.","At E*TRADE we're known for our advertising and while we enjoy this reputation we believe it is equally important to understand that our marketing does not begin and end with our ads. Marketing particularly how we approach it is far more. It's how we address our customers and prospects at every touch point from the positioning on our public site to how our offerings are presented across our platforms to the messaging leveraged by our customer service reps to the way our entire set of products and services is packaged together into an overall value proposition.","And in that spirit we're gearing up to complement the brand campaign with the launch of a consolidated offering and value proposition for our active trader segment called Power E*TRADE. This package delivers a one, two, three punch of a best-in-class trading platform backed by support from trading specialists and offered with exceptional pricing.","Qualification for this program is 30 trades per quarter and leverages our lower pricing tier of $4.95 equity trades, $0.50 option contracts and $1.50 futures contracts. At these prices when coupled with exceptional guidance from a dedicated services team and a killer trading platform, we believe, we can grow our market share among active traders and win in this space. The work supporting this program is strong and I look forward to its launch in the weeks to come.","To complement this highly functional product centric work, we'll also shortly rollout phase two of our brand level campaign, \"Don\u2019t get mad. Get E*TRADE.\" Our messaging will continue to evolve further unpacking our value proposition and ensuring that E*TRADE reclaims its mantle as the undisputed home for active traders. After all we are the original place to invest online, stay tuned because it's going to be a fun ride.","In reflecting on all that we've accomplished in such a short period of time, I can confidently say that we have addressed the need to improve our marketing. We are moving steadily in the right direction with bold distinctive marketing that places us back on the map. Our charge was to recapture our brand and speak to our customers more directly and forcefully than ever before. I firmly believe we're doing just that. So let's again pull out our E*TRADE to do this and etch a big, fat check mark next to the second key area of focus.","Our third and final key area of focus is our commitment to improve the customer experience. Frankly this work will never be complete. So I won't give this one a check mark but simply say I could not be prouder of the teams work in this important area. This past quarter we delivered host of enhancements from the exciting to the mundane but all focused on serving our customers better.","So for a few of the highlights from this quarter, we launched the securities based lending product delivering another avenue for customers to utilize their portfolios and E*TRADE to achieve their financial goals. We made enhancements throughout our investing offerings launching a new managed account dashboard and refreshing our managed account pages making them easier, more intuitive, and more useful.","It's evident that we are fostering real growth against our $6 billion managed asset goal through the enhancements we're making here. And lastly we took some initial steps in our concerted push into futures trading, releasing capabilities across some of our platforms. There will be much more to share on this front over the next two quarters as we expand the availability of futures across our platforms and meaningfully enhance the experience from where it stands today.","We were also pleased to be showcased during Apple's announcement of the new iPhone 10 and look forward to incorporating their technology to make a seamless and secure experience for our customers.","As for the housekeeping enhancements we made, which, while certainly less adorn than our shinier initiatives are no less important. We transformed our document upload process. This sounds a bit boring but it's actually a top driver of customer feedback, enhancing this process has removed one of our key customer dissatisfiers. We also improved our online application process to more seamlessly verify customer information while expanding the information and functionality for IRA's.","Translation, we're making it easier to become an E*TRADE customer and that\u2019s certainly a good thing. As for our metrics, our customers remain highly engaged with the markets this past quarter, generating DARTs of 206,000 down just slightly from last quarter's record levels but still on pace for our strongest year ever in trading. Our mix of derivatives trades also held strong at 32% for the quarter.","One important element within our customer trading is the price point at which it is taking place and why? When we initially struck the bifurcated pricing schedule defined by our 695 standard rate and our 495 active trader tier, we reasoned that by lowering the qualification threshold from 150 to just 30 trades a quarter for the discounted offering, we could assist less active customers in engaging a little more meaningfully to realize a better value proposition. This has indeed proven to be the case and we have noted an increase in trading by customers to meet the qualification for lower pricing.","While this migration was a large driver behind the dilution of commission for trade, this is a trend we can certainly live with, as we're capturing more volume from our existing customers and our value is clearly resonating. We're excited to see what more we can accomplish as our Power E*TRADE campaign takes flight.","To continue, we ended Q3 with customer margin balances at a record $8.5 billion. Net new brokerage assets of $2.2 billion brought our year-to-date growth rate to a healthy 4.4% a full 100 basis points higher than the same period last year and well on our way to reaching our targeted rate.","Managed assets ended the quarter at $4.9 billion, an increase of 32% from last year more than double the growth of the equity markets. We added 26,000 net new brokerage accounts for our strongest Q3 ever bringing us to 126,000 year-to-date which is more than 60% higher than the same period last year and reflects a year-to-date growth rate of 4.8% within our targeted range.","In terms of October activity through yesterday DARTs for the month were trending at around 206,000 flat with Q3 levels and customer margin balances have come in slightly to around $8.3 billion.","As I discussed last quarter, our corporate services channel continues to be a strategically important driver of retail brokerage accounts, assets, and cash and by adding new business to this pipeline, we essentially increased on metabolism from within and we amplified our focus on growing new business as the market is presenting a significant opportunity for leading offering like ours to win share. Our third quarter proved fruitful in this reinvigorated pursuit.","For the sixth year in a row our equity compensation administration platform, Equity Edge Online was rated number one in overall satisfaction and loyalty by Group Five. This year we were also rated highest in overall satisfaction for brokerage services, these are welcome accolades and serve as a testament to how tirelessly we work to arm our clients with forward thinking technology and support. We also made a splash in the wake of some turbulence in competitor offerings and were able to win some serious business.","As noted, landing 22 new participant companies representing $8 billion in stock plan assets across more than 110,000 new participants, this is in addition to the $4 billion in new stock plan assets implemented year-to-date which is a 60% increase from the same period last year and represents 20,000 new participants now enjoying our service. Let's keep in mind though this is a very long lead business with many implementations taking a year or more to complete.","For those in our current implementation pipeline, we expect to have them on our platform within the next six quarters. Further all indications point to more interest and more agreements on the horizon and I look forward to sharing more as these come to fruition.","We're very encouraged by these trends and our intensely focused on building out a fulsome offering that caters to the specific needs of high net worth investors who come to us through corporate services, we're approaching this challenge from several angles.","In addition to the acquisition we announced today, we're also exploring other ways to serve these participants, including the rollout of the tailored cash product as well as the securities based lending offering I mentioned earlier, which will provide another tool for participants to capitalize on the value of their stock plans. We are also piloting a referral program with a prestigious private bank to offer services to the senior executives of our participant companies.","Now before Mike takes you through our results and capital, I wanted to touch on some promotions within our management ranks during the quarter. As we welcome two internal stars to the executive leadership team, appointing Lea Stendahl as CMO and Lance Braunstein as CIO. Lea is an E*TRADE veteran and marketing maven with a heavy hand in some of E*TRADE's most successful and memorable campaigns throughout our history. She recently returned home following a three-year stint with the competition and on the heels of the phenomenally successful brand launch and a reinvigorated marketing department, we have elevated her title to match the scope of her responsibilities.","As for Lance, in addition to adding a brokerage industry leader in Mike Curcio, and best-in-class derivative trading capabilities, one of the things that excited us most about OptionsHouse was their approach to Tech\/Dev under Lance's leadership specifically in their delivery of cutting edge trading technology and user experiences on much leaner resources. Lance has been running our Tech\/Dev since we closed the acquisition and his fresh perspective has pushed us to work faster and smarter reigniting our innovative spirit.","To further stoke these fires I've placed all of our technology efforts under Lance and I move the role to report directly to me to ensure our delivery receives all the attention it needs, we are after all a Tech company.","Bottom-line, as I wrap up these opening remarks, it was yet another blockbuster quarter, we're in a period of the company's history where home runs are frequent and high performance is business as usual. Frankly this makes my job a heck of a lot of fun and I'm excited by what more we will be able to share with you along the way in continuing to deliver value for our customers and for our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it over to our CFO Mike Pizzi.","Michael Pizzi","Thanks, Karl. For the quarter, we posted net income of $147 million or $0.49 per share which includes a handful of notable items that had the net impact of reducing results by $0.06. Overall it was another quarter of solid results across the board as our business maintained strong momentum and trading volume and margin balances. We onboarded deposits to grow the balance sheet closer to our year-end target benefited from the full quarter impact of the June Fed hike and maintained prudent control over expenses.","As for the notable items, first, we recorded a $58 million loss related to the early extinguishment of debt associated with the refinancing in mid-August when we issued $1 billion of 5 and 10-year senior notes at a weighted average coupon of 3.3% replacing an equivalent amount at a 5% average rate. This reduces our annual interest expense by approximately $17 million.","Second, we recorded approximately $11 million in costs related to the OptionsHouse integration as well as the regulatory build-out related to crossing the $50 billion threshold. As Karl mentioned this quarter marked the final step of the OptionsHouse integration and this will be the last time we discuss costs associated with that deal.","Partially offsetting these negative items was a $29 million benefit to provision for loan losses. The portfolio outperformed our assumptions and we had net recoveries during that period which together drove the provision benefit. The allowance for loan losses ended the quarter at $94 million.","And finally, our effective tax rate for the quarter included an $8 million income tax benefit to the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets. This revaluation typically occurs during the third quarter and excluding this benefit our rate was closer to 38%. We expect the full year 2017 tax rate of approximately 37% and a full year 2018 tax rate in the mid 38% range. We expect to see quarterly volatility in our tax rate going forward due to these revaluations and the impact of share based compensation awards.","Now let's move on to the core results. Net revenue of $599 million was up $22 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by an increase of $35 million in net interest income as we grew average interest earning assets by $2.9 billion and net interest margin expanded 11 basis points to 285. This was better than our forecast as we refinanced our corporate debt, were opportunistic in our timing of securities purchases, grew customer margin balances to record levels, and securities lending came in strong.","For the fourth quarter we are assuming net interest margin in the low to mid 280s assuming margin balances remain at their current levels and we reinvest in securities in the 240 to 260 basis point range consistent with current market levels.","Commissions of $100 million declined $5 million from the second quarter, while overall DARTs moderated slightly average commission per trade declined by $0.26 to $7.76 on the dynamics Karl discussed earlier of higher pricing tier customers qualifying for a lower pricing tier as well as lower overall stock plan trades in the period which is consistent with seasonal trends.","Including these variables and assuming the successful adoption of futures trading over the course of the next few quarters, we expect CPT will decline additionally from today's levels to the low 760s going forward on average.","Fees and service charges declined by $6 million largely attributable to the shift of third-party cash to our balance sheet. One housekeeping note, we are now providing the detailed breakdown of this line item in the press release, in addition to the 10-Q where it has been included for some time so go ahead and add that to your list of enhancements to the analyst experience we're here to please.","Excluding the charge for the early extinguishment of debt, non-interest expense was $347 million in the quarter placing our adjusted operating margin at 42% which excludes the provision benefit but includes the $11 million in costs related to the OptionsHouse integration and crossing the $50 billion threshold. This marks the final installment of the OptionsHouse implementation costs and we expect $50 billion related cost to be around $3 million next quarter and $10 million over the course of 2018. Given the relative size of these remaining costs, we do not plan to continue breaking them out.","With respect to full year adjusted operating margin, we previously guided towards 39% including an expectation for Q3 to be in line with the second quarter level of around 38%. While we grew the balance sheet as planned customer margin growth and overall NIM outperformed and customer volumes came in strong. Additionally we shifted some planned investments to Q4 and added to our marketing spend to coincide with the launch of Power E*TRADE. For Q4 we are expecting our adjusted operating margin to be 40% which includes total marketing expense in the $45 million to $50 million range. We will cover our views on next year's adjusted operating margin in my closing remarks.","With respect to capital, we repurchased $187 million or 4.6 million shares at an average price of $40.64 on track to complete the $1 billion program by the end of 2018. On balance sheet growth we continue to plan to end the year at $63 billion. Given current off balance sheet deposits of around $7 billion with more than $3 million available for the onboarded, we have the ability to grow to around $64 billion if we were to deploy all available deposits today. Beyond 2017, you've seen that our balance sheet will scale in line with customer deposits.","As for corporate cash we ended the quarter at $309 million, down $160 million sequentially driven by repurchase activity and the debt refi. This was offset by $100 million distribution during the quarter to the parent from the broker dealer. For Q4 we expect this distribution to be $125 million.","With respect to the acquisition of TCA for the full year 2018, we expect the deal to be neutral to our bottom-line results, inclusive of the cost of the preferred stock we plan to issue to fund the transaction. For 2019, we expect $0.02 of earnings accretion with an IRR of approximately 20%. This assumes only modest expense synergy as TCA will continue to operate as a standalone platform. Additionally we would expect an acceleration of their growth and their assets under custody driven by the extension of our brand against the platform and capabilities. When full synergies are achieved in 2019 we expect TCA to contribute approximately $80 million in revenue and be slightly accretive to our overall operating margins.","Finally, while it should go without saying that acquisition does not alter our share repurchase program and doesn't have any bearing or our short-term growth targets but it unlocks the potential for significant long-term growth.","Now turning to expenses and our outlook for next year. As we enter the final stages of our budgeting process, we have developed an informed view of our outlook for 2018 and are targeting an adjusted operating margin for the full year of 42%. This assumes no increase in the Fed benchmark rate from current levels, includes the impact of the TCA acquisition, and incorporates our plans to increase investments in the business over the course of the year including a ramp up in marketing spends and other areas we believe will enhance our growth. If the Fed work to raise rates in December as is widely anticipated we believe we can achieve 43% op margin for next year. Hitting these targets will not be easy and will require discipline on how we manage the business and our investments but we are steadfast in our approach to deliver on these goals.","And with that, operator, we'll open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions].","And our first question is from the line of Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Rich Repetto","Good evening Karl. Good evening Mike and congrats on the TCA acquisition. I guess, the question, Mike, if I heard you properly that in 2018 you're expecting $80 million in revenue from TCA it looks like the last 12 months run rate was $50 million. So I'm just trying to understand are my numbers correct a little background on the synergies if I am correct and then what are the margins right now at TCA?","Michael Pizzi","Yes, on the fully synergized so it's 2019 is the year for $80 million in revenue. Next year it's a little going to be half year on the close. We expect margins to build in line we think it's -- it's not -- it\u2019s in the operating margin guidance we gave for next year of 42% based on a Q2 close. We think when fully synergized it'll be modestly accretive to our overall operating margin.","Rich Repetto","Okay. And then my one follow-up Karl we talked a lot about the trade average commission and the movement of people down to the lower rate and I'm just trying to understand I guess. Did you find it -- is that accretive -- did you find it accretive that this the trades made up for the lower commission in this quarter or is this something that will happen going forward you expect.","Michael Pizzi","We've been seeing the effect since the pricing change now is it existing customers feeling things like they add a few more trades to the mix or is it a customer who is trading at a multiple different accounts across companies that\u2019s pushing more to us. It's accretive, it\u2019s a positive impact our customers are engaging more with us and doing more and giving us more activity so overall we think it's a great outcome.","Karl Roessner","And the big thing for me Rich when I look at this and Mike is exactly right. We're just about to roll our Power E*TRADE campaign and what this demonstrates for us and gives us some early anecdotal evidence is that the value prop that we're putting out there is the right one. There are people interested in engaging with their finances through us in derivatives particularly at this price point with the service team that we have available to them on our platform. And so it's early good results in my view.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Steven Chubak","So I wanted to start off with the question on payment for order flow, it's certainly a topic that's being garnering a lot of focus since the October Treasury report and a lot of investors seem to be going through this exercise of order flow gain theory, so trying to anticipate how you might respond if a large competitor chose to potentially rebate order flow fees back to their clients and so when you give us some insight into whether you view this type of response as analogous to what we saw in February with the commission price cuts which ultimately prompted you and some of your peers to respond with similar actions or are the considerations around order flow bit different in your view?","Karl Roessner","Yes look Steven and people have talked about order flow and payment order flow and routing and how market structure fits in and what are we going to do in this space and there must be a change there's money here, there's money there. The way I look at it our investors and the folks who invest with us and the folks who interact with our transactions have never received better execution quality than they're receiving right now both in terms of speed, in terms of what they get back when we do price improvement for them, it's a very strong dynamic right now.","So looking at payment for order flow in a bucket where should you repaid it or should you do different things, in my view you'd be in this parlance you'd be mill wise and pound foolish to take away some of the payment that comes in to us, a lot of what we do with that and a lot of what we look at are further improvements to our site, further improvements into the trading experience.","So that's one of the things that allows us to continue at the price points that we do and drive the kind of value prop that we do for our folks who interact with us for our customers. So I don't -- I don't see this as the same thing in terms of price pressure, price competition. Obviously we've said this before and we'll stand by it again, we'll do whatever it takes to defend our book, so anything like this were to go on or there were to be changes that take place, we'd evaluate them in the same vein and take a look at how they're going to impact our customers. Is it going to cause people to go and move elsewhere, I strongly doubt it, right we still haven't seen the dislocation from the price cuts and those were called lot bigger deal than something like this. So I don't -- I don't see it coming that way but we will obviously continue to evaluate it but the way I look at it the value proposition that we have right now is unlike any that we've seen in the history of trading.","Steven Chubak","Got it. And maybe a question Mike for you on deposit beta, your deposit costs have stayed remarkably low despite some recent increases that we've seen at some of your retail brokerage peers. As we think about the deposit price competition from here, do you feel any pressure to potentially stay competitive with some of the large E-brokers or because they have a much larger RIA operation even after this latest deal where deposit tier -- deposit beta theory be higher is it reasonable to expect that you will continue to lag the peer set with future hikes?","Michael Pizzi","We've always thought of our deposits as rate insensitive. We modeled them that way and it shows its evidence in the beta and I would say that in this hike in cycle from the Fed that we\u2019ve been going through, they're even more insensitive than we modeled. Yes it\u2019s a concern for some customers and we do look at the competitive environment, we look at the set of products that we offer across various suite products and other cash management alternatives and really factor it into our assessment. But overall by and large, we\u2019re not seeing a large need to move deposit rates at this time.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.","Devin Ryan","Maybe a follow-up here on TCA and just kind of thought process obviously, it's a scale business some of the large custodians have hundreds of billions of assets some over trillion and I know you understand that it's a scale business, so I\u2019m just kind of think about when you're looking to purchase this business, how it's really differentiated and when you look at the technology that you referenced, is there overlap of what's being offered at some of the other custodians or do you feel like that there's a big point of differentiation there?","Karl Roessner","We expect like some of these ability on their platform in the way that it's rolled out there, the customer set both on the RIA themselves and then to the end user and the availability on mobile and the way that they can track and plug-in in the open architecture. I think they do have a differentiated offering. We\u2019re well aware that this is a scale business, when we look at TCA we see a couple different things. One is obviously the ability to diversify our revenue streams and bring additional into us for a channel that we haven't played in it is a custody platform for us.","The second thing is putting our marketing and branding behind this to help them grow and go out and garner additional assets. One of the most important things that that we look out and we talked about strategically both the board and management team first and with the board was giving us additional tools and an additional avenue to really go out and work on our stock plan participants base, a lot of the assets that leave us through that channel do indeed go either to bulge bracket firms or to RIA channel and it is something that we think we can use to harvest additional share of wallet and continue to keep more of those assets on us. So that's the way we look at it just holistically looking at this deal.","Devin Ryan","Got it, okay. That's helpful and just follow-up here that you spoke about some of the competitive dynamics in the corporate stock plan business which you trace from benefiting from and I know that some of your competitors are outsourcing on the certain Fintech platforms, I'm assuming that was what you were referring to but do you have a sense of how long that window will be open as firms are kind of migrating and are you having more conversations around some of the migration where you feel like you can win some contracts away?","Karl Roessner","Look I think we're still in early days of the migration and moving on to those outsourced technology platforms. So we're just starting to see some of the early results and some of the deals that we announced actually most of those are not a result of dislocation, they're just the result of the stellar team that we've built around this and the guys who go out and work with these big corporates every day and satisfy their needs and Equity Edge Online provides a lot of functionality to these companies and we've been able to tailor it in a way that is extremely helpful.","And when you get into some of the bigger players in the space, you can grow quite quickly just in terms of being helpful with their HR departments helpful with their legal departments and moving from there, so you get a good reputation which we have a stellar one and you grow from there. So the dislocation I believe is still to come, we're starting to see some initial RFPs remember when they change the stock plan provider most of these companies will that's what it's doing when they go to their outsourced technology platform, so we get a shot at that and I like our chances in every one of them.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Conor Fitzgerald with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Conor Fitzgerald","Just on the TCA acquisition again can you just give us a breakdown of the $30 million of revenue synergies you talked about, is there anything kind of from a revenue uplift per dollar client assay, you think you can see versus some of maybe the growth you kind of talked about and then and on that just how will the advisor experience that TCA changed post the acquisition?","Michael Pizzi","You want to take that?","Karl Roessner","Yes, so I will take those the latter part of the question first and then I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mike. So the experience for the RIA will not change at all. This is going to be run as a separate unit, for us their senior management team which I'm quite impressed with will remain in place and we'll run it together. So there won't be a change to their overall experience. So Mike you want to go through the numbers.","Michael Pizzi","Sure. When you think about sort of synergies of a deal like this, first off you have synergies from just a general corporate type integration. So what I would consider finance functions like I run, the risk function and other areas where we can bring at scale operation to them. That\u2019s obviously a very modest amount of cost synergies but it is a factor in the deal.","When you look to the revenue side we expect our brand and say some modest investment in the business should be able to drive additional growth overall we think it's a capable technology platform that is differentiated in the space and roll out some degree of additional growth.","And then really like a third category, I would say is our relationships with vendors, our relationships with fund companies, asset managers where we think we can deliver, we can deliver overall better economics to them what they're earning on those relationships. Putting all those pieces together, you get to the fully synergized revenue. Now keep in mind you took the last 12 months from the Investor Deck and you took the number we gave in the prepared remarks and said that the synergies there is a level of baseline organic growth, they have been growing. So it's not entirely correct to call that number to synergies.","Conor Fitzgerald","No, that's helpful. Thank you and then appreciate the expense outlook for 2018 just I'm trying to think through some of the moving pieces you had a really strong expenses one quarter 44% core pre-tax margin. When you're thinking about the setting 42% target for next year can you just give us a sense of how much will be kind of investment in the business versus if revenues come in better in some of the strong trends we've seen on trading continue what that upside scenario could look like?","Michael Pizzi","Well, I mean I think the key investment that we call out really and you can see it in the plan really going into Q4 from Q3. Q3 is a period of time where we didn't spend as much on marketing simply because there is generally a quieter time so we shifted some of that into Q4 of this year. So similarly for next year with the launch of Power E*TRADE, with the now fully integrated OptionsHouse platform, with our investments in a more capable futures platform and everything that we're doing correspondingly we're up -- we're up in marketing again. That's really one of the key drivers but we are really looking through and continuing to apply discipline other areas of expenses so that overall we can deliver a pretty compelling operating margin of 42% for the year and that's really without the Federal Reserve action -- any action from the Federal Reserve in December. With the Fed moving 43% and a good market backdrop like we've been having we think 43% is very achievable.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. ","Brennan Hawken","Hey, good evening thanks for taking the questions. One quick one on the -- the commission indication I think you said that you expected to go to the low 760s going forward but does that include what you expect will be the impact of Power E*TRADE or is that for that?","Michael Pizzi","That includes the impact of the launch of Power E*TRADE additional customers coming on from that in the 495 type level that\u2019s really a forecasted level and I think also it\u2019s in the remarks but I'll reiterate it, it also -- it considers a build in our futures trading at $1.50 that does drag on the number as well but we think that's a very compelling price point to be putting out there in that market.","Brennan Hawken","Terrific, thank you. And then one more on TCA when we think about this and your comments with how it fits in with the wealth management opportunity and the tie in with your corporate stock plan is that tied to previous comments I believe you've indicated in the past that you're looking more to target the middle management layers for your corporate stock plan customers or does the acquisition of TCA lead you to adjust those aspirations at this point?","Karl Roessner","So I think that's the way -- the way I look at stock plan and when we talk about this a bit, right now before we talk about what we're onboarding and how well we've been doing in that space it's about $1.5 million planned participants who are on us that have an event taking place, whether it be a restricted stock grant option or performance share unit or something in there pipeline with us.","So we're looking at the entire spectrum. I believe some of the comments we made in the past have been around their C-Suite the senior management folks and the Section 16 officers a lot of those folks are tied into some of the bulge bracket relationships that the companies have whether it be through the underwriting, underwriters and an IPO or other senior members so that is definitely an echelon that's a bit tougher to crack, and you need to be able to go after that segment with the right tools of the trade. So we talked a little bit about our initial sort of fledgling relationship that we're developing with a private bank to go in and offer additional services to that group and some of those folks in that tier and the tier down also move off of their own platforms and moved out of our platform and go to investment advisors right so.","And then the other folks in terms of education and the folks who would be more in the Main Street population as our customers it's really about driving them through education and providing the tools and services to let them interact with their finances seamlessly and very easily giving them technology that works for them getting to them early and providing them with -- with opportunities to understand how they can do better with their interact and with their finances.","So it's really the entire spectrum I don't think we're changing anything what we're trying to do is put as many tools in our arsenal as we possibly can to make sure that we don't lose any of those customers who we could otherwise keep if we have the service they were looking for out of that lane. So it's really raising E*TRADE's profile with that group of individuals so that they don't just look at it as a service provider but more as their stop when they want to deal with their finances.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. Another question on TCA I guess could you give us a sense of what the growth has been organically over the last couple of years. And then also if you could be more specific about kind of the growth assumptions you're kind of making as well as what market assumption you're making as you think about the growth -- the 2019 revenue target.","Michael Pizzi","Sure. I mean we think about sort of the level of growth we think that picking up, picking up a couple percentage points just we're making some modest investments and backing the platform with our brands is -- is readily achievable. Historically we've grown to about $17 billion in assets under custody they're about 180 total advisors again a very capable platform growing in the high-single-digit range.","Dan Fannon","And your assumption for the market over those next year-and-a-half, two years.","Michael Pizzi","We think that -- I think that's a consistent market environment for the one we've been in.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Chris Harris","Thanks guys. On the Power E*TRADE it sounds like you're comps that you're going to be picking up share there. So wondering if you guys could comment on what capabilities you think Power trade has or does a better job with than the competition.","Karl Roessner","Just to look back at where OptionsHouse sort of came from it and the growth that they were able to experience offering best-in-class platform out to their customers. Putting our brand behind that rolling out those tools and functionality out to a broader base including our existing E*TRADE population as well as those who are underserved in this marketplace we're extremely confident about the brand about the service platform that will go out with and also about our active trader sales team that is dedicated to this group and to this platform. So we very much like the market opportunity this brings to us.","Chris Harris","Okay, great. The other question I had was on your NIM and specifically the securities portfolio yields. We've been pleasantly surprised at how well that yield has hung in over the years and if we look at it now though it's still as a way of average yield higher than the 10-year treasury rate and so just not sure how that's possible given that I thought your portfolio duration will be much lower than that. Could you guys could maybe talk to us a bit about that dynamic and how that's stable.","Michael Pizzi","Yes, sure. Primarily we buy agency products so we're buying agency mortgages product typically in that sort of belly of the curve. I think if you look at sort of the type of yield that offers in that on sort of a duration match basis to our deposit liability that has allowed us really to invest in the type of marginal investment ranges over the course of this year. This right now in the market we think the right investment grade is going to be right around the mid-twos and you can compare that's kind of where overall asset yields are and that those yields are readily available on a variety of type of products that we invest in.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","Thanks guys. Just one more on TCA. On the revenues just wanted to get any color on I guess like the revenue and mix in terms of the only think about commissions versus fees on cash and obviously if you can grow that business you just over time, how that would may be diversify your earning stream?","Karl Roessner","Well right now they come us to with about $1.1 billion or so of customer cash that is going to be directly into our suite program on the closed date so that does give us overall available cash. Now because these are advisor relationships they hold less cash on average per account then what we have in our sort of retail brokerage accounts but it's going to scale really as they grow assets over time, in terms of the amount of cash that they provide. They have some other ancillary revenues but the rest of it comes from the fees they charge on the assets under custody.","Michael Carrier","Okay, thanks. And then second just as we get into 2018, Mike, if we end up getting further Fed hikes in addition to say one in December, how would that impact either the margin outlook or maybe the incremental investment spend like will most of that be coming to the bottom-line or are there investments on the horizon or in the backlog that if you do get more in terms of rate benefits that you would spend more accelerate some of the growth initiatives?","Karl Roessner","So look -- the way we look at this, if we get more rate hikes or there's additional revenue available we'll obviously drop as much as we can to the bottom-line but obviously the sort of all boats rise in the rising tide. So to the extent that we see additional competition which I would greatly expect you would see us investing more in our marketing dollars, you may see us investing more in the platform on the technology, we've been pretty clear in terms of the long-term earnings slide that we put out there and where we would be and how we handle this. We are a little bit conservative in those estimates, which I freely acknowledged. But I think there are a lot of things that we will need to be doing to keep up in a competitive landscape like that in a rising rate environment.","Michael Pizzi","Yes I mean I think the long-term earnings slide does a great job, if you think about 100 basis points parallel shift that and what could be achievable from that, we have it in a 46% operating margin that roughly implies almost 80% sort of flow through on the marginal economics of increases in rates. I guess what I would sort of the only thing I would put out there is sort of deposit betas which we've already sort of talked about in the call but we think that those assumptions in that slide do assume that we move our deposit rates with market. So to the extent, you think there is going to be outperformance, there could be or the orders catch up there maybe but we think that operating margin expansion is very possible not possible but highly likely with continued interest rate hikes overall and still allowing some of that to be invested into that business.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please go ahead.","Kyle Voigt","Hi good evening. Just one follow-up on the strategy with TCA. You already noted earlier that the RIA spaces, the custody spaces, the scale business just wondering as we get into 2018 and this deal closes, just trying to understand if you continue to look for other small bolt-on type deals in order to gain scale in that space?","Karl Roessner","So the way that we've talked about our inorganic strategy is we'll continue to look through the same lines that we've looked through for the use of our capital right what makes the most sense is it buying back, is it moving more onto our balance sheet maximizing that and monetizing the cash that\u2019s available to us. So that remains the same, the areas that we're interested in obviously remain the same if there's a scale play that would be available on the brokerage side and we'd definitely look to take a look at that opportunity, if there was something in the corporate services side which the business is very important to us to help us grow scale in that space.","And then as we look at TCA if we get the acquisition done in the middle of 2018, we'll look at where it is from a strategic perspective but we will continue to be the same stewards of capital that we've been during the past number of years now.","Kyle Voigt","Okay. And then just a follow-up just really on the additional preferred issuance. I'm just wondering if you can give an update on your desired capital structure. Really just get clean preferred and common, thanks.","Michael Pizzi","Yes I mean I think when we look at the overall sort of the amount of preferred, we have it's $400 million today, the size of this acquisition is $275 million and the current state of the preferred markets from a cost perspective which we think if we just look at the existing one that we have would probably put an issuance somewhere in the low 5% range. I think when you put all that backdrop together, it's pretty compelling but then from a capital structure standpoint, I think we start to limit out as we approach sort of 20% or so overall capital, this will move us up into the mid-teens.","We think it's the perfect vehicle for this acquisition but at some point it is limited -- it becomes limited but it has a very positive effect in the overall capital structure at these type of levels.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Campbell","Yes thanks. Yes just wanted to follow-up quickly on that last point, if you guys look ahead to next year post kind of TCA closure and doing more bolt-ons, again how do we if you're going to kind of sort of plateauing out on the preferred side, how do you think about kind of capital usage in that scenario? Or are you going to tap at that market there is a common issuance, what kind of mix will that be in the bolt-ons on a go forward?","Michael Pizzi","I think you sort of \u2013 you reach a point where you have essentially reached capacity from a capital perspective in terms of what you want from a capital structure and preferreds, I think then obviously we're generating a pretty considerable amount of free cash, we could have deployed that cash to this acquisition. We still would have had a pretty compelling overall return on invested capital if we did so. So that becomes the metric, it provides that sort of a discipline we look at every acquisition in terms of the use of capital, is it a compelling -- is it compelling return on that capital versus alterative use of share buybacks. So from a longer run perspective, we can continue to look at bolt-on largely supported by the cash flow that we're generating.","Jeremy Campbell","Got it. And then it seems like a lot of your initiatives are growing well and the TCA deal makes sense from a big picture kind of strategy sense was getting the RIA exposure, I know you guys kind of -- you run the business with the expectation you will stay independent going forward and the deal isn't that big but I'm just wondering does this deal at all kind of reduced the board\u2019s optionality and perhaps kind of preclude strategic alternatives like exploring a sale.","Karl Roessner","So what I would say is I can't speak for the entire board as they have potentially duties aligned with this whole routine but what I would say that it doesn't this deal is going to be run as a sort of separate standalone business. We will make sure that it is enveloped within our enterprise risk management structure which we are extremely proud of and we've built out quite well. So that will be sort of that the touch points into E*TRADE itself and we will put the brand behind that it will be run as relatively standalone. I do not believe that this transaction inhibits in any way the board's ability to do whatever they think is right as they exercise their view of our strategic future.","We laid out growth goals we've been reporting on those growth goals religiously to you all and to everybody else coming out. We pose them internally, we've used them as a mechanism to really align the organization from top to bottom and drive results and make sure that we are at an execution\/accountable culture to goals that we've set out to show both the board and the Street and our investors and everybody else that's interested in us that we can continue to grow organically.","So don't misinterpret this acquisition we think is strategically very good but we will continue to track to our growth goals which we fully expect to meet, but it's not going to first of all detract or distract this management team from what we've set out and have been very clear cut as the most important things to us and that is being the number one digital broker in the space to investors and advisors alike right known for ease of use and our functionality so, it's -- it is what we've laid out and I don't believe that this in any way changes anything that we've set forth.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Michael Cyprys","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to circle back to the stock plan business you mentioned some new wins there so just curious your perspective on what are some the aspects of your value proposition you think are most resonating with those clients driving to these new wins here they spoke about and as you look out into 2018 what are some of the objectives kind of the growth priorities that you have in the stock plan business.","Karl Roessner","Sure, well it's a great question. I love talking about this business so thank you. It's really -- it starts with a team that is focused on providing excellent service and a platform that works for the team that has to administer the plan within the organization, right it's not just looked at as a plug and play or a piece of software that you go out and sell to these folks and have them comment and try to adapt to it. They actually build and learn right. When we talked about OptionsHouse acquisition, we talked a lot about it's going back a ways but you know the first conference I did back away in September of 2016 was sort of working through what they bring to us in terms of agile. This is one of the businesses that we have run as an agile format from the entire time so our tech guys right our customer service guys, our product guys, the sales folks, the installation teams they all work with the customer or the prospect to make sure they understand what they want and they build it out for them.","Right, we are very user friendly in this space it has to be a high touch space because there are human beings on the other end dealing with real life problems. So it really starts with that it's a focus on the business to focus on what can we do to help serve this corporate to make sure that their HR department, their legal department has a stress free existence with an Equity Edge online but that's our job every day.","So, that's why I talk about wins and what we can do and where we can go with this because I know the teams on the ground and I know who they're competing with right if you look around in this marketplace I am quite comfortable that our team can outdo anybody out there as long as they've given the opportunity and the chance and we have the bandwidth to take on the customers we're looking at. That sort of where -- where we are right now so I like the prospects for this business I like their opportunities given the dislocation in the marketplace and if we had another hour I could keep going.","Michael Cyprys","Okay, and just one thing, last follow-up on a point you made earlier about making it easier to become an E*TRADE customer with some of the improvements what do you stand on that today versus where you'd like to be along that spectrum and maybe if you could just talk a little bit about what's left on your to do list as you look out over the next 12 to 18 months there.","Karl Roessner","So on our -- on our customer dissatisfiers, right, we have a running list of those and those are generated from right out of our call centers and right out of the folks who are on the help lines and dealing with customer service on the front line. So it's a constant evolving list some of the things you heard me talk about in prepared remarks were just something as easy as uploading documents or fixing our online application to make sure that it is extremely intuitive and easy to use.","Right helping find information from -- for customers or helping them populate the fields more easily so that their experience with E*TRADE from day, minute one is pain free right, that's what we strive for.","As I said in the prepared remarks this is not one I can ever give a check mark to, it is a constant work in process. Somebody will always have a better touch points something nicer out there, a better look and feel. We have teams of people internally working on this every day to make sure our customers get the best from us in every interaction they have with us from our prospects site all the way through to their first login, to their first ACH or the money that comes in from whatever source they're going to use to make sure that that's seamless that\u2019s the way you keep customers, you keep them happy from their first interaction with you so, that's why we continue to drive that and you will see more and I will never put a check mark on this one because I'll never be satisfied but we need to continue to improve every day.","Operator","And at this time, we have no further questions in queue. I will now turn it over to you Mr. Roessner.","Karl Roessner","Well, thank you all for joining and we will speak with you next quarter, if not sooner.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude your conference call for today.

No other recordings or copies of this call are authorized or may be relied upon.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Frank Petrilli. Please go ahead, sir.","Frank J. Petrilli","Good evening. Good evening, and thank you for joining today's call. I've now served in the role of Interim CEO for a little over 2 months and have spent nearly 9 months as Chairman of the Board. During this time, I've come to learn and appreciate a great deal about this firm and its management, and my confidence has never been higher that executing on the strategic plan outlined earlier this year is the right path toward creating shareholder value.","Despite our disappointing bottom line results, we have made meaningful progress on our plan and put in place several key building blocks to drive future execution of our strategy. Matt will take you through the financial results and many of the specifics you may be interested in, but I would first like to walk you through what I consider to be the most important areas of focus and our progress against them.","When I assumed the role of interim CEO in August, I committed to the board that I would place unwavering focus on 4 key elements of our strategy, which fit neatly within the company's overall strategic and capital plan that we presented to our regulators in June. My key areas of focus are as follows:","First, expand the brokerage business. Now this has been at the heart of everything the company has been doing for quite some time, but it is especially important today as we cannot lose focus of our overarching purpose marked by our goals to expand market share and to increase penetration of our existing customers' assets.","Second, strengthen the financial position of the company. This speaks to both the balance sheet and the income statement and will always be a focus, but is particularly important today, given the meaningful value that can be unlocked through the execution of our strategic plan.","Third, focus on cost reductions and efficiencies. This obviously ties in directly with the second area I just discussed, but it is a heightened area of focus, not only while I am at the helm, but also going forward.","And fourth, build out our enterprise risk management framework to be appropriate for our size and complexity, mindful of the current regulatory environment.","I will now take you through our progress on each of these areas of focus.","With respect to expanding the brokerage business, despite less than favorable market conditions this quarter, we were still able to bring in net new brokerage assets of $1.9 billion. DARTs of 129,000 in the third quarter were down 22% versus the year-ago quarter, reflective of both disengagement on the part of the retail investor and a normalization versus the year-ago period when volatility was at a multi-year high surrounding the U.S. debt downgrade.","In October, customer trading has continued to decline. As of this afternoon, in fact, DARTs are down 13% from September and 7% from third quarter levels. While trade volumes exhibited the seasonal slowness the industry has come to expect from the third quarter, the mix of our trades actually saw improvement over the period as options trades represented more than 25% of total DARTs. This continues to be an important area of growth for us not only because options trades have a higher associated level of commissioned and cash equities, but they typically set the stage for additional transactions due to their fixed expiration dates. And what customers appreciate most about options is the ability to generate income or protect positions in any kind of market.","Also relating to trading, our principal transaction revenue was up this quarter in the face of a declining customer trading as our market-making operations saw an increase in order flow from external parties and some benefit from disruptions amongst peers during the quarter. Net new brokerage accounts of 18,000 bring our year-to-date total to 110,000, already above the 99,000 that we acquired during the full year of 2011. Very importantly, we are also keeping more of our brokerage accounts as evidenced by vastly improved account retention over the past few years. This quarter marks our second best ever with respect to brokerage account attrition.","Our annualized rate of 8.5% is up just slightly from the firm record, 8.4%, we saw in the second quarter and 200 basis points better than our levels a year ago. This is such a critically important statistic for us since it encapsulates all that we are doing to drive customer satisfaction for the future profitable growth of our franchise.","Growing our retirement and investing offering is core to our strategy of expanding the brokerage business not only because it builds upon a less volatile source of annuitized revenue, but it importantly serves as a pathway to deepen engagement with existing customers, thereby driving quality asset growth.","We currently estimate we hold 12% of our customers' investable assets on average. We view this as a meaningful opportunity to leverage our most valuable asset, which is our current customer base, for future growth. While we have long offered a suite of retirement and investing products and services, we have been enhancing it and turning our marketing attention toward repositioning the brand as a trusted destination for retirement assets, managed investment solutions and advice.","Part and parcel is our focus on our team of financial consultants, which we've grown by about 40% in just under 2 years, currently standing at over 270 professionals. These financial consultants were responsible for approximately 1\/3 of our net new assets during the quarter and our bringing on accounts which are 6x greater in size than our traditional channels bring us. This represents an average account size of approximately $140,000, more than double the $60,000 in average account size across all brokerage accounts. Additionally, financial consultants have been crucial to growing our managed assets, which have now crossed the $1 billion mark after less than 3 years since the products were introduced. We are building momentum for sustained growth in this arena.","Within this key strategic pillar of growing the brokerage business is our goal of enhancing the retail trading offering. To that end, we continue to launch new products and services this quarter and received some valued recognition related to our existing offerings and service levels. Our recently launched one-stop rollover simplifies the process for individuals to move their 401(k) savings into a professionally managed portfolio at E*TRADE. With an account minimum of just $25,000, we are offering professionally managed solutions to a population of underserved individuals. Validated by our proprietary surveys, this product fills an important need in the marketplace, as well as in the retirement accounts of our existing and prospective customers.","Our mobile offering continues to be an important part of our strategy, and we recently launched our sixth E*TRADE mobile application designed for a Windows phone. Mobile adoption rates among our customer base continued to grow as 6.7% of our trades were executed via these devices during the third quarter, up from 4.8% a year ago.","Product enhancements, new offerings and the commitment to customer service reflect our mission to deliver the best investing experience, period. This mission resonates throughout our company and, as a testament to our employees' hard work, we were recently awarded the #1 ranking in Kiplinger's annual Best of the Online Broker survey. We were also the only firm to receive 5-star ratings in both the customer service and investment choices categories.","In addition, our Corporate Services group received external validation of its success. For the third consecutive year, our equity hedge platforms were top rated in overall satisfaction, reporting and technology by Group Five's Annual Stock Plan Administration Study, which gauges the overall satisfaction of stock plan sponsors in the United States.","Moving on to our next area of strategic focus, strengthening the financial position of the company. For the third quarter, we posted a disappointing loss of $0.10 per share on revenue of $490 million. The quarter's results contained some notable charges, including $50 million in increased provision related to new data on borrower bankruptcies and $13 million of severance for our prior CEO. Matt will take you through these items in more detail.","Within this key area of focus, our main objectives are to improve our capital ratios with a goal of deploying bank capital to the parent to pay off high-cost debt and to continue to improve the level and quality of our earnings as our legacy costs reduce over time.","This quarter we made headway in terms of both our deleveraging efforts, which we view to be the best path forward for improving our capital ratios, as well as our dialogue with the regulators. Matt will share the details, but at the highest level, we have identified over $4 billion of deleveraging, including $1.3 billion completed during the third quarter and over $3 billion, which we have targeted for the fourth quarter. As for our de-risking efforts, we continue to reduce the balance sheet risk with a shrinking legacy loan portfolio. The average age of these loans is now in excess of 6.5 years, and the loan portfolio continues to become less of an overhang for this company each day.","Our third area of focus relates to cost reductions and efficiencies. Last quarter, our leadership team communicated a target of cutting $50 million from our run rate expenses by the end of 2013, with the goal of implementing the majority within 12 months. We spent this quarter working diligently to identify additional reductions and more importantly, to drive efficiencies in how we do business. I'm proud to report that the team has built upon their initial target and arrived at $70 million of reductions already identified, with a new target of $100 million in reductions from run rate expenses by the end of 2013. Beyond setting and hitting our targets and central to this exercise is the philosophical change to continually drive process improvement through efficiency gains at every level of our organization.","I feel good about our progress here not only as the environment demands this type of introspective review but because it is the right thing to do for our business and for our shareholders. I have personally spoken to many groups of employees about the importance of this ongoing focus, and I am delighted with their professionalism and commitment to deliver.","My last key area of focus relates to the build out of our enterprise risk management framework to create a structure that is appropriate for our size and complexity. While managing risk has always been a central focus, we are dedicating additional resources and time and energy to formalizing and expanding this function.","Given the enhanced regulatory environment and the updated guidelines under our new regulators, the time is appropriate for us to accelerate our focus in this area. While risk management is the responsibility of every employee at E*TRADE, it really starts with the appropriate tone at the top, which, I believe, we have set through internal communications and focused actions.","We are enhancing our risk management structure to focus on specific areas. For example, operational risk management, capital planning and regulatory relations. We are bolstering areas like vendor management and stress testing to highlight a few of the many areas impacted by this focus.","As we mentioned previously, we expect this ongoing investment to total approximately $10 million, which includes systems upgrades and headcount as we hire additional risk management staff, compliance personnel and auditors.","With that, I'll hand the call over to Matt to walk you through the financial results.","Matthew J. Audette","Thank you, Frank. For the third quarter, we reported a net loss of $29 million or $0.10 per share. This included 2 unique items: first, provision included $50 million related to new data on borrower bankruptcies acquired by the company; and second, compensation included $13 million related to the departure of our former CEO. Taken together, these 2 items reduced our third quarter results by $0.13 per share.","Our third quarter net revenues were $490 million, inclusive of deleveraging-related securities gains. With these gains, revenues were up from $452 million in the second quarter and down from $507 million in the third quarter of 2011.","Revenues included net interest income of $261 million, a sequential decline of $18 million, driven by a 16-basis-point decline in net interest spread on a relatively flat average balance sheet. Net interest spread fell at 228 basis points for the quarter. The predominant factors which negatively impacted spread this quarter were loan paydowns, continued pressure on reinvestment rates, driven by the overall low rate environment and an increase in cash as loan paydowns and securities proceeds were not fully reinvested in anticipation of deleveraging actions in Q4.","We now expect our spread for the full year 2012 will average slightly below 240 basis points. All else equal, we continue to expect another 10 basis points of compression in 2013 from 2012 full year levels.","Commissions, fees and service charges, principal transactions and other revenue in the third quarter were $153 million, down 1% from the second quarter and down 15% from the same quarter of 2011.","Average commission per trade was $11.24, up from $10.68 last quarter as a result of favorable product mix. Year-over-year, average commission per trade was up from $10.76. Revenue this quarter also included $79 million of net gains on loans and securities, inclusive of deleveraging-related gains as we sold securities to match a reduction of certain wholesale funding obligations.","Our legacy loan portfolio ended the quarter at $11.1 billion, a contraction of $616 million during the quarter and is now down 66% from its size at the peak. We now expect that loan runoff will average approximately $500 million per quarter for the next several quarters.","Provision for loan losses for the quarter was $141 million, up from $67 million in the prior quarter. This quarter's provision included $50 million related to charge-offs associated with newly identified bankruptcy filings.","We utilize third-party servicers to obtain bankruptcy data specific to our loan portfolio. And during the third quarter, we identified an increase in bankruptcies reported by one specific servicer. In researching this increase, we discovered that the servicer had not been reporting all prior bankruptcy data on a timely basis. As a result of the servicer shortfall, we implemented an enhanced procedure around all servicer reporting to corroborate the bankruptcy reporting with independent third-party data. Through this additional process, approximately $90 million of loans were identified in which the servicers failed to report the bankruptcy filing to us.","Our long-standing policy is to write down loans at our collateral value when notified that a borrower is in the process bankruptcy. Therefore, these loans were written down during the third quarter, which resulted in an increase to the provision for loan losses of $50 million. Approximately 90% of the loans written down as a result of this exercise are performing, current loans. We also noted these additional charge-offs were not as a result of the recently issued regulatory guidance on the treatment of discharged bankruptcies.","Excluding the effect of the additional charge-offs, provision increased $24 million from the prior quarter to $91 million. This sequential increase was due primarily to a decline of $16 million in put-back settlements with third-party mortgage originators.","Total net charge-offs in the quarter were $158 million. Excluding charge-offs related to the review of servicer data on bankruptcies, net charge-offs would have been $109 million, down from the $121 million in the prior quarter.","Delinquency performance across the portfolio trended positively, and the 30- to 89-day delinquent category improved 6% sequentially and 29% from a year ago. Total at-risk delinquencies, or the 30- to 179-day delinquent category, improved 7% in the period and 29% from a year ago.","The total allowance for loan losses ended the quarter at $508 million, a sequential decline of $17 million. The $508 million reserve consists of $191 million for modified loans and $276 million for non-modified loans. In addition, we maintained a qualitative reserve to account for factors not directly contemplated in our loss model. This reserve stood at $41 million, or 15% of the general reserve, as of quarter end.","Our coverage remains relatively constant for non-modified loans, with this quarter's allowance covering 72% of 90-plus days past due loans. This compares to the 67% last quarter.","For modified loans, we have increased our total expected losses to 37% from 36% last quarter and increased our allowance accordingly. Our allowance of $191 million for modified loans plus prior write downs continues to cover the total expected losses in this portfolio. We modified $54 million of loans during the quarter, down from $94 million last quarter. We continue to expect quarterly modification volumes to trend downward as the population of delinquent loans continues to decline.","Turning to progress with our regulators on our capital plan. One of our top goals is to distribute capital from the bank to the parent in order to pay off high-cost debt. A gating factor to accomplishing this goal is our banking regulators' comfort with our most constraining capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage. Accordingly, we are focused on improving this ratio through organic capital generation and by reducing the size of our balance sheet.","With this goal in mind, we developed a comprehensive, strategic and capital plan, which was submitted to our banking regulators in late June. The plan outlined assumptions for capital level and distributions under various operating conditions and included a holistic forecast of our business and results over the next 5 years. Included in this capital plan and forecast is our assumption that we will be in a place to start distributing bank capital to the parent by the end of 2013.","During the third quarter, we received initial feedback from the OCC and the Federal Reserve on the plan, and we maintain an active and ongoing dialogue to ensure our execution of the plan is consistent with their expectations. Based on their feedback, we are confident that the key elements of our strategic plan, specifically de-risking, deleveraging and the build out of our enterprise risk management function are critical. And assuming the successful execution of these key elements, we are confident that our targets for bank capital levels and corresponding distributions of capital will be achievable over time.","Our plan includes a target ratio for bank Tier 1 leverage of 9.5%, intended to align with the ratios of other large banks, which currently have leverage ratios within the 9% to 10% range. This threshold far exceeds the current well-capitalized minimum of 5%, and we believe it's within reach, given our current leverage ratio at 7.9%.","We plan to achieve this target ratio by generating capital through earnings and by deleveraging the balance sheet. We expect this target leverage ratio to decline over time as we improve our credit and risk profile, earnings stability and build out a top-tier enterprise risk management program. We plan to reduce the current target threshold of 9.5% by 50 basis points each year, beginning in 2014, ultimately settling at 8%. And most importantly, our plan includes quarterly distributions from the bank to the parent of capital in excess of our target thresholds beginning by the end of 2013.","While we believe our capital plan is achievable, it is important to note that any capital distributions would be subject to the approval of our banking regulators at the time of the request and could be influenced by factors not currently contemplated in our plan. In addition, I would highlight that while Tier 1 leverage is currently our most constraining ratio, all required capital measures, including Tier 1 common and risk-based, would be taken into account by the regulators when considering requests for capital distributions. We tend not to highlight these ratios, as they are currently well in excess of regulatory minimums and consistent with other dividend-paying institutions. Nevertheless, these ratios would also improve along with Tier 1 leverage, supported by ongoing earnings, deleveraging and the run off of higher risk-weighted legacy assets.","As a matter of course, we continue an active dialogue with our regulators on this plan and our assumptions and are increasingly confident that our strategic and capital plan is the best path forward to unlocking shareholder value.","Now, while an optimal capital structure would have us eliminate holding company debt through a distribution of bank capital to pay down the notes, the timing and size of any such distributions would be subject to the schedule, targets and successful execution of several elements of our strategic plan. While we work toward that goal by focusing on improving our bank's leverage ratio, we are duly focused on refinancing high-cost debt down to current market rates.","Focusing on the $930 million of 12.5% notes due 2017, we estimate that a refinance today could reduce the coupon by more than half. Factoring the total cost associated with that debt, including the original issue discount and the unfavorable tax treatment, we estimate that a refinance at 6% would benefit earnings by approximately $0.20 per share annually.","Consequently, our focus continues to be addressing this debt once it's callable in December. There is also an opportunity to further reduce our debt cost by refinancing the $243 million of 7 7\/8% notes due in 2015.","If we were to refinance this full issuance alongside the 12.5% notes at the same illustrative rate of 6%, we estimate the benefit to earnings would be an additional $0.01 of annual EPS. Beyond improving earnings, refinancing either or both of these notes, in whole or in part, would also reduce a use of corporate cash while lengthening our maturity profile. That said, one of our key objectives with any new debt issuance would be to create a structure that allows for prepayment within a reasonable period of time without costly penalties in anticipation of ultimately receiving bank capital distributions.","As I highlighted last quarter, refinancing the 12.5% notes would result in a loss which would negatively impact our parent Tier 1 leverage ratio by approximately 50 basis points. Given our goal to maintain a buffer above the fully phased in well-capitalized minimum of 5%, our deleveraging efforts are integral to strengthening this measure in order to complete a refinance. The strategic and capital plan that we submitted to the OCC and Fed in June includes the assumption that we refinance the 12.5% notes in the next few months, bearing in mind they are first callable in December.","As an assessment of the parent that falls within the purview of the Fed, we maintain an active dialogue with them around our plans to complete a refinance.","Turning to our financial position. Corporate cash ended the quarter at $431 million, representing over 2.5 years of debt service coverage. Refinancing expensive debt would obviously improve this coverage ratio.","Our risk-based capital ratios at both the bank and parent increased during the quarter while the leverage ratios remained relatively flat, driven by the third quarter's net loss and balance sheet growth.","While we did complete some deleveraging actions during the quarter, our liability-driven balance sheet hinges on customer cash levels. This quarter, customer cash and deposits grew by $3.2 billion, principally generated by $2.2 billion of customer net selling activity and strong customer asset inflows during the quarter.","Nonetheless, our Tier 1 leverage ratio at the parent increased 10 basis points to 5.8% and remained flat at the bank at 7.9%. Our parent Tier 1 common ratio ended the quarter at 10.9%, and we estimate it would have increased by approximately 100 basis points under the proposed Basel III guidelines.","Reducing the size of our balance sheet remains a top commitment for us as we view this to be, along with earnings generation, the most effective path toward improving our capital ratios and ultimately, disturbing capital from the bank to the parent. We currently have several initiatives completed or underway, which total over $4 billion.","In addition, we have identified other opportunities which are not yet underway. The actions completed during the third quarter are as follows. First, we terminated $520 million of our fixed-rate wholesale borrowing which were set to expire in 2014. This resulted in a $51-million charge on early extinguishment of debt and was offset by security gains as assets were reduced to match the reduction of liabilities.","Second, we moved $470 million of sweep deposits off balance sheet as a result of eliminating one of E*TRADE's 3 bank charters. We utilize 5 charters which act as a waterfall for customer sweep deposits. Previously, the first 3 were E*TRADEs, with the fourth and fifth belonging to third-party institutions. This quarter, we completed a liquidation of the third charter, and the balances were assumed by an outside institution. The associated liabilities of $570 million were swept to that third-party institution and subject to regulatory approval, we plan to dividend approximately $50 million in capital associated with this charter to the parent in the fourth quarter.","Third, we changed the default cash option on our account application to a third-party money fund as opposed to \"on balance sheet\" cash products. This is beneficial to us from a leverage perspective and to the customer from a yield perspective. We have since added $300 million in customer cash to this fund.","Fourth, we recently reduced the rate paid on the majority of cash products to 1 basis point.","As for the initiatives which are underway or have been completed since quarter end, first, just this week, we completed the transfer of $1.2 billion of sweep deposits from our second charter to a third-party institution. With this transaction, our 5 charters' sweep product now has E*TRADE in the first edition, with the other 4 charters all off balance sheet.","Second, we plan to terminate or reduce wholesale borrowings by an additional $900 million in the fourth quarter. And lastly, we are pursuing a conversion of $1 billion of customer payables into third-party money market funds. In addition to deleveraging, transferring these balances would also have the benefit of reducing our lowest yielding assets' segregated cash.","In addition to the initiatives I just covered, reducing banking cash continues to be a key focus as it is not core to our strategy or balance sheet. Year-to-date, we have reduced banking deposits by $600 million. We continue to pursue alternatives to reduce these balances further, though we don't have anything to announce today.","Including the initiatives already completed and those in which we have a high degree of confidence, this equates to over $4 billion of deleveraging actions. We recognize that this quarter's efforts were offset by growth in customer cash. However, customer net selling was the primary driver of this growth, and we expect that to fluctuate over time.","As a reminder, our customers were net buyers of $3.9 billion in securities in the second quarter of this year. To that end, I would note that customer net buying in October has already reached approximately $700 million, with a corresponding reduction to customer cash and thus, to our balance sheet. With $1.3 billion of deleveraging initiatives completed in Q3 and over $3 billion targeted for the fourth quarter, we are making progress toward our goal of $5 billion to $10 billion in balance sheet reduction","With that, I will turn the call back to Frank for closing remarks.","Frank J. Petrilli","Thank you, Matt. In closing, while I'm not pleased to report a net loss, I'm very proud of the team and our accomplishments, particularly how our team executed this quarter against our long-term strategic plan. We believe there is significant value embedded in this franchise and we are focused on unlocking it for shareholders. Deleveraging is an integral step in getting us closer to both our long-term goal of eliminating debt and our intermediate goal of refinancing it. As you have now heard, we made significant steps forward in terms of our deleveraging efforts. Management is fully committed to executing against cost-cutting initiatives and ushering in a philosophical change around efficiency gains and process improvement. We continue to grow our core franchise even in the face of challenging market conditions characterized by declines in retail engagement and heightened macroeconomic uncertainty.","Finally, with respect to the search for our permanent CEO, the board is actively engaged in this process. We've hired a top-notch search firm, Spencer Stuart, and we are encouraged and impressed by the quality of candidates we've seen thus far. We will obviously update you once there is something to share.","As we wrap up the year, our commitment is that we will maintain laser focus on continuing to execute on each pillar of our strategy. Areas such as deleveraging, refinancing high-cost debt and expense reductions will remain top of mind for the management team. Additionally, we look forward to continuing the dialogue with our regulators related to our capital plan.","With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from the line of Alex Blostein.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So a couple of things. I guess, number one, on the incremental $3 billion of deposits that you guys are planning to move in the fourth quarter, can you give us a sense of how much in earnings that will cost you now and this price that you guys can move them at [ph]? And then more importantly, I want to kind of draw a parallel from that to your desire to refi the debt at the end of the year. I think last quarter, you talked about kind of maintaining a 5.5% Tier 1 leverage at the holdco and it feels like your core earnings is about $0.03 this quarter. So you're growing a little bit slower and you're moving some deposits off that's going to pressure organic capital generation and to refi the debt, you're going to get a 50 basis point capital. So kind of help us understand, I guess, what is your willingness and ability to refi in December seeing how you're naturally just generating less capital organically?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure, Alex, this is Matt. Yes, understood. So with respect to the $3 billion of deposits in Q4, if you look at our Q3 results, hopefully, you'll notice the increase cash on the balance sheet, so not customer cash but E*TRADE cash on the asset side. So we held off investing in loans and securities in anticipation of the deleveraging. So that's one of the things that really drove spread down in the quarter. So if you take where we are today, the impact on earnings of the deleveraging in Q4 really isn't that meaningful, given it's in cash earning fairly low rates, especially the segregated cash which is single-digit basis points. So not a huge item. With respect to refinancing the debt, I think the 5.5% target your referenced last quarter is the right number, and I would say we feel confident that with the $3 billion of deleveraging and our focus on refinancing in Q4, we feel confident that $3 billion is the right number to facilitate that refinance.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And did you guys get any feedback from the Fed on whether or not you'll be able to refi and go lower on your Tier 1 leverage at least temporarily and they'll be okay with that?","Matthew J. Audette","So we're in active dialogue with them. So I think that's the most I can say. We feel confident that $3 billion is the right number. We are in active dialogue with them on this transaction and our strategic plan assumes that we'll do so in the next few months. So that's the most I can say.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And my second question was on the incremental provision this quarter. I guess, you guys provided a little bit of color on that, I guess, what caused you to investigate issue to begin with but I think more importantly, looking out at the business and the practices that you have in place, do you need to dedicate more resources to make sure that something like this, I guess, either a, doesn't happen again and again more importantly, how do the regulators feel about this event? I don't know if you guys had any communication with them since.","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. So we are in active dialogue with our regulators on everything of importance, so absolutely on this one as well. I think the key thing is that we -- this came up fairly recently, just over this past weekend. And the key thing for us, if you followed in the prepared remarks, is one particular servicer reported to us an increase of bankruptcies and our own analytics and our own procedures noted the increase and we looked into it further. So I think we feel good that our existing process caught this and I think we feel even better that we've added a second process to go out and get some independent data to check the entire portfolio. And the things that I -- probably the best thing that I would add to that is when we came back, ultimately concluding with a $50 million of write-down, the majority of that was from that one particular servicer, meaning there was not a systemic problem. So I think with everything I just said, I think, we feel good about this issue going forward.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And just the last one on this topic. So the $90 million that you identified, what's the breakdown between home equity and first liens and then was the home equity written down to 0?","Matthew J. Audette","So this is a majority is home equity and we wrote it down to collateral value and the collateral value for home equities, especially those in the second position, is pretty close to 0. So it's a fair assumption it was written down to 0.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Joel Jeffrey.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just a question -- I mean, in terms of this specific servicer, I mean, historically, had their bankruptcy notifications been significantly less than the other servicers you've used?","Matthew J. Audette","No. It was the exact thing that occurred is our analytics of the reporting noted a spike, so that -- so it really jumped out, there wasn't nothing abnormal in the past.","Joel Jeffrey - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And second, how many servicers do you guys use?","Matthew J. Audette","I don't know, roughly 50, less than 50 range.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Keith Murray.","Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Can you just give a little color on the $900 million of wholesale reduction that you outlined for the fourth quarter? What would be the hit against that?","Matthew J. Audette","Sure. So specifically, we're targeting fixed rate Federal Home Loan Bank Advances. So similar to what we did, the $500 million that we did in the third quarter which had a $51 million prepayment penalty associated with it. So we don't have the exact number of what the prepayment cost would be but you would likely see a similar dynamic in Q4 in that we would sell securities to facilitate the reduction of those wholesale borrowings. So no precise numbers but the same type of transaction.","Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Got you. And then in your discussions with the regulator, I know the special servicer that you found this one issue with, has that come up? And do you have any concern that this is something that maybe should have been caught and they will kind of look negatively on that?","Matthew J. Audette","Well, anytime we know an issue, we always would feel like or hope we would've caught it before but I would tell you, we fully briefed the regulators on this particular issue and I would just reiterate that we are -- we're pleased at our own process and our own analytics noted issue, we looked into it further and then implemented an additional process above and beyond to go out to a third party to validate our entire portfolio. So while we're not pleased that we have this $50 million charge, we're pleased how we identified it and how we reacted to it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Repetto.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess, my first question is, Matt, you alluded just this weekend, this [indiscernible] light this weekend, could you expound on that, what the processes was here, just on identifying this?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes, sure, Rich. So our analytics noted this particular increase in bankruptcies in this particular servicer in the last month reporting. So it really came up recently and based on those analytics, we decided to go add this additional procedure. So it was something that came up fairly late in the process. So we worked throughout the weekend to make sure that we were comfortable with the data we had and it ultimately led to the identification of the $90 million and the $50 million write-down that we've discussed. So there's really no more to it than that. Is there anything particular you were -- that I missed there?","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","No, I was just wanted to make sure that when you said this weekend, I was just trying to clarify the timing because we're all looking at this thing last week with JPMorgan in their reporting. But anyway, next question...","Matthew J. Audette","It was a different issue. It was not connected to what -- the change that they had.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Understood, understood. And then, Matt, on that NIM, we just did rough calculations and I understand that cash -- that you have uninvested cash or cash sitting on the balance sheet uninvested but you're actually, I guess, with your guidance of a NIM just under 240 and then 10 basis points down from there, you're expecting a NIM rebound given -- even in this current environment, you're expected the NIM to rebound given your actions, I guess.","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. And specifically related to the cash that we have on balance sheet ahead of deleveraging, so if you look at that cash between segregated cash, you'd earn 7 basis points and -- or regular cash had earned 21 basis points during the quarter. So when we deleverage through that, you're really improving the spread in Q4, everything else being equal. The other thing I would highlight, for the 10 basis points, incremental basis points down in 2013. The same way during 2012, we've ratcheted it down during the year. We'd also ratchet it down during 2013. So we would likely enter 2014 probably down 15 basis points versus 2012, if that helps.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Understood. And the last thing for Frank, Mr. Efficiency here, we think is mark of the company, I guess. The $70 million in cost saves up from the initial $50 million and you targeted it at $100 million. Can you give us a little bit more, what do you call it, specificity on where are these coming from? Is it headcount? Again, sort of same questions that we asked last time but you had another quarter to look at this and I know this was in your past has been your area of focus. So where is E*TRADE -- how is E*TRADE going to come up the $70 million?","Frank J. Petrilli","So, Rich, thank you for not ignoring me but I'm going to pass it to Matt. He's the numbers guy.","Matthew J. Audette","All right, Rich. So I would speak to our target of $100 million. So we've identified $70 million but we're focused on getting to $100 million. And I would start off first, we've assumed in that $100 million about $20 million is from marketing. And then for the rest of the $80 million, I think the best way to think about is just looking at our expense base overall. There are certain things from a cost-reduction program perspective that you really can't impact, things like FDIC expenses, clearing and servicing, depreciation and amortization. Those are the things you can't really impact. What we can impact is comp and band, professional services and contractors and the like. So really cost really connected to people, so people that aren't necessarily employees of the company but all the people cost in our financials. So that's where we'll be focusing.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Chris Harris.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So the 9.5% Tier 1 leverage target for the end of '13 for the bank, I wonder if you guys can help us out a little bit with how you plan to get there, how much do you think is going be driven by the deleveraging, how much from potential earnings and utilization of the DTA? Just kind of maybe if you could you break that down for us, would be helpful.","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. So those are the buckets. I don't have precision on all those items. But I think deleveraging is key, that's where we have the $5 billion to $10 billion target of deleveraging actions that we're focused on. And then the other bracket is earnings and earning that utilize the DTA. So those are really the 2 primarily buckets that we're focused on to get there.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So the $5 billion to $10 billion that you're talking about the deleveraging, is that really just assuming today's deposit levels? So I guess, I'm wondering is if your cash continues to grow as you guys incrementally add more assets, could that number potentially go much higher? Because, I mean, this past year, what, you have $20 billion or so of asset growth given that new assets and market gains and it just seems like you'll ultimately have to delever a lot more, assuming some of that net new assets is in cash.","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. So customer flows is really the X factor when you look at a projection for balance sheet. So the way I've think about it is if we had customer cash inflows, it increases the size of the balance sheet. From a deleveraging initiative perspective, we would need to focus closer to the $10 million because the net balance increase would be -- or net balance sheet decrease will be a little bit less than that. If customer cash doesn't grow and flows out, then we'll focus from a deleveraging action perspective closer to the $5 million. So I don't have a customer cash forecast for you. That's kind of a dynamic that would be at play that would move us along in that range.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just last question for me, just following up on the net interest spread here. I was under the assumption that the deleveraging would potentially have a positive impact on the spread, given you're kind of rolling off lower yielding assets, and it seems like it's in line with your prior net interest spread guidance. So I'm wondering what would change with the mechanics? Why wouldn't we see a slight improvement in the spread guidance versus where we were before given the deleveraging?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. So the interest -- before meeting last quarter, the interest rate environment continues to be difficult. Each time we say on a call the interest rate environment is difficult, the next call gets even worse. And QE3 didn't help much towards the end of this quarter. So I think the environment is pressuring spread. Deleveraging, the incremental spread we earned to grow the balance sheet is absolutely low. So to your point, agree as we delever the spread that's coming off isn't incredibly high but I think the environment is a big driver and the environment is just incredibly difficult.","Operator","Our next question is from line of Chris Allen.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just looking forward to next quarter and you guys pointed kind of the high cash balances on the balance sheet and that's going to be the bucket you guys look at. I'm just wondering like looking historically, it is high right now relative to where it's been historically, but what's kind of the minimum level of cash balances we should kind of expect there, i.e., what else you would need to do above that to drive the debt paydown?","Matthew J. Audette","Well, we're -- we've got corporate cash just north of $400 million, right. So that's not something that's been fluctuating too much. Within the bank itself, we always want to keep a certain amount of cash for liquidity purposes, call it in the $750 million to $1 billion range and then you've got segregated cast in broker-dealers, which is difficult to predict, right. The function of our margin balances, as well as cash in the broker. So that one's going to be a little bit of an X factor but that's how I would think of cash in those 3 buckets.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay. And then, obviously, you guys will have to affect some gains of moving forward to offset some of the capital hits. Within the securities bucket, are there lower yielding assets, say 100- to 125-bip range that you'll be able to harvest those gains from?","Matthew J. Audette","Well, I think kind of the other side of the interest rate environment comment is that as we build our portfolio and the securities portfolio is really the only place where we buy securities and sell securities, almost everything else in the balance sheet is either a function of customers or our loan portfolios spanning down. Given those interest rate movements, the vast majority of things are going to be at a gain, right. So just any selling, you're typically going to have gain on sale and we've seen that for quite some time. So what I expect to see that minimum next quarter. And then depending on where the environment goes after that, the environment will tell. But next quarter, I would certainly expect it.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I guess, another way of asking it is, putting the environment aside, the stuff that you're looking at harvesting, would that negatively or positively impact kind of the securities yield as we kind of see it this quarter?","Matthew J. Audette","Well, sure. I would say the environment where we're reinvesting as a primarily driver but the economics of selling the security at a gain means it's yielding something higher than the current [ph] -- than where you could reinvest today. So it certainly have an impact but I think the overall environment is probably -- the changes in the interest rate environment are going to be the primary driver.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay. And then just following up on Rich's question on the expense saves. So we would be thinking about the expense saves above whatever we're building in terms of lower FDIC includes the services fees if the portfolio comes down?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. So the $100 million are specific actions we're taking or plan to take; it's not things like the FDIC's rates come down or the service and cost of the portfolio come out. It's in addition to that.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Bedell.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about the reinvestment yield, Matt, that you are assuming in your guidance for NIM in 2013? What type of securities would you be investing in terms of a duration profile and also, what kind of yields do expect in that guidance?","Matthew J. Audette","Right. So our reinvestment rate says that's certainly been impacted by the environment. So last quarter, we talked about reinvesting rates in the 125 to 150 basis point range. Where we are in the environment today, it's closer to 100. So you'll certainly see some compression there. As far as where we invested, there's no change in the investment strategy. It's agency backed, government-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities. So the same strategy that we've had for quite some time.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And is the 100 basis points off of your assumption in the 2013 guidance for now?","Matthew J. Audette","So the comment on spread is, given the environment that we're in today, what would happen to the balance sheet going forward. So it's not a comment on where the interest rate environment would be in 2013.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, no, that's perfect, okay. And then just on the cost save of side of it, do you have any revenue implications from there? Are you budgeting any revenue implications? Or is this just a purely a cost reduction that doesn't really have any revenue associated with it?","Matthew J. Audette","So we are planning for revenue impact of this. But I think, keep in mind the philosophy we have in this, we are focused on cutting lower returning initiatives, making sure we prioritize all the things that are important and are key to our strategic plan. So ultimately, the things that we stopped doing or the marketing dollars that we stopped spending on the margin would not be impactful from a revenue perspective but we're certainly planning for some level of impact.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Can you play in that level of impact at all or is it too early to tell?","Matthew J. Audette","How about relatively minor.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Relatively minor, okay, okay. And the ramp on that, on the cost save program, is it back-end loaded towards the end of 2013? Or do you expect to be getting a lot of this incremental saves over the next couple of quarters or so?","Matthew J. Audette","So our objective is to have it all in place by the end of '13 but the majority by mid-2013. So by the time we are in Q3 2013, we would hope to be in a place where the majority of them are in the run rate numbers for that quarter. We'll keep you updated along the way on how we're doing.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the risk management cost that Frank talked about earlier, the $10 million additional, that is over and above this $100 million, is that correct?","Matthew J. Audette","Right, so it would be at net $90 million.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Net $90 million, right, okay. And then just lastly, you said, I think you said -- did you say trading in October so far was down 13% versus September?","Matthew J. Audette","We did.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Matt Fischer.","Matthew Fischer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Real close back on the expenses, the $70 million that you've already identified, has any of that been realized yet or already?","Matthew J. Audette","Relatively minor amount. Specific to Q3 results, relatively minor amounts in there.","Matthew Fischer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And how much of that do you think you can start to realize in the fourth quarter?","Matthew J. Audette","So it's really the same commentary with Brian on the $100 million that we want to get the majority of it in place by the time we are -- for Q3 2013 numbers, right. So all of it by the end of the year but the majority into the run rate for Q3 2013.","Matthew Fischer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the $79 million gain on sale, how much of that is related to the decline in the wholesale funding?","Matthew J. Audette","So I think, the best way to think about gain on sale this quarter is as if that loss in early retirement of debt which is down at the bottom of the P&L was reported back up on the gain on sale line, right. So you net those 2 things together, you're in the mid- to upper 20s which is pretty consistent with what you've seen in the recent quarters for us. You've got to report it in different plays, so I just look at them together.","Matthew Fischer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. So the full $79 million would be related to wholesale funding?","Matthew J. Audette","No, I would just look at the 2 lines together, meaning the $79 million minus the $51 million down at the bottom, right. So in 20 -- $28 million range, which is consistent with what we've seen in recent quarters.","Matthew Fischer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then Rich touched on it but the -- some of the other banks were reporting the provisions, basically if a loan is underwater or negative equity, if the primarily loan is negative equity than home equity loan needs to be written down to collateral and you said that, that wasn't a factor in today's results. Have you done any analysis around that? I guess, a, why wasn't that -- I thought that was kind of implemented in the third quarter, so why was that included? And b, if you've done any analysis in terms of how much of your loan portfolio would need to be marked down to collateral if you did adhere to that regulation?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. So I think the change in regulatory guidance, I think, is a little bit different than that. So it was specific to a certain scenario of bankruptcies where a borrower files a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the bankruptcy is discharged and then the borrower does not reaffirm the debt and there's regulatory guidance on it that came out that said in that scenario, even if the loan is current, you have to charge it off the collateral value. Our policy on charging off bankruptcies is when we get notice of the bankruptcy, we charge it off. We don't have a scenario where we don't charge it off and it looks clear from all the banks that are reporting this quarter that updated their policies that they did. So I think a long way of saying our policies were much more conservative, that's why that guidance would have impacted us. It was more about that our servicers and this one particular servicer, mostly, had simply not reported the bankruptcy to us and that was the core issue.","Operator","And our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Alex Blostein.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on one more. So I'm a little bit confused around the cash balances question that somebody else asked earlier. So I look at the balance sheet, $2.8 billion, you're clearly not going to take it down to 0. You're moving $3 billion of deposits of the balance sheet and you're saying kind of like, all right, $3 billion is -- we have enough in cash, so it's not really earning us anything anyway. So can you help me understand that? So it does seem like you'll have to sell some securities, I guess, to move some of that $3 billion out and under that scenario, obviously there would be some impact on the NII. So I'm sure I'm missing something, would you mind just kind of fleshing those out?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. No, I don't think you're missing anything. I don't think the deleveraging in Q4 would be 100% funded with the cash. Just if you look versus last quarter, it grew in a meaningful way, so it's probably -- I'd call it the majority of it will be funded by that. But we would absolutely or likely have to sell securities to facilitate this. But then the other x factor will be what customer cash activity is in the fourth quarter. If a bunch of cash comes in, cash goes up, that may facilitate the deleveraging. If the trend we've seen in October continues with the $700 million of net buying, we would have to sell a lot more securities to facilitate the deleveraging. So it just all depends on the dynamics of the balance sheet in Q4.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then if you were to kind of stop the clock today, how much in net interest income would go away given how much in securities you would have to sell?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes, so I don't have that level of precision, Alex. I mean, if the balance sheet moves, it's pretty dynamic so I think we'll have to -- the things that I walk through, the best info I could give you, we'll have to see how we execute in Q4.","Operator","And our last question is from the line of Chris Harris.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Real quick on the provision expense, excluding onetime item you mentioned that the majority of the sequential increases is related to fewer putbacks, settlements. Should we expect fewer putbacks on a go-forward basis? So in other words, will your provision expense potentially be higher in the next couple of quarters than we've seen in the first half of the year?","Matthew J. Audette","So I think generally, putbacks should be declining. Our total program today relates to date of focusing on this. We're just under $400 million of putbacks given the age of our loans; we've gone through the vast majority of them. So I would say it's more behind us than ahead of us but it's not -- I wouldn't say it would be 0 in the future. I think when we talk about provision on the going-forward basis, we'll repeat over and over again that we think the long-term trend of provision will decline especially as the delinquent -- the delinquencies decline but you can always see variability in any given quarter and I think the last 2 quarters are great examples of that if you take out the $50 million, take out the $50 million, you saw $67 million last quarter, which I'd say is on the low end. And you see $91 million on the quarter -- for the quarter -- this quarter. So I think that's just a good example about how it can be volatile. But over the long term, we still expect it to continue to decline.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, Matt. And then assuming you guys get the springing net refi done prior to the end of the year, will there be some tax benefits to that? And if there are, maybe can you guide us to a pro forma tax rate you expect?","Matthew J. Audette","Yes. So the pro forma tax rate would be tough. I think, the estimated loss in the refinance in dollars would be north of $250 million, which would not be entirely tax-deductible. So I don't have a precise number for you other than the total amount wouldn't be tax-deductible. As far as an effective tax rate going forward, I think, when you get away from being close to breakeven or just under breakeven, that creates a little bit of volatility with the rate. Our long-term expected rate right now is in the 45% range because of about 1\/3 of the interest in the spring liens notes is not deductible. Once we refinance, especially if we refinance at the prevailing rates today, net interest would be deductible. So I would think about the long-term rate after that closer to the statutory rates with all the states will have around 40% is a good way to think about it.","Operator","And, Mr. Petrilli, we have no more questions on the telephone line. I'll now turn the call back to you for your presentation of closing remarks.","Frank J. Petrilli","All I want to say is thank you, all, for your time, and we look forward to our next call. Good night.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Joining the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Karl Roessner; Chief Financial Officer, Chad Turner; and Chief Operating Officer, Michael Pizzi.","Today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements, including statements about E*TRADE\u2019s future plans, objectives, outlook, strategies, expectations and intensions relating to its business and future financial and operating results and the assumptions that underlie these matters, strategic business initiatives including bolstering customer acquisition and retention, plans concerning capital deployment, continued repurchases of its common stock and outlook on the broader economic environment, which reflect management\u2019s current estimates or beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.","During the call, the company will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures.

This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available via phone and webcast later this evening at about.etrade.com. No other recordings or copies of this call are authorized or may be relied upon.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Roessner.","Karl Roessner","Thanks very much, Josh. Good evening and thank you for joining us on our Q1 earnings call. Amid a volatile yet historically bullish start to the year for all major indexes, the first quarter was beset by unique market dynamics and notable shifts in interest rates. Yet our strong operating and financial results proved once again that E*TRADE can thrive in a myriad of environments. Six months ago, we laid out a set of long-term financial commitments focused on EPS growth, operating margin expansion, return on equity and capital distribution.","Since that time, the operating environment has shifted meaningfully, yet we still remained squarely on pace to achieve our targets. In the first quarter, we produced EPS of $1.09, which included a few noteworthy items accounting for approximately $0.08 per share related to communications expense and provision for loan losses. We generated record net revenue and an adjusted operating margin of 50%, which excludes provision. This adjusted operating margin was bolstered by approximately two percentage points due to the benefit in communications expense I just noted.","Our reason for being will always be to deliver the best possible experience for our customers and to that end I am especially proud of what the team accomplished in the first quarter. In just these past few months, we\u2019ve continued the enhancements to our number one active trading platform Power E*TRADE, rolling out new widgets for active traders to further customize their dashboards, a new alerts manager and an idea generation tool for options strategies just to name a few.","For our main street investors, we also enhanced our web and mobile platforms including a refreshed quotes page, new choices within thematic investing, allowing customers to find investments that match their interests and passions and the revamped portfolio analysis tool allowing investors to clearly match their allocations against their goals and risk tolerance and rebalance with ease.","We emerged from this year\u2019s award session posting the largest one year rating improvement of any firm in Barron\u2019s Annual Online Broker Review where we also earn three best distinctions. We were also named the number one mobile platform and number one options trading platform according to stockbrokers.com. Our results of this review cycle reflect without a doubt our best performance in recent history and our testament to the work we\u2019ve done to continually improve our digital platforms and deliver a great experience for our customers.","Within the realm of wealth and cash management, our solutions for long-term investing continue to benefit from good engagement, while we made solid progress in our premium savings product with banking products having taken on a renewed focus for our firm. Customers that leverage our banking products tend to keep a far greater share of investible assets with E*TRADE, show better attention and engage with our brokerage products in a more meaningful way than those with only a brokerage relationship.","In particular, through the introduction of our premium savings account and the team\u2019s efforts to position it as a tool for those customers that come to E*TRADE through our corporate services channel we\u2019ve seen positive trends emerging in the retention of participant proceeds. We launched a significantly easier to use online application that will make the setup and funding of a bank account simple and seamless and we expected enhancements we are making on transactional banking services, digital payment solutions and securities based lending will continue to bolster customer acquisition and retention while deepening engagement.","Stock plan administration received a lot of attention during Q1 given the acquisition of another equity administration service provider a deal that focused much of the Street on something we\u2019d love to talk about, E*TRADE corporate services. The tremendous value this channel and our number one rated platform provide to our franchise cannot be overstated. From the opportunity it generates for our retail channel to the significant, yet to be tapped potential for advisors in our referral network, we anticipate its contributions will only increase over time. As such, we continue investing to protect in advance our leading position in the industry. And during the first quarter alone we onboarded nearly seven billion worth of new corporate services client relationships, keeping up with the torrid pace we set last year.","In our Advisor Services channel we are progressing through the systems integration while laying the groundwork for our referral network in order to connect customers who require more personal guidance with a carefully selected adviser. Our self-directed and stock plan participants provide a particularly attractive opportunity to the RIA community and we continue to see strong interest from high quality advisors of all sizes eager to join the program. We are being exceptionally deliberate in how we rollout this program and flows into the channel are still being restricted by design. While we\u2019ve brought a portion of our financial consultants online for the initial phase, we expect to roll it out to all local and national branches and kick the referral network into high gear later this year.","With regards to the significant number of relationships we acquired from Capital One in November of last year, we\u2019ve been very encouraged by the performance of these accounts with retention stats well above our expectations and increased trading activity. Our satisfaction scores with these valued customers have remained in the mid-90s through conversion to date, which is truly a testament to the great women and men in our customer service organization.","Before moving onto the operating results, I want to highlight the updates we made to the structure of metrics to better align to our customer channels. In addition to more clearly delineating customer accounts, assets, and flows by channel, we also took the opportunity to refine the thresholds to record customer trades and accounts. I will be discussing performance today under our revised methodologies. Chad will provide additional context on the changes and we have provided detailed summaries and schedules on our website.","Now for our results, we generated solid operating performance over the quarter. Our DARTs of 279,000 and derivative DARTs of 90,000 were the third strongest quarter on record for both measures. Q1 represented the best quarter of market performance this decade as measured by the S&P 500, even as the chorus of economic growth concerns grew louder. Our customers remained remarkably engaged among the uncertain environment as they were net buyers of 3.3 billion over the quarter and increased their margin positions by 700 million.","The waning days of 2018 yielded significant net selling by our retail traders and this trend extended into the first week of the new year. However, our customers were consistent net buyers throughout the remainder of the quarter. Interestingly, the strongest period for net buying and the biggest surge in margin balances occurred in late March after a dovish Fed report followed by weak economic data led to a briefly inverted three months and 10-year yield curve.","Month-to-date, customer activity has moderated with DARTs down approximately 8% from March and margin balances down slightly from quarter-end. On the customer acquisition front, we added 81,000 net new retail and advisor services accounts, our best quarter for account growth in over a decade, as we had strong contributions from retail and corporate services.","We generated net new retail and advisor services assets of $4.7 billion driven by positive inflows in traditional retail, robust contributions from corporate services and growth into our savings products. These flows represent a 6.2% annualized growth rate for retail and advisor services assets. Over the last 12 months, we generated a remarkable $99 billion of gross inflows into our corporate services channel, driven by $26 billion of new implementations and $73 billion of new grants and ESPP transactions. Over this 12 month period, participant sales generated net proceeds of $27 billion.","These participant proceeds serve us the opportunity set from which we aim to win relationships through our retail and advisors services channels. As of quarter-end, our total corporate services assets grew to $256 billion, driven by the strong pace of inflows and favorable market tailwinds.","To switch gears a bit, we have an important update to our executive team. I\u2019m pleased to announce that starting next month, former Citibank executive, Alice Milligan will be joining the E*TRADE team as our Chief Customer Officer, overseeing retail product and marketing to help drive the next generation of our digital and customer experience strategy.","At Citi, Alice served as Chief Digital Client Experience Officer for the North America Consumer Bank owning the complete customer life cycle. She will be a tremendous addition to an already strong team charged with the critical mandate of taking E*TRADE\u2019s great retail customer experience to the next level while helping us approach the market in new and innovative ways.","Finally, before turning the call over to Chad to discuss our financial results, I would like to thank our team for all their work in promoting a diverse workforce and creating an inclusive culture. Our employees are the lifeblood of E*TRADE and our diversity and inclusion practices are powerful differentiators in creating a great experience at work and beyond.","In this vein, I am proud to note recognition from the Human Rights Campaign, who named E*TRADE among the best places to work for LGBTQ Equality, earning a perfect 100 score for the first time in our company\u2019s history.","To sum up, it was another very strong quarter for E*TRADE as we continue to advance our core capabilities and lay the groundwork for emerging channels that offer broader solutions to our customers and carry powerful synergies across our business. Our model continues to produce and we are still squarely on target to surpass $7 of EPS by 2023, while also delivering on our other stated financial commitments.","With that, I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Chad Turner, to discuss our financial performance.","Chad Turner","Thanks, Karl. For the quarter, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $270 million or $1.09 per diluted share and net revenues of $755 million, up $47 million from the year ago quarter. Including the quarter was $12 million or $0.04 benefit to provision for loan losses and $14 million or $0.04 benefit in communications related to market data usage. The communications benefit relates to an adjustment in estimates for the fees we pay for real-time market data and the higher rates assigned to users that are designated professional traders.","As for core results, net interest income increased by $10 million sequentially, as our net interest margin expanded by 3 basis points to 323 basis points. And our average interest-earning assets grew by approximately $900 million. Our NIM improvement was driven by an 8 basis point expansion in gross yield offset by a 4 basis point greater cost of funds. Despite the difficult rate backdrop, the yield on assets improved as we realize the full benefit of the December fed rate hike benefited from certain well time securities purchases and better than expected performance of our securities and hedging portfolio.","Average interest-earning assets were $61 billion, reflecting growth in deposits. This growth came amid continued customer net buying in each month of the quarter. The resiliency of our deposit base continues to underscore three key structural elements for E*TRADE. First, our predominantly self directed retail customer base carries greater cash balances compared with those in advice relationships.","Second, on average we capture around 10% of our customers\u2019 share of investible wealth. Coupled with the relatively smaller average size of E*TRADE\u2019s accounts, this translates to cash balances that are stickier in nature, building from uninvested proceeds and accumulated dividends and interest payments. Given the relatively small portion, this cash represents of our customers\u2019 overall wealth. These deposits are primarily viewed as transactional cash rather than investible cash and tend to be far less subject to yield seeking behavior.","Third, our Corporate Services channel is a tremendous feeder of not only accounts and assets, but more specifically cash. Corporate Services assets will always be in motion, but our growing Corporate Services channel ensures a steady stream of customer deposits. Earlier, Karl spoke to the growing inflows and customer proceeds in our Corporate Services channel. We\u2019ve included a new Corporate Services roll forward in our investor deck, which illustrates the progression of that channel and highlights the growing participant transactions, which serves as the pool of proceeds that we have an opportunity to capture in our Retail or Advisor Services channels.","Moving to the cost of funding, our blended deposit rate, including customer payables, rose from 25 basis points to 32 basis points, driven higher primarily by growth in our premium savings balances. For Q2 we expect the blended deposit rate to be in the mid-30s. Growth in premium savings may pressure deposit costs, but it is already proven effective as both a customer acquisition and retention tool.","Today, one of the largest sources to the growth of this product has been corporate services, where we are seeing early signs of increased proceeds retention. Our average reinvestment rate in the securities portfolio is currently just north of 300 basis points. We anticipate that our NIM will moderate from the Q1 level with our current expectations for full year 2019 net interest margin of 315 basis points to 320 basis points.","This holds customer margin balances at their current levels, does not contemplate changes to fed funds rate over the course of the year and assumes continued strength in deposit growth. A 25 basis point move up or down in short-term rates would translate to a 3 basis points annualized impact NIM. As a reminder, we included disclosure in our investor deck that gives the sensitivity of eight different shifts and twists of the yield curve.","Commissions revenue of $122 million was relatively flat compared to last quarter as a moderation in DARTs was offset by an improvement in commission per trade. We updated our customer trade reporting to exclude non-commissionable activity like commission for ETF trades and rebalancing trades associated with our managed products. Trades in these areas have naturally grown over time, as we have improved our investing tool and we thought a presentation that were closely aligns to commission revenue would be more helpful to investors.","Understanding what a burden changes to reporting can be in the heat of earning season. We have posted a schedule to the website that shows our customer activity metrics under both the old and new approach. Going forward, we plan to report only under the new methodology. Specific to the change in trade reporting, DARTs will decrease, while derivatives percentage and commissions per trade will increase from previous reporting.","As for CPT, we expected to range from $6.90 to $7.30 through 2019 under our new methodology, which is roughly equivalent to the $6.60 to $7 range we provided under the prior definition on last quarter\u2019s call. Fees and service charges of $118 million were up $10 million sequentially driven primarily by seasonally strong foreign exchange revenue from corporate services and higher fees earned on off-balance sheet cash.","The average net yield on third party cash was up 16 basis points to 164 basis points driven primarily by the December fed funds increased. In Q2, we anticipate the rates on off-balance sheet cash will be roughly flat to Q1 levels. Gains were $11 million and we continue to expect to realize around $10 million per quarter.","Moving to expenses, non-interest expense was $375 million, adjusting for the market data benefit expenses would have been $389 million of modestly from the prior quarter. Compensation and benefits of $164 million was up $12 million sequentially due to seasonal factors including higher payroll taxes.","Total marketing expense was $54 million, up $6 million from last quarter, but down $6 million from the year ago level, which included advertising expense for the Super Bowl and the Olympics. For the full year, we continue to forecast marketing spend of around $200 million, but we preserve flexibility that toggle this spend based on market conditions.","As for corporate cash, we finished the quarter at $329 million, reflecting $250 million in subsidiary dividends, less a $120 million we use to repurchase our stock, the $35 million paid in common dividends and the $20 million paid in preferred dividends. As a reminder, we target holding a minimum of $300 million in corporate cash. We have $379 million remaining on our buyback authorization and we plan to utilize it at a measured pace over the balance of the year. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 26% and we continue to expect the full year tax rate for 2019 to be around 27%, noting that it can vary quarter-to-quarter.","In closing, our performance in the first quarter continues to illustrate the strength of our long-term earnings model through ever changing market conditions, underscored by steady growth of customer deposits, resilient investments spreads and consistent capital deployment.","And with that, we will open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Rich Repetto","Good evening, Karl and Mike and Chad. First I guess, Karl, your favorite topic, the corporate stock plan business, great growth the 24%. I guess the question, as you did mention this in the prepared remarks about competitor buying Solium and then another peer announcing a partnership, which certain. So I guess, it validates your model from one respect, but you also talked about in the past how you\u2019ve had wins because at least one of these plays have pulled back. So could you talk about the competitive environment going forward given these transactions in the space or at least the partnerships in the space?","Karl Roessner","Yes. Look, it\u2019s a great question. The way that we look at it and way we continue to look at this environment is any partnerships, acquisitions, any dislocation create additional opportunity for our phenomenal team to go out and participate in RFPs. Our win percentage still remains up in the 70% on \u2013 in RFP land. So very pleased with the opportunity at hand, I think the most important thing for us, Rich, is to continue to meet the demands of our customers, right.","And on this front, it\u2019s B2B, it\u2019s the corporate client, continuing to drive value for them, listen to their concerns, build the tools and functionality that they need to run their stock plan more efficiently and effectively. But allow them to plug in the tools that they want to our software, so that they can get the data that they need out of it. And continue to have, who I think are the best in the business in terms of implementation and ongoing handholding for the corporate service teams.","So I think we\u2019re in a very good place. I think we\u2019re in very good shape to continue to compete. And we\u2019re not going to let any grass grow under our feet on this business. We\u2019ll continue to invest in it. We\u2019ll continue to invest in the software, drive the number one platform, further upstream and attempt to continue to drive ourselves and distance ourselves from our competitors, Rich. So I look at it as opportunity.","Rich Repetto","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And I guess, my follow-up would be, you did mention at least on the two big acquisitions last year, sort of the strategy of the outlook on the referral service being deliberate. But I guess, could you sort of update on the Cap One accounts, because that a large number of accounts, nearly a million accounts, a lot of assets. Can you talk about the opportunity there to sort of grow that share a wall with those customers?","Karl Roessner","The Capital One population, we\u2019re very excited about and just the way that we set up the onboarding and we still have the customer set numbers that I mentioned in the prepared remarks. We\u2019re in the mid-90s with the new customer population coming onboard. And that\u2019s really a result of white-glove treatment of bringing over the more valuable accounts, the higher end of that book in advance of the actual closing. Making sure they understood our platform, over communicating to that population, making sure that our new customer base knew who E*TRADE was, understood the tools and functionality and saw the way that we were going to treat them.","So I am very excited about the level of engagement that we\u2019ve seen both in terms of additional trading and engagement with our digital wealth offering. And then some on the services on the premium bank account side. So, very pleased with where we are. I do believe there\u2019s additional opportunity to market into that population as they learn more and more about E*TRADE. But that really comes from the initial days of the integration and the first time welcoming them in. So our customer service teams and our operations teams absolutely did a wonderful job on that transaction and we have some very happy new customers.","Rich Repetto","Okay. Thank you, Karl, and congrats on the strong quarter here.","Karl Roessner","Thanks very much, Rich.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Devin Ryan","Great. Good afternoon, guys.","Karl Roessner","Good afternoon.","Devin Ryan","Maybe a follow-up here just on corporate services. So I appreciate, I guess, the walk up and walk down of those assets. And I\u2019m curious, the $73 billion of new grants in purchases, is that a reasonable starting point? I know it\u2019s going to move year-to-year, but that seems like a very large number. So I\u2019m just curious if that\u2019s maybe a reasonable starting point for our models. And then the 27 billion opportunity to capture proceeds, what are you guys thinking about as a good target of retention there, especially as you\u2019re looking to do more with the RIA\u2019s to win more of their wallet. And then I guess just the last piece, I know it\u2019s a long question, the bigger picture with RIA, getting them into the corporate services customers and getting them in front of the participants. Do you guys have a current estimate of that kind of addressable market and loving update there as well?","Karl Roessner","Sure. So just in terms of the run rate or the replenish of the securities book itself that comes through this in the options and the restricted shares and the grants that come through the pipeline. It\u2019s really, it\u2019s based on the market value of the companies that we service and that our corporate service customers. But, yes, I mean the $73 billion, it\u2019s why we continue to talk about having the best corporate services experience and driving additional corporate clients into that pipeline is the best thing we can do to continue to drive opportunity downstream. So that our retail forces and our advisory services forces together with the tools and functionality that we have up and coming through the bank and also through our digital wealth offering to continue to drive that population. I mean, you sort of see the walk, we\u2019ve laid it out as transparently as we can.","It\u2019s a phenomenal opportunity. So, yes, the $73 billion assuming those prices stay where they are on the corporate plan participants with the plans we have in the book now, that\u2019s the right level. On \u2013 I mean, part four \u2013 part B, I\u2019m not sure which part I\u2019m again at Devin, sorry. But on the 27 billion population, the beautiful thing about the model that we put out and how we\u2019ve shared over this five year plan is that we\u2019ve held our retention rate for that population relatively flat to where it was, all right. So that sort of in that 15% range after one year that we always continue to talk about.","Do I believe that we have the tools and services necessary to really start and drive at that population? Absolutely. One of the tools that we\u2019ve seen, just initial early days with the premium savings account, making that available for the corporate services clients, we\u2019ve seen a lot of interest and we believe that we have some uptick in retention. But we don\u2019t have all the data yet, right. We look at that on a year basis. And it\u2019s early days, but when you couple that with our digital offering, with what we\u2019ve done on the plan participant website, some of the tools and functionality that we\u2019ve made available. I like our chances to drive that up, but I\u2019m not going to give you sort of numbers or ticks and ties walk from that 15%. I will just tell you that it\u2019s a great opportunity for us.","And then I guess the last part, or at least the last part that I heard was on the RIA side, and the availability there. As you might imagine, we are being very deliberate and very cautious about the RIAs who we would let into these corporate clients. They will need to be vetted. They\u2019ll need to be approved by the corporate client. We\u2019ll walk through the owners of the plans, right. The people who our corporate services teams liaise with, to make sure that they are comfortable with any kind of education, speaking engagements or other tools that we may use to let the plan participants know about this.","That\u2019s a part of the network, Devin, that we are working on. We have not rolled it out yet to the corporate services side. But you might imagine that, the names Edelman and Mercer that we\u2019ve just turnaround in terms of the top two companies on. There\u2019s a distinct reason, you look for premium RIAs when you do things like this. So that\u2019s absolutely a part of the plan, and longer term solution. But that\u2019s a build in connection with the integration and rolling out that referral network.","Chad Turner","And Devin, this is Chad. Just to add to the corporate services piece. If you look at the bottom of that roll forward page, you\u2019ll see the historical inflows as well as the proceeds coming through. So that gives you the perspective of not just the trailing 12 months, but also what that\u2019s looked like overtime.","Devin Ryan","Yes. Okay, great. Thank you. Good memory catching all those. Appreciate it. And then just quick follow-up \u2013 the follow-up is just on pricing, and we\u2019re hearing for some of your peers, they\u2019re looking at different pricing models, and potentially even subscription models for certain client sub-segments, just to get clients to focus on kind of the differentiating parts of the platform versus just a commission rates. I\u2019m just curious, your thinking on that, if that\u2019s something that you guys have thought about, or would think about, and just if you have any opinion about that?","Karl Roessner","And so we\u2019ve heard the same thing. And we definitely talk about it and we look at what the competitive landscape is doing, but what it comes back to for us as a value proposition that the traders and investors that we have on our platform get from each rate. And the price points that are now out there in the marketplace. And you think between the execution quality that we provide the world class customer service, the top rated platforms on the options and derivatives sides in particular. We feel like the value prop is really there. So we\u2019re not going to be a first mover on a price moves. Subscription model might make sense for some, but for us, we like the value proposition that we offer to our clients and we\u2019re pretty happy where we are.","Devin Ryan","Okay, great. Thank you.","Karl Roessner","Thanks Devin.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Steven Chubak","Hi, good evening. So one of the key things off with question on the profitability targets after adjusting for the market data benefit this quarter, it looks like the adjusted op margin came in closer to 48.5% and given some of the seasonal extent headwinds in 1Q. Some of the business side, momentum Karl that you excited, particularly on the corporate services side, it just feels like that 48% margin target for 2019, 50% for 2020, actually represents a pretty low bar given some of that momentum. So any reason you chose not to adjust the margin targets this quarter and maybe more importantly how we should think about that operating margin trajectory over the next couple of quarters?","Karl Roessner","So look, we\u2019re still in the \u2013 Steven, we\u2019re still in the same place in terms of op margin for the sort of 50% in 2020, and then mid-50s in 2023, so standby that guidance. You\u2019re going to see that sort to ebb and flow a little bit as you just said with the pressures that come from the expense space and just some seasonality that goes through. We\u2019re also continuing to invest in our business and we continue to look at projects that we have on the board, right, investing in technology, investing in our people. So, I\u2019m very comfortable with where we are in terms of \u2013 in terms of Op margin guidance and we\u2019ll stick to it there.","Steven Chubak","Understood. And just one follow-up from me, on the deposit outlook. So you talked about the deposit repricing closer to the mid-30s in 2Q, immediately that was a touch higher than we had expected, but you did also side some of the benefits from attracting more assets on the corporate stock line side as a result of those efforts. And just wondering how we should think about deposit competition in a lower for longer interest rate environment and what sort of trajectory is contemplated within that 315 basis points to 320 basis point NIM range I was cited earlier?","Chad Turner","Yes. Steve, this is Chad. On our \u2013 on the long-term earnings slide. We talk about there being no fed funds either cuts or increases in our overall long-term plan to get to greater than $7. So, I\u2019d use that as a guideline, not only for the long-term but also for 2019 and how we\u2019re guiding. As it relates to how we think about deposit costs overtime. We\u2019ve used the 20% beta in both up and down scenarios, over time that, that would be what we would expect our deposit betas to be. In some periods we have moved that a little bit more.","And for example, in December, just given our evaluation of the competitive environment, we didn\u2019t move \u2013 we didn\u2019t move base deposit rates at all. So those are examples of just how that looks. You mentioned premium savings. That\u2019s a little bit of, as we talk about guiding to the mid-30s, there\u2019s some contemplation of that having some, we\u2019re really happy about how that\u2019s performing and some continued growth there. But broadly our betas are holding up and we feel confident about cash growth at those betas over time.","Steven Chubak","Great. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks for taking my questions. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Chris Harris","Thanks. Hey guys. So yes, as you know, interest rate expectations have changed a lot in the last three months. Now there\u2019s some concern about, the fed potentially cutting rates from here. Wondering whether you guys could still maintain the margin targets that you\u2019ve put out under a scenario where the fed rate cut, say 25 basis points. In that scenario, what are some of the actions we might see trade to do, to help to maintain the margin?","Chad Turner","Hey Chris, this is Chad. So, I \u2013 in our long term earning slide, as I just was \u2013 as I was just talking to Steven mentioned as Steven, we do \u2013 we do hold fed funds flat. In the investor deck we give you a bit of the scenarios around what that looks like in \u2013 in any given increase or decrease in and twist of the curve. I\u2019d note that there are many paths to $7 as we have said before. And so that can come through in different interest rate environments, as well as different overall customer engagement levels. We\u2019re comfortable and we have looked at that in those different environments as far as how $7 looks in those different types of environments. We\u2019re comfortable that there are lots of paths to it. So, I would just note that as you\u2019re thinking about the overall interest rate framework.","Karl Roessner","And the one thing just to throw out there for you, Chris, is \u2013 and we\u2019ve been pretty consistent on this. We\u2019ve put these targets and, and sort of the guidance or long-term guidance out there, in terms of where we think we can get to. But if it\u2019s an environment like that, that starts to get difficult, we\u2019re not going to take actions just to hit an Op margin target, right. If it\u2019s going to be disruptive to shareholder value or it\u2019s otherwise going to put our business at risk. So that that should always be the guiding principle, isn\u2019t it, our shareholders do use their capital and driving this business forward comes first.","Chris Harris","Helpful. Thanks guys.","Karl Roessner","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","Hi. Good morning.","Karl Roessner","Good morning, Brennnan.","Brennan Hawken","Sorry, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question.","Karl Roessner","We know the feeling.","Brennan Hawken","Yes. Okay. So, given last year\u2019s tax reform and lower withholding rates that we\u2019ve heard about from some tax professionals. There\u2019s an expectation that there could be some different dynamics happening with tax payments this year. And given how this is a seasonal dynamic for you all, but just curious if there\u2019s any early read on how customers are behaving this year versus prior years and whether you\u2019re seeing anything jump out that that\u2019s different?","Karl Roessner","So, we just sort of come through tax season. We haven\u2019t seen any different behaviors. Our customers are highly engaged during this period with us, particularly in the week leading up to tax day and then Monday of this week in particular was very heavy engagement. We man the phones; man the chats, something got through it like we do every other year. So, I think the team did a great job. But we haven\u2019t seen anything that\u2019s been the typical outflows around April to make tax payments. But none of that has come through yet at least we haven\u2019t seen it. We\u2019re going to need some more data and some more experience to make any kind of judgment on that.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. That\u2019s fair. Certainly, sort of happening in real time at this stage. And then Chad, I think highlighted some hedging \u2013 strong hedging results. I\u2019m guessing that, that\u2019s reflected in your NIM outlook, but just kind of wanted to confirm that that\u2019s the case and then maybe understand and maybe how much 1Q NII was attributable to hedging that might not necessarily repeat? Thanks.","Chad Turner","Yes. Brennan, there were a number of factors that that drove kind of the net interest margin performance in Q1. One, you start with a period of slowing prepayment speeds. That\u2019s just seasonally coming into the kind of the winter months, which are usually slower leading out of the fourth quarter in terms of activity on the book. We were able to invest earlier in the quarter in a more meaningful way and put a lot of the sort of cash growth and forecasted cash growth to work at better than average yields and where yield sort of ended the quarter that gave us a pretty good benefit overall.","Security selection spread movements also help. And then, lastly, and it\u2019s a more technical point, some of the movements that occurred really in the short-term LIBOR rates gave us a bit of an advantage overall and hedge performance, all of that led to the performance in the period. Looking forward, we obviously factor in some of that in terms of the ability of the portfolio investments that were made at higher than average yields during the period. But by and large, some of those factors we normalize out into the guidance.","Brennan Hawken","Makes sense. Thanks for the clarity there.","Operator","Our next question comes from a line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. Just wanted to follow up on a previous question regarding the margin outlook. You do mention in the slide deck, multiple cost saving levers if the macro environment or macro factors change. So, wondering what those levers might be to kind of hit the chart?","Karl Roessner","So, perhaps when we look at this, we call out immediately the $200 million that we spend on marketing, right? If you\u2019re not driving an efficient return from that invested capital, you\u2019re going to start throttling that back and spending in areas, where you need to keep your customer engagement up and keep your product set out in the marketplace. So, you can definitely throttle some of that back. The other thing that we have is a very disciplined management team.","So we have a list of projects that we do both on the technology side that are linked with the business side and how we push those through. There are definitely some that you could look out and say, well, we can delay that, right? What\u2019s the return? What is the customer looking for? How are we going to push this forward? You focus on things like corporate services, like our advisor services business and our customer experience. You drive those projects forward and you take a look at what else you can delay without harming the customer experience. So, we go through that as a management team on a pretty regular basis, so that that\u2019s the kind of decision-making that we go through in that type of an environment.","Dan Fannon","Got it. Thank you.","Karl Roessner","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","All right. Thanks guys and thanks for taking the questions. First on a net interest income outlook, the NIM is helpful, but just given some of the declining cash balances that we\u2019re seeing in the industry and you guys in to do a good job of just explaining, E*TRADE is a different model and maybe some of the products being offered. But how do you think about deposit growth in this backdrop and more importantly, if it does slow, should we expect any shifts in the NIM outlook?","Karl Roessner","No. We contemplate it in our overall NIM outlook. We contemplate that deposit growth happening. I would just \u2013 I would separate it between what you have at core retail growth across the sweeping and customer payable balances and then the assumption of some great continued growth in premium savings that we\u2019re seeing some good traction. But broadly, that would be contemplated in that 315 to 320 over the year.","Michael Carrier","Okay. And then just a follow-up, just on the capital front, you guys had been active and particularly in the fourth quarter on the buybacks and then you\u2019ve done deals, just maybe an update, based on what you\u2019re seeing out there on the M&A side. Where is the priority, just given what you\u2019ve done over maybe the last 12 months?","Karl Roessner","The priorities remained the same. We\u2019ve talked about what we would do on the inorganic side; look for scale, right extensions into product sets that we\u2019re already in build versus buy, right? What can we go out and acquire and bolt on rather than expanding and building it here ourselves. So, you might see that, if you could find more additional in the brokerage space, in the advisor channel, or if there are additional tools or services that we could offer. So, it\u2019s really the same set of potential inorganic opportunities, but the same mantra around here that we\u2019ve always lived by is use of capital, right? Are we looking through the right lens? Are we using our capital in the most effective way for our shareholders and can we generate the return on capital that that requires to do a deal when you look at that analysis. So, really more of the same in terms of what we\u2019ve been looking at and always through the capital lens.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Karl Roessner","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Will Nance with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Will Nance","Hey guys. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow-up on the question on the deposit rate guidance, but just the kind of five, four or five basis point increase quarter-over-quarter that you guys are guiding to. I guess if we continue to see the same sort of mix of deposit growth between the premium savings and just kind of core suite balances, what is a reasonable assumption for increases and deposit costs going forward beyond this quarter?","Karl Roessner","Yes. the guidance of 315 to 320 that assumes the continued growth of premium savings like we\u2019ve seen, as I mentioned earlier, I\u2019d note that we don\u2019t have that growing out over time in perpetuity at the levels that you\u2019re seeing today. We think it\u2019s a good tool to stem retention now and provide opportunities to then sell other products too, for example, on the corporate services side.","They use it as a tool, a little bit of a gate to stop customers from leaving and then sell them and delight them with the rest of our investing and wealth management products. So that would be the way I would think about a bit of that growth. You\u2019re seeing that early here, but it is not assumed that that would carry over the long period of our five year multiyear plan that puts that would have over \u2013 that would have a way a bit over time and slow down.","Will Nance","Got it. I appreciate that. And then I think last quarter you talked about, the leverage you have if market conditions and reinvestment yields on securities kind of warranted taking a different strategy on balance sheet growth. I guess since then we\u2019ve seen the curve kind of flattened further and we\u2019ve kind of gone up and down, but kind of in the same range on the stock price, I guess, is that option something that you would still consider and I guess how close are we from heading down that path, given what we\u2019re seeing in the market today.","Karl Roessner","You are absolutely well. If you go back to kind of where the quarter ended in rates, I mean the numbers are, would be really clear, but obviously we\u2019re not going to make a strategic decision around sort of any one day\u2019s yield curve we\u2019re seeing, April levels back up a bit in terms of yields. Spreads were fairly attractive as well, during parts of the prior quarter, and on certain areas of the market now. So overall, we will look at it. It\u2019s still very much an option. It is a lever by which we can drive and maintain value. So it\u2019s something that we will continue to look at.","Will Nance","Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Kyle Voigt","Hi. Most of my questions have been answered. I guess just one follow up. I think you said on the prepared remarks you\u2019re starting to see some positive trends in the retention of the stock plan participant proceeds. Just trying to see if you can put some numbers around that in terms of what that early success means.","Karl Roessner","So let me try and just take you through the way that this has been working. You\u2019ll get a better sense of why we\u2019re excited about what we\u2019re seeing early days and just recall that. When we look at the stock plan proceeds retention number, that\u2019s usually on about a 12-month look back. So we\u2019re early days, so I don\u2019t have those numbers for you in terms of percentage moves or one to have any whatever percentage point moves you\u2019re going to look for.","On the PSA itself, we\u2019ve been extremely excited about what we\u2019ve received there in terms of inflows. I would call about 70% to 75% of the inflows from PSA is home run growth, I actually call it home run growth. So it\u2019s about 30% of that 75% is coming from corporate services clients who are engaging with the product and we\u2019re seeing some uptick in customers engaging with products and staying there and just like Chad laid out or we just talked about previously that\u2019s the opportunity for us to rollout digital wealth offering to roll out additional banking solutions to form a relationship with E*TRADE through our customer experience and ultimately through our, whether it would be the advisor channel or an FC-type relationship to drive those customers in. So very pleased with early day results and we have seen additional engagement that we just haven\u2019t seen before from corporate stock plan. So no numbers yet, but a very good result early days.","Kyle Voigt","Got It. Thank you.","Karl Roessner","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Brian Bedell","Thanks very much. Just a follow-on on that question. And by the way, thanks for the additional disclosure on the segments. It really does help us analyze things a little better. But for the Row IV in the stock that the 15% of the $27 billion, so basically what you\u2019re saying is over the last 12 months it has got about 4 billion into the retail channel from the corporate stock plan channel and I\u2019m just trying to understand the composition and that flow through from the premium savings and then into basically retail brokerage accounts if that\u2019s maybe too new to talk about or are you seeing an actual transition from the premium savings into retail brokerage?","Karl Roessner","So I would it\u2019s not a way around question, but it\u2019s definitely early days. This is the first quarter that we actually have data like this on what the corporate services, stock plan customers are engaging with and we\u2019re seeing them engage early in that vest or when the grant sort of comes out and exercise their option or when they get their RSUs and they have cash in their account. We\u2019re seeing them engage with our PSA relatively quickly and early in the engagement, which gives us an opportunity to share with them the value proposition that is E*TRADE.","And so building out that stock plan participant side, getting the RIA channel up and running, making sure that our digital wealth offering is right and that our banking products are aligned right with the peer-to-peer payments, the ability to fund the account easily, making sure that you can get all their documents. The simple stuff is what we need to do, right when we have those tools set up over the next few months, I\u2019ll have a lot better data for you.","Brian Bedell","Okay. And that was a little bit of my second question, which was on that transactional banking, do you feel that you\u2019ve got that full product set there in terms of online bill pay ability to say, write checks from your account or use Apple Pay or do you expect \u2013 or do you think you need to invest more in that transactional banking first before you have a full set? I guess I\u2019m trying to get at whether that\u2019s in the salesforce right now?","Chad Turner","So let me just an update on the banking side, banking is, is a very important part of customer relationship and what we see there and we\u2019ve talked about this in the past, is additional retention of the customer is a lot better, they bring more assets, they engage with us more frequently and there\u2019s more transactions that come through the account when they have that overall banking relationship.","Our Bank has had the product set or at least portions of the product set, deposit product, check writing, bill pay, the basics have been there for quite some time, but we hadn\u2019t invested in the experience over a very long period of time. So I would say there\u2019s a good chunk of products in the bank now that lets us start that relationship. We\u2019ve revamped all of the pages to the banking experience and we\u2019ve just remedied a lot of the issues that we had on our online application that has some historical feeds and requirements in it that were just prohibited from opening up a bank account.","So we\u2019re early days on that front, but I feel like we have a pretty good stable of banking products. There\u2019s more we need to do right on the peer-to-peer side on being able to sort of fund an account more easily, how can we roll that forward, what other services could we offered for our client who\u2019s going to engage on the banking side, that\u2019s what we need to drive that to secure these relationships. So a lot of it\u2019s there where a good portion of it\u2019s there, the experience and seeing what customers really want and need to form that relationship.","Brian Bedell","Got it, that\u2019s a good color. Thank you.","Chad Turner","Yes. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Craig Siegenthaler","Hey, good evening guys. We just saw one of your large competitors cut their deposit sweep rates across several tiers. I\u2019m just wondering what it would take for each REIT to also found this direction and cut rates.","Chad Turner","Yes, Craig this is Chad, we typically follow fed funds, that\u2019s been our consistent practice and \u2013 but we\u2019re constantly monitoring the overall environment, the competitive landscape. We\u2019re comfortable with where our rates are as of today, that 20% data over time, acknowledging that in any given period could be a little different is, is the right way to think about it. So we typically do that around fed funds cycles.","Craig Siegenthaler","And then just as my follow-up here, a housekeeping item. Footnotes at team, there was a very large increase in savings, checking and other banking assets like $1.7 billion off a small base. I\u2019m just wondering what specifically drove that?","Karl Roessner","That is where the premium savings product that we\u2019ve been discussing rolls up.","Craig Siegenthaler","Got it. And that type of growth rate is pretty normal.","Michael Pizzi","That product was new in the middle of last year, so you\u2019re seeing based on \u2013 compared to history, you\u2019re seeing a growth that is definitely more than it\u2019s been over time.","Karl Roessner","Yeah. And the number to think about when we talk about 75% of that sort of being or 70, 70% being home run growth, right. So 30 some odd percent of that\u2019s coming from stock plan engaged customers, which is why we sort of like where we\u2019re headed with the product.","Chad Turner","Yeah. And Craig, if you looked at that over time, you would actually go back and see that it was declining. To Karl\u2019s point, we\u2019ve not only seen customers go in there around customer \u2013 corporate services and the ability to retain more there. But we\u2019ve also stem some of that historical bank attrition where those customers, it was runoff bank products and they were just leaving to go somewhere else. So this product that also act as a primary opportunity to give back engage with those legacy bank customers that may have been leaving us and to stem some of that decline as well.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Michael Cyprys","Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Just on the corporate services business seeing some nice growth there the $72 billion new grants and $256 billion or so in assets. I guess, where do you see your market share in the marketplace today in the corporate services business? And where do you think that was say, two or three years ago? And as you look out over the next couple of years, what sort of aspirations or market share do you have? And where and how could M&A make sense there?","Chad Turner","So there\u2019s a simple question, a simple response to your first question, that\u2019s number one, two or three years ago, number one today and number one future, in terms of our positioning and where we are. So in terms of market share it\u2019s sort of at 20% range of the S&P, if you want to break it out further, it\u2019s about 50% of publicly listed tech companies. So we have a big penetration with folks who like our technology and understand the ease-of-use in the functionality that we can provide for them.","So that\u2019s a big driver of growth, for us is just being in that mindset in the set of companies who are \u2013 even the companies going public now being engaged with some of those early on as they put their plans together and then taking them public in participating in that growth go forward. So very good opportunities all across the Board and corporate services.","And then when I look at the future of the platform or what else we need to do. We don\u2019t really need to go out and acquire anything right, and when I\u2019ve talked about M&A and the space before, the difficulty is, when you go out and acquire it, because there are some participants in this space who historically offered stock plan administration services as an ancillary service to what they do in their core business. So there are a couple of companies who have rather large plans for public companies that you just wouldn\u2019t expect them to have a stock plan business.","Going after or trying to buy one of those would put us in the same situation where it would be a dislocation event. So I\u2019d sort of be loose to pay for something I\u2019m going to have to compete for, I\u2019d rather have my team be able to compete and win the way they have in the past. So unless there was a service or something that we could bolt-on more cost effectively than we can build it and our team and the tech space on this side can build pretty much anything, they work very closely with the plans.","So I don\u2019t \u2013 this is not a huge opportunity set for us, if something were to fall into our lap, we\u2019d absolutely take a look at it. But I really like our positioning here, I like what the team is doing to build this out go forward. It\u2019s just been a huge success story for us.","Michael Cyprys","Great. And just as a quick follow-up, maybe bigger picture. How are you thinking about the diversity of your revenue stream today relative to perhaps, or it\u2019s been in the past? And what sort of appetite is there for any sort of expansion into new verticals or new revenue streams?","Karl Roessner","Look, I think the diversity of revenue where we have real initiatives around fee-based product build within the \u2013 coming from the corporate services channel into the advisor referral, really expanding in the advisor services, you see the growth engines really in both corporate services and advisor services. The bank offers us a lot of potential and lot of that revenue will still be net interest, but it\u2019s coming from different product lines.","So in a sense it\u2019s a very different vertical, although it won\u2019t show on sort of the face of a pie chart of revenue categories, but it\u2019s coming from different places. All of that increases the strength of our earnings profile over time and through different market environments. I think you can see the strength in sort of this quarter\u2019s results against the market environment that we saw in the quarter and sort of the robustness of what we\u2019re bringing to market today.","Michael Cyprys","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to our presenters.","Karl Roessner","Well, thank you very much for joining us this evening. Enjoy the evening and we\u2019ll speak to you next quarter.","Operator","That does conclude the call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."]}}
