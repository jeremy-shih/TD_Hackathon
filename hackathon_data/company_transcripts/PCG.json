Welcome to PG&E Corporation 2017 First Quarter Conference Call. At this time, I would like to pass the call to Ann Kim. You may proceed, Ms. Kim.","Ann Kim - PG&E Corp.","Thank you, Mallory, and thanks to those of you on the phone for joining us. Before I turn it over to Geisha Williams, I want to remind you that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results, which is based on assumptions, forecasts, expectations and information currently available to management.","Some of the important factors that could affect the company's actual financial results are described on the second page of today's slide deck. The slide deck also includes a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q that will be filed with the SEC later today, and the discussion of risk factors that appears there and in our 2016 annual report.","With that, I'll hand it over to Geisha.","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Let me start off by saying how thrilled I am to be leading this iconic company. This is a time of great change and opportunity in the energy industry, and I'm proud that PG&E is helping to lead the way to a clean energy future.","This morning, I'm going to spend a few minutes reviewing our progress this past quarter with a focus on the three key objectives that I've set for the company, namely, building on our safety and operational performance, delivering on customer expectations, and positioning PG&E for success in the changing energy industry. After my remarks, I'll turn it over to Jason to walk us through the financials.","But before I begin, I want to acknowledge the tragic death of Zackary Randalls, a customer service representative who was killed in a random active shooter incident in Fresno on April 18. You know, Zack had only been with the company a few weeks, but had already established himself as a valued member of our team. Our hearts go out to Zack's wife, their two young children, as well as Zack's family, friends and co-workers in the Fresno community. This was a senseless act of violence that has deeply impacted the PG&E team and I thank you for allowing me a moment to recognize this terrible loss.","To start our business update this morning, I'd like to report on two major developments this past quarter in our continuing efforts to resolve the proceedings stemming from the San Bruno tragedy. First, on March 15, all parties in the shareholder derivative litigation reached a global settlement that resolved all claims. On April 21, the judge in the main derivative cases preliminarily approved the settlement, and scheduled a hearing for final approval on July 18. Second, on March 28, PG&E and the other active parties to the CPUC's Ex Parte investigation jointly submitted a settlement agreement to resolve the case through a combination of financial and non-financial remedies. If approved, these two settlements will move us substantially closer to resolving the San Bruno related legal matters.","With those updates, let me begin by talking about our first key objective, and that is building on the safety and operational performance that we've achieved. As you know, safety is our most important responsibility and highest value. We've previously reported on the improvements we're seeing in public safety performance, such as faster emergency response times and reductions in gas dig-ins. Well, I'm happy to report that we're also seeing positive trends in employee safety. Both our OSHA Recordable Injury (sic) [Incident] Rate and preventable Motor Vehicle Incident Rate are down 20% in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the same quarter of 2016. Even better, the number of serious motor vehicle incidents is down 65% this quarter as compared to the same period of last year. These improvements are especially notable given the tough weather conditions in which our employees had to work this past quarter, and they serve, frankly, as a testament to our employees' commitment to putting safety at the forefront of their work each and every day.","Speaking of the weather, as we shared last quarter, in 2016 we delivered the second best reliability in the company's history despite a record-setting winter storm season. Well, Mother Nature wasn't quite finished with us, and strong winds, heavy snow and rain continue to pound our service area over the last few months. The good news is that we've been able to minimize outage time for our customers. In fact, nearly 96% of the almost 2.5 million customers who experienced sustained outages during our January and February storms were restored within 24 hours.","Now, our strong performance can be credited to the tireless efforts of our employees, improvements in our emergency preparedness and response capabilities, and the investments we've been making over the years to modernize and upgrade our electric system. In the first quarter alone, we avoided more than 50 million customer outage minutes as a result of our investments in advanced grid automation and self-healing technology. As we continue to install this technology throughout our electric system, our customers will enjoy even greater reliability benefits in the future.","Of course, we can't talk about reliability without mentioning the significant outage we experienced in San Francisco on April 21. This outage was not weather-related, but was caused by a fire at one of our substations. We know this outage inconvenienced many of our customers, but thankfully, no public or employee injuries were reported as a result of the incident.","I'd like to highlight that we were already underway with a major $100 million upgrade to the substation, and we're also working closely with the City of San Francisco to address their questions in the wake of the outage.","I'd like to turn, now, to our second key objective, which is delivering on our customers' expectations. Our goal is to be our customer's provider of choice. We know that energy customers today want more options and more control, and that's driving us to focus on enhancing our customers' experience through continuous innovation and improvement throughout our business; and, we're pleased to see these efforts actually paying off.","For example, we recently received the results of our annual customer satisfaction survey for our gas transmission business, which showed the second highest rating in the 20-plus years we've conducted this survey. We also recently received EEI's 2017 Award for Outstanding National Key Accounts Customer Service. Votes for this award were cast in a nationwide open ballot by a pool of national commercial customers that include some of the country's largest, most sophisticated and most demanding energy consumers. We're proud of the progress we're making with customers and we've remained focus on continuing to improve the quality of our service.","As we continue to invest in our system to provide customers with the level of service they need and expect, we're also committed to affordability. Now, earlier this year, we announced $300 million in cost efficiency measures for 2017. I'm happy to report that we're on track to achieve the savings this year and, as we've mentioned before, this effort should be viewed as a first step in an ongoing focus on maintaining affordable service for our customers.","I'd like to turn, now, to our third key objective, positioning PG&E for success in the changing energy industry. To us, success goes hand in hand with enabling California's clean energy economy, a topic I'm particularly passionate about. With the fate of the Clean Power Plan in question, I've been getting inquiries about how we see the national political environment affecting our business strategies on clean energy here in California. We believe that, regardless of what happens at the federal level, California will continue to lead the way in transitioning to a clean energy economy and we are absolutely committed to remaining a key partner in the State's efforts.","As we think about California's Clean Energy Future, we know that some changes will be needed in regulations that mirror market changes that have taken place. So, for example, last week, PG&E, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric collectively filed an application at the CPUC proposing to update the mechanisms used to ensure a fair allocation of energy supply cost to those customers that choose to depart for either CCAs or Direct Access providers. We are proposing to replace the current mechanism, which is known as the PCIA, the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment and which, by the way, all parties agree is in need of reform, with an updated approach that more fairly allocates costs and benefits. As California continues to engage in discussions on the Utility of the Future, we view this as a foundational step for the continued growth of CCAs or other choices that our customers may have in the future.","Beyond energy supply, one of the most promising clean energy opportunities in California is electrification of the transportation sector. Transportation accounts for about 40% of California's GHG emissions. Governor Brown and the California Air Resource Board have both signaled their desire to see a dramatic increase in the number of zero emission vehicles in California. So, it's clear that electric vehicles will play a critical role in helping the State achieve its carbon reduction goals.","The CPUC's approval last December, we're actively kick starting our $130 million pilot, which, by the way, is the nation's largest utility infrastructure deployment to support charging of light duty EVs. At the same time, we're also continuing to work with innovative partners to pilot new programs, technologies and approaches in the EV space. So, for example, last December, we wrapped up Phase 1 of our smart charging pilot with BMW. Over the 18 months of the pilot, we were able to shift nearly 20 megawatt hours of charging in response to changing grid conditions. We're excited to support the next phase of this pilot, which will test the feasibility and the value of more active charge management.","So, to close, I want to reiterate my confidence in our future. We remain focused on continuing to deliver safety and operational excellence in meeting the needs of our customers and, at the same time, we are as committed as ever to working with the State to achieve its clean energy goals. We feel good about the opportunities this represents for PG&E and for our customers. Thank you for your time today.","And with that, let me turn it over to Jason to walk us through the financials.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Thank you, Geisha, and hello, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing the first quarter results, and then quickly cover the 2017 outlook.","Slide 4 shows our results for the first quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $1.06 per share. GAAP earnings, including the items impacting comparability, are also shown here. The pre-tax numbers for the items impacting comparability are in the table at the bottom of the page. Pipeline related expenses were $28 million pre-tax for the quarter. We incurred legal and regulatory related expenses of $4 million pre-tax. Fines and penalties were $60 million pre-tax for the quarter. This includes the planned $47 million related to the San Bruno penalty decision and disallowances imposed for ex parte communications in Phase 2 of the Gas Transmission and Storage rate case decision. We have now fully recognized the penalties imposed from these two decisions. This item also reflects a $13 million charge as a result of the settlement that we reached at the end of the first quarter in the Ex Parte Order Instituting Investigation. Butte fire related costs net of insurance were $3 million pre-tax and reflect legal cost associated with the fire.","Finally, we booked revenue of $150 million pre-tax for the quarter, which reflects a recognition of the gas transmission revenues in excess of our 2017 cost of service. We have now recognized all of the under-collected revenues associated with our 2015 Gas Transmission and Storage rate case.","On slide 5, you'll see our quarter-over-quarter comparison of earnings from operations of $0.82 in Q1 of last year, and $1.06 in Q1 of this year. We were $0.15 favorable as a result of the timing of the 2015 Gas Transmission and Storage rate case decision, which didn't allow us to recognize incremental revenues until the third quarter of 2016. This item is purely timing in nature and will reverse by year-end.","We were $0.06 favorable as a result of tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. There was an accounting standard change last year and we're now booking the tax impact of our annual equity compensation true up through earnings rather than equity.","Rate base earnings were $0.03 for the quarter. Miscellaneous items amounted to $0.05 favorable for the quarter, which includes tax timing differences that will reverse by year-end. In previous years, we had shown tax timing as a separate driver, but we don't expect the quarter-over-quarter changes to be as significant in 2017.","A delay in the timing of our 2017 GRC decision resulted in an unfavorable $0.03 for the quarter. This is primarily driven by incremental capital costs, such as depreciation and interest, without offsetting revenues. The driver for this particular $0.03 is timing, but as a reminder, we do expect that net impact of our 2017 GRC revenues and related costs to be roughly $0.25 negative for the year due to the loss of the incremental tax repair benefits. Additionally, if the proposed GRC decision is approved without modification, we'd expect to see an increase to rate base earnings of approximately $0.08 on an annualized basis. Finally, we had $0.02 negative for the increase in outstanding shares.","Transitioning, now, to slide 6, we are reaffirming our 2017 earnings from operations guidance of $3.55 per share to $3.75 per share. Our underlying assumptions are on page 7 and are consistent with what we shared last quarter. It remains our objective to earn the CPUC authorized return on equity across the enterprise as a whole.","Moving to slide 8, we have several updates to our 2017 items impacting comparability. First, with respect to our rights-of-way program, we had previously shared that the overall cost would not exceed $500 million. While the current year range for pipeline-related expenses is unchanged from last quarter, we're pleased that the overall cost of our rights-of-way program is now expected to range from $425 million to $475 million. We do, however, expect a small portion of the work will now fall into 2018 due to permitting challenges.","Second, as a result of the settlements we've reached in the ex parte investigation and the shareholder derivative lawsuits in the first quarter, we expect our legal and regulatory cost to come in around $10 million for the year. We had previously expected these costs to range from $10 million to $40 million.","Third, fines and penalties now reflect the $13 million in remedies settled as part of the ex parte investigation. The CPUC has not yet ruled on the settlement and the ultimate decision may modify this amount. We had previously expected fines and penalties to be roughly $45 million.","Finally, we've added a new item that reflects a settlement we reached in the shareholder derivative lawsuits. If the settlement is approved without modification, the impact would result in a gain of approximately $65 million net of certain legal expenses we agreed to pay on the plaintiff's behalf.","We are reaffirming our 2017 equity needs on slide 9 with a range of $400 million to $600 million. In 2018 and 2019, we still expect our equity needs to be met largely through our internal programs, which historically have been approximately $350 million annually.","On slides 10 and 11, we are reaffirming our CapEx and rate base guidance through 2019. I wanted to highlight one new item with potential upside to our capital plan. As new gas storage regulations are adopted, we'll need to invest capital in our system to comply with the new regulations. We should know more about the new regulations later this year.","Finally, we recently had a development in our cost of capital case. Last week, the proposed decision approving the all-party settlement was withdrawn from the CPUC's April 27 agenda. This was disappointing, particularly given the constructive efforts that went into the settlement in the proposed decision. We remain confident that the all-party settlement, which was developed with investor-owned utilities and consumer advocates, is in the best interest of our customers, and we look forward to working with the CPUC and settling parties to reach a timely resolution of this case. While we are not providing longer-term EPS guidance, it remains our objective to earn our CPUC authorized return on equity across the enterprise in 2018 and 2019.","I'll close by saying we're off to a strong start in 2017. We continue to have solid organic growth with expected capital spend totaling approximately $18 billion over the next three years. We're continuing to target above average dividend per share growth with a 60% dividend payout ratio by 2019. Combined, these factors make for an attractive total return.","So, with that, let's open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, hi. Good morning. Can you hear me okay?","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Yes.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Good morning, Steve. Yes.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Okay. Great. Just on the cost of capital case and delay, do you have any more color on why the CPUC delayed a ruling?","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Hi, Steve. This is Geisha. No, we really don't; not at this time. We still think it was a great settlement that took a long time to sort of hammer through. We think it's in the best interest of our customers, as Jason said. And, you know, the CPUC has a really long history of supporting settlements, especially all-party ones, so we remain optimistic that once we get better insights of what's the concern, if there is a concern, that we'll be able to get it approved.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And do you have any sense on when you might get more insight into that?","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Well, the ex parte ban was \u2013 for cost of capital was just lifted on Thursday. So, we are trying to meet with the Commissioners. We have filed for having an ex parte conversation and, as soon as we have those conversations, we'll have a better view; but, we have not had those conversations, yet.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. And then, one other question just \u2013 Jason, when you were going through the slide related to the, I guess, it was on the earnings, but you were talking to the GRC and kind of an $0.08 impact to rate base. I lost track on what you were saying there. This is back on slide 5, when you were talking to the timing of the GRC and what the potential proposed order would do.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Sure. Thanks, Steve. Generally, we would see growth in rate based earnings of about $0.05 a quarter on an annualized basis. This quarter, it's only $0.03 because we don't have a final decision in our GRC. And what I was pointing out is, once we've received that final decision, assuming it's voted out without modification, we'd expect to see an incremental $0.08 for the year in additional rate based earnings. So, this quarter, our growth in rate based earnings were slightly lower because we didn't have the final GRC decision.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, guys. Just on that last point, is the issue that as long as you don't have a decision, you'll continue to be about $0.02 shy of where you should be, and so the catch-up, when you do get a decision, is $0.08.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Yeah. Good morning, Jonathan. Yes. Yeah, that's the way to look at it is, for the full year, we expect this to be roughly $0.05 a quarter.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","The longer that we don't have a GRC decision, we will be short that $0.02 on a quarterly basis.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. I got it. Thank you. And then, could you give us a sense, Jason \u2013 I'm not sure how relevant this is given the balancing account, but there is lot of volatility in the tax line in this quarter. What is a sensible effective tax rate to be thinking about for the year?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","You know, I think our effective tax rate for the year is kind of roughly about 18%. It's hard to necessarily project a long-term effective tax rate. I'll say the driver for the low effective tax rate is mostly the flow through accounting treatment for tax repairs. And while our $6 billion of CapEx remains similar for each of the next three years, the composition of that spend does change year-over-year. And so, there will be changes for the portion of that capital spend that is eligible for tax repairs treatment. So, I wouldn't necessarily project that 18% effective tax rate for 2017, beyond 2017.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. But at least for this year, that's a reasonable number?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","It was slightly lower in the first quarter, given the discrete item that we had related to the stock-based compensation accounting change, but that's a reasonable expectation for the full-year.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Good morning, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I wanted to go back to slide 11, where you lay out some potential future updates, and I guess excluding the rate cases, there are a number of other items on that list. Could you expand a little bit on potential timing for us to be thinking about just an unusually large number of potential areas of future growth, and any color you can provide in terms of just how we could think about timing there?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Sure. I think most of the opportunities outside of the rate cases are longer-term in terms of rate base increases; but, to give some context, the new item that we highlighted, gas storage regulations, those final regulations should be issued this fall in 2017. We'll have to see those final regulations to see sort of the compliance period, but we'd expect that CapEx to begin shortly thereafter. So, it would start to impact 2018, 2019.","In terms of the future transportation electrification, we just filed for medium and heavy-duty vehicles back in late January. We're going to have to work through the CPUC process on that. So, again, I think, to the extent that we start to have spending in this sort of three-year time horizon, the rate base impact will probably be on \u2013 will be 2019 and beyond. And then, the State infrastructure modernization projects, those are really much longer term in nature. Those are probably projects over the next five years, seven years. So, hopefully that gives a little bit of color in terms of the timing of that spend and potential rate base increases.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. No, that's very helpful. Thank you. And then, just thinking about your overall cost structure, I know you all do a lot of work thinking about benchmarking your cost position and potential opportunities there. I just wanted to check in terms of progress of your work and the outlook, broadly speaking, in terms of what you might be able to do with your cost structure over time.","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Hi, Steven. This is Geisha. We're really focused on affordability, and part and parcel of that is taking a hard look at our cost structure. And as we mentioned, we had that announcement earlier this year with the $300 million efficiencies. That should be viewed very much as a first step, right. We are in a journey to continue to drive cost out of our business for our customers' affordability sake. So, you can expect to see more of that coming from us in the years to come.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. Is there a natural sort of cadence in terms of that, Geisha, or is it we'll just stay tuned and that's sort of constant, and so there is no natural point at which we would have a better sense of where you're headed?","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","No, absolutely. We have an integrated planning process that is very disciplined, very regimented, that's repeatable and very, very, very focused on really looking out five years at every given point in time. And so, you shouldn't expect a particular announcement, a particular sort of a discreet discussion around that, but just very much built into the way we're running the business, very much looking ahead. What do we need to do? How do we get there? What are the specific objectives and plans that we need to put in place? And part of that is a focus on affordability. So, it's just a natural part of the way we're running the business.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very good. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. You may proceed.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. Can you hear me?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Good morning, Julien.","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Yeah.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Excellent. So, just to follow up a little bit on the last question, if you can, expand a little bit on SB-887 and just the potential expansion on the safety-related spend, I suppose it is. Can you talk about what you're looking to get out of DOGGR as these rules are finalized? Like, as we see these rules announced and affirmed, what elements in particular are you looking to get clarity on that would drive the higher CapEx contemplated?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","There's sort of two principal parts to that regulation; one is sort of the incremental leak surveying and leak detection activities that will need to occur. That is primarily expense in nature. The other one will be sort of the well retrofits to make sure that we prevent unintended releases of methane, and that's really where sort of the capital costs will be driven. And ultimately, gas storage kind of as an industry has had its challenges, economically, and I think what we're working through with the regulations is just how significant those retrofits are in light of the need for storage in California and the need to prevent future unintended releases of methane. So I think we'll have to continue to follow that development. Like I said, I think we should see final regulations issued this fall here in 2017.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Excellent. And then, subsequently, on the TO case, is there any chance that you settle the 18 case at this point, and how should we think about outcomes in light of the latest court dynamics?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","We have a long history of settling the TO rate cases. I think we've settled essentially the first 17. This is a change. I would say that it's probably less likely than it has been in the past, but we're still open to settlement discussions, considering the appropriate terms.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Perhaps, if you can clarify on that, was the decision to move, or at least the period for settlement pass, was that prior, if I understand right, to the judicial outcome of late, and does that actually change the potential for a settlement at this point, given the less than clear policies at FERC?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","I mean \u2013 no, I don't directly \u2013 I wouldn't link the two. Ultimately, when \u2013 if we were to fully litigate this case, we would need a full set of Commissioners at FERC. But I wouldn't necessarily link the changes at FERC with settlement discussions on this case. But there are a number of California interveners that are challenging, essentially, the planning for the Transmission Owner-related spend. Essentially, about 40% of our Transmission Owner spend is approved by the Cal-ISO. The remaining 60% really relates to things like substation modifications and isn't necessarily in the purview of the Cal-ISO. I really think the focus on litigating this case is making sure that there is a full review of the entirety of the capital spend associated with our Transmission Owner rate case.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","So, sorry to belabor it, but to be very clear about this, in fact, what you're saying is it's principally an issue on exactly where capital is allocated rather than necessarily a stumbling block around return on equity. I mean, obviously, there is gradients in each, but would that be accurately capturing why you've been unable thus far to get that settlement done?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","I mean, I think it's one of the components, the planning, but certainly, our return on equity is a factor, as is depreciation rates; the typical challenges of any rate case process.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Excellent. I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Just a couple of questions. First of all, cash flow wise, do you anticipate seeing a pretty sizeable improvement in your cash flow metrics after 2017, given the fact that CapEx at the $6 billion is kind of flattish from 2017 levels?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Good morning, Michael. This is Jason. I wouldn't necessarily guide to that in 2018. We've got a number of factors that kind of work both ways, in addition to just sort of the annual volatility associated with commodity costs and recovery of our procurement costs.","One of the factors we see impacting our cash position here in this State is the incremental vegetation management work that we are pursuing as a result of the drought and bark beetles. The mechanism for recovery of those costs is generally about three years in nature. And so, while we see improvement in some areas of our cash flow, we see extending terms in other areas. So, I would really guide towards sort of longer-term financing needs to be driven by rate base as opposed to sort of underlying cash flows.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. I would just think that if rate base growth starts to slow down because CapEx flattens out, what normally happens is D&A gets recovered. So, that would drive kind of an improvement in long-term CapEx, unless rate base doesn't flatten.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","We are seeing that \u2013 a little bit of that improving, but as I mentioned to you, the incremental costs related to the drought and bark beetle are roughly $250 million annually. And as I said, that takes about three years to recover; so, we do see offsetting factors.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. One other thing, when you think about the upcoming electric TO cases, not the one that's underway, but for kind of the 2018, 2019 year, as well as the upcoming GT&S case, what do you see as the moving parts that could influence CapEx levels in either of those businesses?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","I really think it's going to come down to \u2013 we've ramped up over the last several years, particularly in light of pipeline replacement, substation modernization. I think those levels of safety-related investments and grid modernization are going to probably continue at sort of the current pace. I think, really, the upside that we see is continued movement, particularly on the State infrastructure modernization work. And I think it's going to be important to follow what happens with high-speed rail, in particular.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. You may proceed.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning. I wanted to jump to Steve's earlier question, I guess, with cost of capital, and you had the whitepaper published in the Commission, then it was withdrawn from the agenda. Is your expectation that the final order that's approved for the cost of capital is consistent with the settlement, or are you expecting changes from the settlement?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Good morning, Anthony. This is Jason. I think it's too early to speculate. As Geisha mentioned, and as I mentioned, we think that this was a very constructive settlement that we worked with consumer advocates to establish. We do think it was in the best interest of our customers, and so we're looking forward to understanding why the commission withdrew the proposed decision and, ultimately, working collaboratively to resolve this timely.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Okay. If the scenario occurred where the Commission tinkered with it or haircut it \u2013 the settlement was for two years. Is the utility able to pull out of it, if an order comes out that lowers it, but it's over a two-year period, like we don't want to be at risk of a longer-term cost of capital that's lower? Is that an ability to pull out of it, then?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","We would have the ability to comment on any proposed modifications to the settlement. Our focus is \u2013 we worked hard with all the interveners in the case with our sister utilities here in the State. We still think this is a very constructive settlement. And so, our intention is to understand any questions the Commission may have with respect to the settlement terms and work through the resolution of those questions with them.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Turnure with JPMorgan. You may proceed.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. I wanted to get an update on the Butte fire situation. If I remember correctly, there was a decision from the CPUC on that relatively recently. Kind of where are you now? What are the next steps on that?","John R. Simon - PG&E Corp.","Hi, Chris, this is John Simon. I'm the General Counsel here. You're right. Recently, the Safety and Enforcement Division of the CPUC issued two citations against PG&E, three violations; the total for $8.3 million. The bulk of the citations is SED's view that PG&E or its contractor failed to remove a tree that came into contact with our line. We're currently evaluating the citations. We have 30 days to do that. Our view is we need to evaluate it in the context \u2013 the overall context of the wild fire situation here in California, considering that we also have a comprehensive veg management program and we're in an extreme drought and, as Jason referred to, bark beetle situation. So that's where that is right now.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Are there any other things that we should be aware of there, kind of private litigation or anything that would kind of flow from that over the next couple of years?","John R. Simon - PG&E Corp.","At this point, no. It's too soon to say whether those citations would have any impact on liability or the litigation, but we're evaluating it now.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. That's all I had. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. You may proceed.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Follow-up question on the Butte fire. I recall you had given us an estimate of what you thought the total claims were going to be relative to your insurance coverage in the past. Can you update us on that? And also, can you explain, I think we've had a discussion about this, why we shouldn't think about sort of your maximum available insurance coverage as being sort of a number over which there would then be shareholder liability because your vendors also have insurance, which will be tapped to deal with those claims?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Thanks, Greg. This is Jason, and you're correct. Over the course of 2016, we've recorded an accrual for about $750 million related to claims associated with the Butte fire. That represented both property damage as well as the risk associated with personal injury claims. That continues to be our best estimate of the total accruals. We have yet to be in a position to estimate the high end of the range. We are still working through the details of the claims in that process, which will ultimately be a lengthy process.","That $750 million in total claims compares to about $900 million that we maintain in insurance. And as we've discussed in the past, sub-contractors actually execute this work and those sub-contractors maintain standard insurance associated for these activities. So, we would seek recovery, ultimately, from both our insurers as well as our subcontractors' insurers, if \u2013 for the claims associated with the Butte fire.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. So, to think about the math, once we come up with a total number in terms of claims, that would then have to be absorbed by some combination of what their insurance ultimately pays for and what your insurance ultimately pays for. And so, the totality of your insurance coverage is not necessarily the arbiting factor on when or if the equity (40:04), correct?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","That's correct. Yeah.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. You may proceed.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Hi, guys.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Good morning.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. First question I had was on CCAs, and you've talked about a new proposal. Just wanted to understand any key points in the new proposal and how that helps reduce risk as more migration happens towards CCA going forward?","Steven E. Malnight - PG&E Corp.","Hi. This is Steve Malnight from our Strategy and Policy team. So, let me field that one. I think it's important to remember, first, when CCAs really formed, and as the legislature has continued to reinforce, the legislative intent here is that, when a customer or community chooses to go CCA, the customers who remain PG&E bundled customers should be indifferent to that choice. In other words, any costs that were borne in our energy supply portfolio for those customers who eventually choose to go CCA, they should take those \u2013 their share of those costs with them so that customers who remain behind are indifferent. The mechanism that the Commission has put in place to accomplish that, as Geisha said, was the PCIA. And that mechanism, over time as CCAs have grown, has become more distorted. It's not as effective at fully passing through those costs.","So, what we see today is that about 65% of the costs actually are passed through to customers who go CCA and the rest remain with our bundled customers. Now, that was not a significant issue when CCAs were really small and served a small portion of the load, but we're currently forecasting that by the end of this year they'll be at 13% and growing to 38% by 2020. So, in order to really build a sustainable future for those CCAs and for other choices, as Geisha mentioned, we've got to make sure we put in place the right foundational mechanism.","So, the PAM \u2013 the difference in the PAM versus the PCIA is that it uses \u2013 rather than using administratively set benchmarks to try and value the portfolio that we have put together, it uses actual market prices with true up mechanisms. And importantly, going forward, when \u2013 under the PCIA, when a customer departs, they bear their portion of the costs, but they receive no benefits from the portfolio we've currently accrued. And under the PAM, the renewable attribute to the portfolio we've accrued and the resource adequacy would actually be transferred over to the CCA for them to use in their portfolio to continue to serve customers.","So, using the combination of transferring benefits and using market prices, we feel the PAM is a better way to really value the current portfolio and assure those costs are evenly shared. And in doing that, we build the foundation for continued growth.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. That makes sense. And clearly, the allocation of cost, like you said, would be much more fair. The question, then, is, given the quick migration \u2013 or an increased migration to CCAs, if this process takes time, what kind of risk do you foresee if it takes a few years for this entire change to go through?","Steven E. Malnight - PG&E Corp.","Well, I think the plan in the proposal in the PAM application is that the PCIA would be fully replaced by PAM. So, for customers, as CCA growth continues, any customers or any communities that have gone CCA would shift over to the PAM mechanism, which would enable us to fully allocate those costs.","Having said that, I think you're right. There is a pretty rapid transition happening in the State and I think we've made it pretty clear to folks that we think it's important that we act on this PAM application quickly so that communities that are considering going CCA in the future will have the best information available to make that decision. So, we're urging the Commission to move quickly here and we hope that they take us up on that.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Thanks. And then, just quickly, Jason, on the effective tax rate, the tax repair clearly is a key component that helps, as you said, keep the tax \u2013 effective tax rate low at around 20%. How do we estimate that going forward as in \u2013 clearly, 2017 you talked about, but going forward, what proportion should we kind of think about is the tax repair piece, so that we can kind of model the more long-term rate?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","We're not providing any component detail on guidance beyond 2017. The tax repair treatment will continue to exist in 2018. That is the driver for why we're so much lower than the statutory rate, and you'll have to make your assumptions around how that changes over time. Let me just reinforce the point that, while our CapEx is relatively constant at $6 billion, the composition of that CapEx changes annually and, therefore, the components that are eligible for tax repairs does change. So, while we would expect our effective tax rate to be below the statutory rate, we're not providing specific guidance beyond 2017.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Fair enough. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. You may proceed.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey, guys, good morning.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Good morning.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Most of my questions were answered. Just real quick, is there any updates on Senate Bill 618 and how that can sort of play into your CCA filings?","Steven E. Malnight - PG&E Corp.","We don't have any update for you at this time. I think, as we know, there is a lot of activity happening both in Sacramento and at the PUC around CCA, retail choice, how we want to structure the markets for the future. And I think we're going to continue to advocate for, as we said with the PAM application, that we build the right foundation and that we continue the discussion over time about where the State wants to go.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Is there an opportunity for Senate Bill 618 to transition ahead of your CCA filing?","Steven E. Malnight - PG&E Corp.","I don't think that that would likely happen. I mean, I think at the end of the day, we've got the application in front of the Commission and, under most circumstances, I think it's going to be up to the PUC to really set the right cost allocation mechanisms to ensure that we have a fair transition. And as I said, as I think the legislature said in multiple bills, the idea of customer indifference, so that a customer who remains behind with the utility is indifferent to the choice another customer may make, that's really a foundational concept for any kind of continued choice expansion. And I think that will continue to be the case.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar Capital Group. You may proceed.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc.","Good morning, thank you.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Good morning.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc.","As it relates to the EV and, even more broadly, the whole retail discussion, what's the possibility that you would enter some kind of competitive business in that space versus all the regulated investment you've talked about?","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Hi, this is Geisha. I don't know. I mean, I think that's something that we'd have to really think about. We believe, as an infrastructure company, which is what we are, we're really in a great position to put in the make-ready and the EV charging stations to really accelerate the adoption of EVs. Looking beyond a regulatory play, we have to really take a look at the economics and the financing and the whole nine yards to see whether that really makes sense for us. Today, we think it really is an integral and important part of the regulated business here in California.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc.","Okay. And on a separate subject, the gas transmission midstream in general, if I'm looking at that CapEx number, what component of that would be any kind of growth in transmission? I know you've talked about the storage, obviously have the safety stuff. What portion of that 2017 to 2019 is growth? And then, the follow on to that would be, as you look out 2020 and beyond, are there growth opportunities in the gas transmission area, specifically?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","I would really look at very little of it to be growth in terms of gas throughput on the system. Generally speaking, we're seeing flat throughput on the system sort of currently to declining as the State continues to pursue higher and higher renewable portfolio standards. So, I would see the driver behind that gas transmission growth is less around new capacity, but more about replacement and improving the safety of our existing system.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc.","And could you foresee that changing at all in the next, call it, five years, even 10 years down the road?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","No. I see the pattern of CapEx being driven by safety enhancements being the primary driver. I don't see capacity in the next five years \u2013 new capacity in the next five years being a driver of CapEx.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc.","Okay. Great. I appreciate it.","Ann Kim - PG&E Corp.","All right. We have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay. Our last question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. You may proceed.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Hi. How are you doing?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Good morning.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just really \u2013 most of my questions have been answered, but there has been some press on Diablo Canyon and I was wondering if you could sort of respond to some of their \u2013 some of the more pointed editorials about the cost associated \u2013 just gives us an update in terms of how that looks and your thoughts about it?","Steven E. Malnight - PG&E Corp.","So, this is Steven Malnight, again. I think that we hit an important milestone in the Diablo Canyon retirement proceeding at the Commission. We completed our \u2013 about two weeks of testimony. During that time, we talked about and gave details on all the different components of the proposal, including how we're going to replace Diablo with GHG-free resources, the energy efficiency procurement that we're proposing to do along with the community payments \u2013 the payments to our employees to make sure we retain the effective and safe workforce, and the costs for \u2013 that we've incurred for re-licensing.","So, I think we've covered those issues throughout the proceeding. We feel very good about the case we put forward. It's really a comprehensive proposal that looks at all of the various stakeholders that are needed in order to ensure we continue to operate the plant safely through the rest of its life, that we take advantage of the great greenhouse-gas-free energy that it produces until it retires, and then we have an orderly and effective transition to new GHG-free resources. So, we continue to be very supportive of that proposal and we think it will \u2013 as we advocate for it through the Commission proceeding, we're optimistic that we can keep that moving forward.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you.","Ann Kim - PG&E Corp.","All right. Thanks to everyone for joining us this morning.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to introduce your host, Chris Foster, Senior Director of Investments with PG&E. Thank you and enjoy your conference. You may proceed Mr. Foster.","Chris Foster","Thank you, Keira, and thanks to those of you on the phone for joining us. Before I turn it over to Geisha Williams, I want to remind you that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements about our financial outlook which are based on assumption, forecasts, expectations and information currently available to management. Some of the important factors that could affect the company's actual financial results are described in the second page of today's fourth quarter earnings call presentation.","The presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures. We also encourage you to review the 2017 annual report on Form 10-K that will be filed with the SEC late today and the discussion of risk factors that happens there. With that, I'll hand it over to Geisha.","Geisha Williams","Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. I know that the Northern California wild fires continue to be top of mind and I will spend the majority of my remarks on that topic today. I will also touch on the progress we continue to make in our core operations including improving our ability to prepare for and response to potential wildfires. Finally, I will address how we are developing and implementing innovative solutions that both better serve our customers and help to advance California's clean energy goals. Jason will then address tax reform impacts followed by a walk through the financial results for the quarter.","The record wildfires both in Northern and Southern California have had an extraordinary impact. They were absolutely tragic for the communities and families who lost loved ones and property and who continue to be in our thoughts as we support their recovery. They have had profound financial and economic consequences for the state and of course they have significantly impacted the utilities. At this point, Cal Fire is continuing its investigations and we still don\u2019t have a conclusion on the causes of the fires. But across the state there is a growing recognition that we need comprehensive solutions and that we have to think differently about how we prevent, how we respond to and recover from wild fires, as well as the importance of infrastructure resilience.","Governor Brown has acknowledged this in his public comments. So have members of the legislature and so had CPUC President Picker and other CPUC commissioners. We all recognized that California is facing a new normal when it comes to climate threats. I couldn\u2019t agree more and looking ahead we understand these challenges aren't going away, we have to adapt. That includes working together to manage and mitigate climate risk. It includes looking at how we plan future investment and it includes ensuring that our state infrastructure is more resilient. More immediately, it requires changes in operating practices which I will touch on in a minute.","Our communities need physical infrastructure that can withstand this new environment and rebound quickly. And we also need the policy infrastructure that facilitates our ability to recover from these events as well. It's bigger than just PG&E and the other California IOUs and much bigger than just this past year's fires. This is a collective societal challenge. For example, it has a direct impact on the state's ability to meet its build clean energy goals. The Northern California wild fires last year resulted in the equivalent of a full year of vehicle emissions in California over the course of just a few days. This simply isn't sustainable.","Our commitment is that we are going to work together with leaders in the state and our communities, our customers, our regulators, our fellow utilities and others to find solutions. Of course it's complex. But in one sense this is nothing new for us or our partners. Together we have tackled big, complex challenges for decades, be it system wide rebuilding codes and system code modifications following the Loma Prieta earthquake. Reaching the state's target for 33% renewables three years early while also improving reliability. Or just recently, the joint proposal that was approved to safely retire our Diablo Canyon nuclear facility while replacing its carbon-free base load power with clean energy resources.","In the meantime, I want to acknowledge upfront the impact the wild fires have had on our shareholders as well. In particular, we know the dividend suspension was difficult news for our long-term investors, so let me speak to that. I want to emphasize what we said at the time of the announcement. The decision was not the result of any new information about causes of the fires. As I noted earlier, those investigations are ongoing and maybe for quite some time. The decision was driven by the level of uncertainty about the potential causes and liabilities associated with the fires.","Ultimately the board and management with the support of independent advisors determined that suspension of the dividend was the prudent and appropriate course of action under these difficult and uncertain circumstances. We recognize the importance of dividends to our investors and we intend to revisit the issue as we get more clarity on any potential liability. The board has the appropriate flexibility to reinstate the dividend if we are able to narrow the current broad range of potential exposure and uncertainty. Until then, we are sure that this issue is top of mind for the board and the management team and we continue to re-evaluate this on a regular basis.","As many of you already know, the biggest factor underlying the current uncertainty is California's application of inverse condemnation to investor-owned utility. This establishes that a utility maybe strictly liable for damages and legal fees if their equipment is found to have been the substantial cause of an event such as a wild fire, even if a company acted reasonably. It effectively makes utilities the default insurers for wild fire risks, shifting the cost to our shareholders with no assurance of rate recovery. This is simply bad public policy.","We believe the legal theory behind is severely flawed and we are challenging it aggressively on three fronts. In the regulatory, legal and legislative arenas. From a regulatory perspective, we have requested a re-hearing of the CPUC in the San Diego Gas and Electric Company's wild fire cost recovery proceeding. On the legal side, we filed a motion about a month ago. There we have asked the trial court in the Butte wild fire case to reconsider its interpretation of the application of inverse condemnation given the CPUC's decision in the SDG&E case. We have a hearing that\u2019s been set for March 15 when we will provide our arguments.","And finally, we are informing law makers as part of a broad effort to tackle what is ultimately a societal issue of climate change and the holistic solutions that must be addressed. This includes improved resiliency for California as it relates to extreme climate driven events and we believe part of that solution must involve rationalizing the application of inverse condemnation. In the short-term, action is needed now before we experience another fire season. And over the long-term not addressing this issue has grave implication to the industry's financial health and our ability to attract affordable capital needed not only for California to meet it's clean energy goals but for us to continue to deliver on our priorities of safe, reliable, affordable and clean energy for our customers.","Let me transition now to our core operations. I am really pleased to share that just morning we along with the joint parties announced that we will not seek re-hearing of the CPUC's decision on the Diablo Canyon power plant joint proposal and that we will be withdrawing our license renewal application at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. This is a huge milestone. And as I have mentioned earlier, an example of what can be accomplished through partnership and coalition.","Looking back now to 2017, I am really proud of how our employees stepped up during what was really a challenging year. We have just come through a year with record breaking rains, record breaking heat waves, record number of dead or dying trees, all culminating in the most destructive wildfires we have ever seen. As a result, I want to acknowledge the incredible focus and dedication of our employees. In 2017, our teams worked an incremental 1 million hours or a 50% increase above our historical norm in support of our customers and communities while continuing to advance our grid modernization efforts.","Looking ahead as I mentioned, action is needed now prior to another wild fire season in our state and so we are aggressively moving forward with our 2018 wild fire season plan, as well as some customer focused specific efforts in the impacted areas in the North Bay. As you can imagine, our planning is also focused on fire resiliency which will be reflected in our 2020 GRC. We have already taken specific actions that will continue to execute on at a system level for 2018.","They include, first, in high risk wild fire areas disabling all distribution system remotely controlled re-closures on high risk [dates] [ph]. And disabling manually operated re-closures throughout the wild fire season. Second, expanding use of weather stations in forecasting modeling. Third, expanding our already extremely comprehensive vegetation management practices, and fourth, working collaboratively with first responders and others to evolve our pre-staging and emergency response capability. And we have already implemented new protocols for de-energizing our lines, a highly complex issue.","Just as important, we are moving forward now on engaging the impacted local communities. The families and core local government officials as part of the rebuild North Bay are ready to tackle creative solutions that reflect California's ability to move quickly with technology based advances. And we will be right there with them. We will be working with the communities to see where new system design and operational improvements can be executed quickly. We will be looking at non-wood poles, high definition cameras and new inspection techniques, as well as deploying micro-grid solutions that fit their specific needs.","Across the enterprise, we remain focused on executing operational goals that form the foundation of our company in the next few years. And to that end, we are also not letting up on pursuing projects that will keep California at the forefront of clean energy policy. I will highlight two areas that we are looking at in 2018, both of which I am particularly excited about. First is a project in Oakland. The areas surrounding the Port of Oakland are undergoing exciting changes under the leadership of Mayor Schaaf and other local leaders. We are contributing to that vision as well through what we call the Oakland clean energy initiative. This is a proposal to provide the California independent system operator or CAL ISO with a really creative clean energy solution.","We filed an alternative to replace an aging fossil fueled fire power plant with state of the art clean energy through a portfolio of energy efficiency and distributed generation resources that will provide reliable power to Oakland and other communities throughout the Bay area. It's ground breaking because when it's approved, the proposal would mark the first time that local clean energy resources are proactively deployed instead of fossil fueled generation for transmission reliability at this scale. It's big. And just last week, the CAL ISO staff included the approval of this project in their draft transmission plan which is a key step in moving this forward. We see this as a preview of what the future of energy will look like. It's a great example of what we can do for our communities and our economy when we work together to come up with innovative solutions. And we are looking at opportunities to push the envelope in other areas as well.","In addition, we see tremendous opportunity to partner in helping to meet the state's carbon reduction goals in the electric vehicle space. Governor Brown recently issued a zero emission vehicle executive order which sets a goal of having 5 million zero emission vehicles on California's roads by the year 2030. Our energy infrastructure and nearly 80% GHG-free electric portfolio are key enablers of meeting this goal and we look forward to working with the states in achieving it. We are already implementing our EV charge network and in the coming quarter we hope to receive approval for the $250 million filing we made early last year. This request moves beyond the light duty vehicles and looks at medium and heavy duty electrification technologies and even school bus electrification for our communities.","These efforts, really using our planning and engineering expertise to push for clean energy solutions while testing and evaluating new vehicle electrification efforts, represent just a portion of our commitment to advancing carbon reduction goals for California. So before I turn it over to Jason, I want to reiterate that we are aggressively pursuing all avenues to address the application of inverse condemnation to investor-owned utilities. This is a critical issue that must be resolved and I can assure you that we will continue to take a lead role in addressing it. At the same time, we haven't lost sight of our core operations. Providing safe, reliable and affordable service and offering innovative solutions for our customers continues to be our mission each and every day. And finally, we look forward to partnering across the state to tackle climate change impacts and in the meantime, proactively addressing system resiliency to mitigate the impact of future events.","As I said earlier, this is much bigger than just PG&E. But we recognize that we play a key role in helping to meet our state's clean energy goals and we are excited about the opportunity that represents for both our customers as well as our shareholders. With that, I will turn it over to Jason to walk you through the financials before we take your questions.","Jason Wells","Thank you, Geisha and good morning everyone. First, I would like to address 2018 guidance.","Given the uncertainty stemming from the October 2017 Northern California wild fires, we will be not be providing 2018 earnings per share guidance on today's call. We will revisit it as we have better clarity into potential liabilities, if any, related to the Northern California wild fires. I will, however, be addressing CapEx and rate-based guidance for 2018 and 2019, as well as sharing how we are thinking about at equity. I want to emphasize that this guidance assumes no additional impact from the October 2017 Northern California wild fires beyond what we are providing on today's call.","So today I will start by covering the expected impacts from tax reform and then transition to our fourth quarter results. Slide four outlines the expected impacts from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law in December. Income taxes are a significant component of our cost of service so we expect tax reform changes to provides benefits for our customers in the long-run and we also expect these changes to generate higher rate based growth for our shareholders.","There are also impacts to PG&E cash flows and financing needs as well as a transition charge we recorded in the fourth quarter. I will talk about those in a minute. But first I want to emphasize that we are very early in the overall implementation of tax reforms. Our guidance reflects best expectations today but there is work to be done if we get all the details ironed out and ultimately the CPUC will need to authorize how and when tax reform is implemented. In early January we informed the CPUC that we would file our plan to implement tax reform by the end of March.","On the GRC side, we are already required to track the impact of tax law changes memo account for disposition in the 2020 GRC. Our filing in March would accelerate that time. In terms of the impact on revenues, we anticipate that the revenue we collect from our customers will be reduced by approximately $500 million annually as a result of the lower corporate tax rate. While this revenue reduction will be effective starting in 2018, the actual bill impact maybe lower in the first year as we await CPUC approval on the implementation plan.","From a federal cash tax payment perspective, we won't see any immediate benefits due to our net operating loss. And while the lower corporate tax rate will reduce federal tax payments in the long run, the elimination of bonus depreciation accelerates the amortization of our net operating loss carried forward. This results in PG&E becoming a federal cash tax payer in 2020, which is a year earlier then our previous expectations of 2021. Based on the combination of these drivers and in particular the elimination of bonus depreciation, we expect ratebase will be about $500 million more in 2018 and then an incremental $300 million more in 2019, for a cumulative total of $800 million more over the next two years.","Through 2019 we now expect ratebase growth of approximately 7.5% to 8% annually compared to the 6.5% to 7%, we shared on our third quarter call. Beyond 2019, while we expect ratebase to grow at a higher rate as a result of tax reform, the incremental growth will begin to slow given that bonus depreciation was already scheduled to end in 2020 under the previous law. So stepping back, from an overall cash perspective we anticipate that tax reform on a net basis will drive incremental equity needs of roughly $200 million more in 2018 and 2019 for a total of $400 million more over the next two years. I will talk more about equity in a bit.","And while we are not providing earnings guidance today, we would expect an increase in earnings from operations consistent with the change in ratebase. Finally, in the fourth quarter we did record a onetime charge of $147 million after tax, which reflects the reevaluation of the holding company's net operating loss and deferred tax assets at the utility that fall outside of regulation for things such as disallowed plant. This charge is reflected as an item impacted comparability in our fourth quarter results. In summary, while we need to work through the regulatory process, it is clear that tax reform is going to drive long term benefits to our customers and also drive higher ratebase growth, financing needs and earnings.","Slide 5 shows our results for the fourth quarter. Earnings from operations on a per share basis came in at $0.63. GAAP earnings including the items impacting comparability are also shown here. Cost associated with the Northern California wild fires totaled $82 million free cash and included reinstatement of our insurance as well as legal and other costs. For the Butte fire, we recorded legal expenses of $15 million pretax. Pipeline related expenses were $12 million pretax for the quarter. Our legal and regulatory related expenses came in at $2 million pretax.","Moving on to Slide 6, which shows quarter over quarter comparison from earnings from operations of $1.33 in Q4 last year and $0.63 in Q4 this year. We were $0.33 unfavorable due to the timing of the final phase two decision in the 2015 GT&S rate case which was received in December of 2016. This fully reverse the favorable year-to-date variance for a net impact of zero for the full year. Timing of taxes was $0.18 unfavorable, also resulting in a zero net impact for the full year. Due to the loss of the incremental tax repair benefits as part of the 2017 GRC decision, we were $0.09 unfavorable.","We were $0.06 unfavorable due to the timing of operational spend. As we mentioned on the third quarter call, we have bundled some of our work to execute it more efficiently which created a delay in some of our expend from Q3 to Q4. In the fourth quarter of 2016 we received a customer energy efficiency incentive award with no similar amount in 2017, resulting in $0.02 unfavorable. Share dilution resulted in $0.02 negative for the quarter. Miscellaneous items totaled $0.05 unfavorable for the quarter and primarily reflect the reversal of certain timing related items.","Offsetting these unfavorable variances were favorable rate base earnings of $0.05 for the quarter. Slide 7 outlines our capital expenditure, authorized rate base and cost of capital assumptions for 2018. We have also provided a few additional factors that could impact our results for the year in a lower rate quarter, which we expect will largely offset each other. While we are not providing earnings per share guidance for 2018, on an earnings from operations basis, our objective is to earn the CPUC authorized 10.25% return on equity across the enterprise.","Turning to Slide 8. The guidance for items impacting comparability reflects a range of $100 million to $170 million pretax. Pipeline related expenses are expected to fall between $35 million and $60 million pretax and reflect the final amounts we plan to incur under this program. We expect the total program spend to fall within our previously disclosed range of $450 million to $475 million. We have estimated a range of $30 million to $60 million pretax for legal cost associated with the Butte fire. This range does not include any estimate for claims related costs.","Northern California wild fire cost net of insurance are expect to range between $35 million and $50 million. This includes an estimate of legal and other cost of $100 million to $150 million, partially offset by insurance recoveries of $65 million to $100 million. These estimates do not assume any amounts for claim related costs. Transitioning now to Slide 9. Our capital expenditure plans through 2019 are consistent with what we disclosed in the third quarter with plan spend of approximately $6.3 billion in 2018 and roughly $6 billion in 2019.","Moving to Slide 10. As I previously mentioned, our rate base now reflects the impact of tax reform with a growth rate of roughly 7.5% to 8% annually through 2019. This also incorporates the 2019 gas transmission storage rate case that we filed last November. Slide 11 outlines how we are thinking about usage and sources of equity for the next couple of years. We previously shared that we expected our equity needs for 2018 and 2019 to largely be met through our internal programs which have generated approximately $300 million to $400 million annually over the last several years. This was primarily to support our CapEx programs and rate based programs.","Additionally, as I shared earlier, tax reform increases our equity needs by roughly $200 million in both 2018 and 2019. And our items impacting comparability also drive incremental equity requirements. As we think about our equity plans with the dividend suspension, we do plan to continue issuing equity under our internal programs. However, with our dividend suspended, the dividend reinvestment program has been halted so we expect a decrease in the amount of equity these programs will generate. With that said, we expect our current equity needs will be covered as a result of the dividend suspension. But as Geisha mentioned earlier, the board is committed to revisiting the dividend decision as greater clarity is reached and also resuming a more normal financing approach.","Finally, the cash that we are conserving as a result of the dividend suspension, is reducing our financing needs and creating an equity cushion that if needed, could ultimately be used for any potential liabilities that result from the Northern California wild fires. In closing, I want to reiterate that we fully recognize what a challenging few months this has been for our shareholder community both with the uncertainty generated by the Northern California wild fires and the decision to suspend our dividend in December. As Geisha shared, we are working hard to address the challenges that inverse condemnation raises for both our customers and our shareholders. And you have our commitment that as material facts unfold, we will keep you apprised of the progress. So with that, let's open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.","Jonathan Arnold","Thank you for the update. A question on -- you obviously, I guess, will see more discussion in the 10-Q but you haven't taken any incremental reserves against the Butte fire this quarter, I think. Is that correct?","Jason Wells","That is correct.","Jonathan Arnold","And in the last quarter you had said, you didn\u2019t have enough information to determine the high end because there were large number of claims you didn\u2019t know enough about, I think. So is that still the case or is the fact that you are not taking a charge a reflection of your view of the strength of your legal position and the challenge you filed in front of the court. I was just curious if you could give us some sense of what's driving the sort of reserving policy there.","Jason Wells","Sure. Well, we continue to make progress settling some of the cases in the fourth quarter. We still don\u2019t have detail for about 25% of the total claims related to the Butte fire. But also importantly, as Geisha mentioned, we feel strongly about the strength of our challenge. The application of inverse condemnation as it relates to investor-owned utilities. And so we need both further clarity as it relates to claims data as well as progress on a legal front.","Jonathan Arnold","In order to sort of have a probable number you could estimate, is that the right way to think? So it is no more probable or estimable than it was last quarter, is that where we are, Jason?","Jason Wells","That\u2019s correct. We still feel that the $1.1 billion that we have accrued so far for the Butte related fire to be appropriate.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. And then just one other on this co-area, if possible. So it sounds like you are saying that whatever you said about equity before, you now see the dividend suspension covering that in the next couple of years. Have I understood that right? And just the...","Jason Wells","We didn\u2019t give any guidance on the length of the dividend suspension. What we try to provide was just the underlying drivers of our base equity needs. You will have to make an assumption about any potential liabilities, any arising from the Northern California wild fires as well as the length of the dividend suspension.","Jonathan Arnold","No. Sure. I wasn\u2019t getting of that. But I think you did say that you felt that given what you laid out as the current needs, that would fall under the amount of equity created by the dividend suspension and you are turning off the drip. So there is really not going to be very much issuance under internal programs for the time being. Is that fair?","Jason Wells","We will continue issuing under the internal programs but with the dividend suspended we expect less from the drip. The drip has historically contributed roughly $60 million a year to our internal equity needs. That combination of continuing to issue under the internal programs coupled with the suspension of the dividends provides us sufficient financing for our ongoing capital.","Jonathan Arnold","So $60 million of the drip component of the 300 to 400 roughly?","Jason Wells","That\u2019s correct. Yes.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just on -- so it feels like the commission has kind of somewhat encouraged the idea that you would want to address inverse condemnation in the court. And you talked about building an equity cushion against any charges on the 2017 fires. Is there a case to be made that you might request some kind of waiver from the 52% equity? You felt that the inverse condemnation discussion was still pending and live but you are right up to the point where you did need to take a charge. I am just curious kind of if that\u2019s something you could even do or if you think it would be a good idea.","Jason Wells","Well, I appreciate the question, Jonathan. I mean right now we still don\u2019t even have the cause of the fires, so it premature to talk about sort of potential liability and courses of action. That being said, we do have the file waiver with the CPUC if we believe we will be out of compliance with our regulated capital structure.","Jonathan Arnold","Has that something you have ever done before with success or?","Jason Wells","We actually have filed that as part of the energy prices but it was never ruled on by the commission given they ultimately disposed off the overall resolution of the bankruptcy proceeding.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.","Steve Fleishman","So first just, I am not sure if you can answer this, but should we expect to get any more color on the claims that have been filed for the Northern California fire in your 10-K?","John Simon","Good morning. It's John Simon. I am the General Counsel here. We do discuss the number of claims and there they are filed and briefly the status of where we are in those cases. There has been, just to highlight this for you, about 107 or so complaints filed against PG&E. We don\u2019t know if they have all been served by the way, but we know they have been filed. They have been coordinated in the San Francisco superior court and at this point there is a -- I believe there is a case management conference coming up towards the end of February. That\u2019s the point where we will learn a little bit more about what the procedure is going forward. But that\u2019s about where we are.","Steve Fleishman","How about the dollar value?","John Simon","We don\u2019t have much insight into the dollar value at this point. We do know that those complaints are asserting for the most part either property damage claims under inverse or personal injury claims under negligence. And that\u2019s about all we know. Very early on.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. When would we likely get more info on the dollar value of claims.","John Simon","Honestly, I think that\u2019s going to be a while. So right now those cases are at the very early stages of procedure and process. There is no schedule set. I think over the course of discover, which again hasn\u2019t even no schedule set on that, over the course of the next year, year and half or so, we might get more visibility into it but it's hard to know for sure.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. My other question is just on, I am sure you all listen to the commission's session related to, I think director at the financial community this week. And I guess my sense on the takeaway from that is that they don\u2019t have any understanding there is a potential crisis here for the investor-owned utilities as you are going to have to have to take on all these costs under inverse with if you did cause the fires and so I guess I would curious your take of that but more importantly, what are you doing to make sure they understand how bad this could be and that the implications it has? Or do they understand it and they are just not communicating it given all their rules.","Steve Malnight","This is Steve Malnight. I wanted to say, I think we were also disappointed with the comments and the tone from the webinar earlier this week. You think it's important to put it in a little bit context. First of all you mentioned this was the rules that were applied against that discussion. Clearly, it was a little bit of a new forum for them and they were very cautious about delving into anything that could be an ex parte, so there wasn\u2019t really discussions about inverse or other things. And when you look at the broader suite of comments from the commissioners, I think looking at the San Diego WEMA case with President Picker and Commissioner Guzman Aceves concurrence where they clearly noted that the logic for applying inverse condemnation in investor-owned utilities was unsound and they urged the legislature and courts to address the issue.","I think there is some context in other places where there is maybe more recognition than was shown in that discussion. So I think from our perspective, we are taking every opportunity available to not only talk to the commission and the commissioners but also really all the policy makers across California and Sacramento and others. As Geisha said, this is a bigger challenge than just the investor-owned utilities. It's bigger challenge than just PG&E and it really calls for a significant and comprehensive state-wide solution. So we are very active in every place we can be to share that message and to explain that. We are also partnering with the other investor-owned utilities, labor and other interested parties in seeking out comprehensive solutions. So we are going to continue to work that hard and take every opportunity we can.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.","Stephen Byrd","I wanted to just talk about the process, I think Geisha had mentioned there will be hearing on March 15. I wondered if it would be possible to get some sense for the process and timeline after that hearing. How we should think about that case playing out, and I guess it depends on ultimately the decision made by the court on that. But just curious if you could give a little more color around how to think about next steps after that hearing.","John Simon","Sure, Steven. John Simon. You know, the hearing as you mentioned is scheduled for March 15. We filed briefs. There is briefing schedule which I don\u2019t know of the top of my head leading up to that hearing. We don\u2019t know at that hearing what actually is going to happen. There is options. The judge may rule right then and there. He may listen to arguments and then set some sort of time table after that. So it's really hard to know and I wouldn\u2019t want to speculate on what the judge is going to do there. Several have asked about, so what happens after that. You know whomever looses that motion, whether it's the plaintiffs, I will speak for PG&E, if we lose that motion we would then expect to seek permission from the court of appeals to appeal that decision. That\u2019s an appeal that isn't automatically granted but we would file papers asking for permission to purse that appeal. There is a timeline on that. It's a little unpredictable. But two months to six months, I think, is a fair estimate of considering a [writ] [ph] on appeal. If the writ is granted then we go ahead and get into a briefing situation on the appeal. An appeal could take, again this is a wide range there because one doesn\u2019t completely know but nine months to two years on an appeal is not uncommon.","If we seek a writ and the writ is denied then the appeal stops at that point and we would then look to appeal any sort of judgment on any Butte case to again re-raise the issue if we lose. So that\u2019s really, I think, the best insight we can give you on how this could play out.","Stephen Byrd","That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess just adding on to that. Both for this decision as well as I guess the San Diego case which we expect ultimately to go to the California Court of Appeals as well. If you do have victory on one of these court cases or one of other utilities do, would that decision effectively apply to the Northern California claims and cases that are likely to be arising as per Steve Fleishman's question earlier in terms of all the case filed. In other words, are those decisions timely enough to be able to apply to these upcoming cases that you likely would have for the Northern California fires.","John Simon","We would most certainly argue they do. It depends a little bit on what the decision says and how it's written. I would say there is a good chance that a decision from the trial court but particularly in appeals court would be considered and applied by another court considering a wild fire case. It's not completely certain on that point, Steven, and I don\u2019t want to overly speculate, but that would then get worked out in the courts over the next couple of years.","Stephen Byrd","Okay. Great. And sorry for all the questions. Just one last one on, really on -- I am thinking about co-leasing of equipment with the telecom companies. And there sometimes is a telecom equipment involved as well. What is your general take on how if at all that could intersect with the overall investigation or whether or not that might imply some involvement or causation from the telecom equipment side of things? Or is that too uncertain at this point.","John Simon","Well, to re-stress what Jason and Geisha said, it's very early and the investigations are ongoing. I will tell you, what we do know is that after the 2017 wild fires. Cal Fire, which is the lead investigation agency sent letters to various companies with respect to asking us to make sure we preserve evidence which of course we are doing. They sent those letters also to some telecoms, I don\u2019t know which ones off of the top of my head. So I think we have to see how the investigations play out and see which facilities, if any, we are talking about here. But I think, it's potentially a bigger world than just PG&E involved in litigation. That\u2019s really, as far as I know.","Geisha Williams","If I could add something to that, Steven, this is Geisha. When you look at the fire footprint for these 21 fires, something like 75% of the poles that are in the impacted area are jointly used. In other words, they have both PG&E equipment and telecom equipment. Only 25% of the poles are just PG&E. So that also should give you a little bit of flavor in terms of the potential impact.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.","Michael Lapides","Couple of easy questions for you. First of all, can you remind us which of the telecom companies overlap with your service territory in the area impacted by the October 2017 wild fires. Is it just the wire line telephone, is it the cable, is it both?","Jason Wells","Michael, this is Jason. It's hard to say definitively over that fire footprint, but what I would say is cable and telecom both have quite a bit of equipment on our poles up there. And it would be the traditional large cable and telecom companies owning that equipment.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Can you all talk a little bit about whether, I am trying to think a little bit about when you would start actually paying out claims, meaning the cash that you settle as part of the October 2017 wild fire process. We wait obviously until you get the Cal Fire report and kind of some of the other reports, maybe your own as well. Would you start kind of resolving those complaints as early an as soon as possible to get through them. I am just trying to think about cash flow and liquidity.","Jason Wells","Michael, this is Jason. It's just really way too early in that process. We don\u2019t really know the cause of the fires. It's hard to kind of give, kind of any estimate on when claims will be resolved. I will just provide some anecdotal evidence as it relates to the Butte fire though. That fire, it took about seven months or so to publish the results of the investigation on the causes of fire. We didn\u2019t start settling claims for probably about another six months or so. So it was a good year sort of after the fire before we started to settle on [dues] [ph]. Obviously the Northern California wild fires are a much more complex set of fires but right now we just don\u2019t have any better visibility to time any cash flows.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And then last thing. Like we saw in the San Diego case and you all have seen in Butte. Even if the inverse condemnation is reversed, there is still exposure of potential private kind of negligence related lawsuits. How do you kind of think through that process and how that process would work relative to a process where inverse condemnation is kind of the governing statute or governing rule.","John Simon","It's John Simon, Michael. Very different theories and negligence which is reasonable in the standard of care is determined by the [try or] of fact at the end of the day after a trial. And so you know, you think about those cases very differently whereas inverse is strict liability and utilities conduct and even if we did everything right, really doesn\u2019t matter. In a negligence case it's all about, as I said, standard of care. So it's lengthier process that\u2019s determined in court down the road. We think as we have said in the Butte case, that we exercised all reasonable standards of care and we are prepared to defend ourselves in court on a negligence claim if we get to that.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Last one. How long did it take in the Butte case before you had a good handle on what the total number of claims that were submitted was like, I can just kind of go through the 10-Qs and go through the amounts that got you up to the $1.1 billion. But can you just remind us, you know how much time that took before all the claims actually got filed before you had a chance to evaluate.","John Simon","It\u2019s possible some more claims could in. So we had -- it was fairly stable on the number of claims filed. But at the two year anniversary of the Butte fire, which is the time at which the statute limitations expired for personal injury claims. We got a large spike of claims, which is where we sit today. The statute limitations runs on property damages at the three year anniversary of the fire. That\u2019s why I said it's possible more claims could come in. Our experience in Butte was most of them did come in within a year or so of the event. But again, we had that spike towards the two-year anniversary on the statute and could see more when the property damage statute expires. It's hard to come up with a rule of thumb on the cadence and timing of when claims are filed. That\u2019s sort of our best view of what happened.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. You may proceed.","Greg Gordon","A couple of questions. Just I want to be clear I understood what I heard with regard to your plans for equity. In the Q3 disclosures you said you needed about $400 million to $500 million a year of equity. And you disclosed just today, you are saying tax increases debt by $200 million a year this year and next year. On the other hand you are not -- have generated $1 billion of cash by virtue of not paying the dividend for as long as you are not doing that annualized. So are you saying that you are going to issue $600 million to $700 million a year or are you simply giving us for the next two years, for '18, or are you saying that would theoretically be your equity need in the normal course of business framework but the actual amount of equity you are going to issue is going to be different from that. I am just not clearly on exactly what your guidance was today.","Jason Wells","Sure. Thanks for the question, Greg. A couple of things there. On the Q3 call, our $400 million to $500 million forecast for equity related to 2017. On the Q3 call we provided qualitative guidance on 2018 and 2019 equity needs, which was we would essentially be able to largely meet our expected equity needs in 2018 and 2019 through our internal programs which on average generated $350 million. Rolling forward to today's discussion of equity, what we wanted to provide was sort of the underlying changes in the base equity needs. And so the principal change from the Q3 call for 2018 and 2019 guidance of roughly $350 million annually was that we now expect to need $200 million more in both 2018 and 2019 weighted to tax reform. We also have small incremental equity needs related to the items impacting comparability, which I disclosed.","Offsetting those equity needs, we will continue to issue equity under our internal programs although we expect the numbers to be less this year, given the suspension of the dividend. At the same time since we are not paying out a dividend, that more than offsets the equity we would have had to raise. Ultimately what we try to do here with this guidance is provide sort of the underlying equity drivers so that you can make your assumptions around any potential equity from -- potential liabilities from the Northern California wild fires as well as your view on the assumptions for the length of the dividend suspension. What we have tried to do is provide those components.","Greg Gordon","Yes, that\u2019s actually very clear. But I guess it begs the question, like do you expect to keep your internal programs, sort of at a minimum in terms of the equity you are going to issue this year which you were also very clear on saying would be 350 in the normal course of business but probably $60 million lower, all things equal, given that there is now no dividend that the drip would therefore not generate any proceeds.","Jason Wells","Yes. We do intend to keep the internal programs on. While they on average generated $350 million annually, there was some variability. The ranges for the last three years were between $300 million to $400 million. We know though that it could be as much as $60 million less as a result of the dividend suspension. So there will be some variability as to what those internal programs generate. But those are the components.","Greg Gordon","Okay. That\u2019s 100% clear. Thanks. My second question is, relative from a quarterly cash -- from a cash flow perspective, when you look at your PG&E subsidiary and you look at the corporate parent. Now that you have suspended the dividend, is cash actually flowing up to the parent to fundamentally cover the parent interest and overhead obligations or is PG&E essentially a closed system at this point. Not dividend in cash up to the parent and does the parent have any other cash sources other than the equity you are issuing to cover its costs. And approximately, what are those costs on a quarterly and annual basis.","Jason Wells","Well, the decision to suspend the dividend was both at the utility as well as PG&E Corporation. So, no, there is no more cash flowing from the utility to the corporation. That being said, as I mentioned, we are continuing to issue equity under the internal programs. And just to sort of frame the ongoing sort of cost of the corporation. We have about $350 million in holding company debt which is starting to mature in 2019. But we don\u2019t really have much in the way of incremental overhead. And beyond sort of the sources of cash from the internal programs, we also have accessed the commercial paper markets at the holding company. So we have sufficient liquidity at the holding company despite not having dividends from the utility to the holding company.","Greg Gordon","Okay. So unallocated corporate expenses like advertising or incentive compensation, things like that. What you look at what's not being paid for in rates that\u2019s unrecoverable, that\u2019s parent. It's not a meaningful number at any given quarter?","Jason Wells","No, the majority of those costs for things such as advertising, compensation which is not recovered in the rate cases, are really cross-borne by the utility as below the line costs. They are not charged back to customers but those are essentially cost that are incurred at the utility level. So we have minimal overhead costs at the holding company.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan. You may proceed.","Christopher Turnure","I wanted to understand, one, as it relates to the Buttes proceedings, you continued to settle claims even knowing that you are challenging the June 22 decision there. And then secondly, can you just remind me if you had appealed that June decision on any other grounds then just challenging the punitive damage element of it.","John Simon","Christopher, John. Let me take these both. The first one, we are well aware that the outcome of our inverse condemnation motion could impact both the timing and valuation of any settlements. We are monitoring that very carefully. We really are gearing for the motion right now. And what we had some court ordered mediations to try to reach settlements where we have been very diligent and careful about not getting ahead of that motion. With respect to your second question, the company took a writ to the court of appeals on the trial judge's denial of our motion to strike punitive damages from the Butte case. That\u2019s what's up on appeal right now and that appeal writ has been taken. So we are now in the process of briefing that issue before the court of appeals. There is nothing else before the court of appeals on Butte but as I mentioned earlier, depending on the outcome of the inverse decision, we would seek a writ to the court of appeals on that.","Christopher Turnure","So, sorry, that\u2019s for the punitive damage element only?","John Simon","Yes.","Christopher Turnure","So not an appeal of the entire decision?","John Simon","Correct.","Geisha Williams","You may want [indiscernible] what we are going to do on March 15.","John Simon","And just as a reminder, on March 15, different issues and punitive damages, March 15 is the issue of our motion to get inverse condemnation dismissed out of Butte. So there is many things happening on the legal front in Butte. Punitive damages, getting those eliminated. And the inverse condemnation and getting that dismissed.","Christopher Turnure","Right, right. What I was trying to distinguish was from that June decision other than the punitive damage element, how successful or unsuccessful were you on challenging that decision. Even though that goes back in time obviously.","John Simon","Yes. On the punitive decision?","Christopher Turnure","No, just on -- I guess, we could break it into two, just say obviously you didn\u2019t want inverse condemnation applied there on what were your options at that time for that.","John Simon","Yes. We didn\u2019t take a writ to the court of appeals on the Butte judges initial denial of our motion to get rid of inverse condemnation. But we would do that now. I think what's changed as we have talked about, is the CPUC's decision on San Diego's WEMA case where the CPUC basically indicated that they didn\u2019t believe inverse condemnation as a court was relevant to their decision on spreading costs. So that\u2019s sort of the intervening fact as to why we have renewed our motion in Butte and that\u2019s where we are on that.","Christopher Turnure","Okay. I hear you. It seems kind of surprising to me that outside of the CPUC rejection, you guys didn\u2019t feel like you have a good enough legal case to challenge that up to a higher court at that time.","John Simon","The basis for that denial, back in the summer, the original motion was the fact that there was no evidence historically of the CPUC denying cost recovery under inverse claims. Essentially the previous cases where inverse condemnation was applied to investor-owned utilities were settled at levels that were covered by insurance and therefore there were no cost recovery applications directly heard by the commission. Given that is the basis for the ruling this past summer and given the fact that the commission denied San Diego's WEMA application, we now have direct evidence that investor-owned utilities do not have the ability to adjust rates for the costs associated with inverse condemnation. So sort of facts changes pretty significantly over those six months.","Christopher Turnure","Got you. Okay. Hopefully, you will prevail there. My second question is a little bit broader and speaks to one of the earlier questions. You have cut your dividend here, clearly sending a strong message but the CPUC does not seem to appreciate the gravity of this situation at all, in my opinion. So is there something else that you could do to really the point home that this is going to hurt customers in the end. Like you guys cutting your CapEx or taking some other action to protect shareholders.","Jason Wells","Thank you for the question. I want to emphasize one part of that, the statement about the decision just around the dividend sending a strong message. By no way or no means was the underlying message a consideration for the suspension dividend. The decision to suspend the dividend was essentially governed by the California corporate code and our consideration of our ability to pay a lawful dividend under that code. That been said, as a result of that decision, it is strong evidence that the commission needs to evaluate the impact inverse condemnation is having on investor and utilities. We are aggressively pursuing multiple challenges and trying to bring awareness to policymakers and the state on this issue. We do believe given some of the comments that the commissioners and President Picker have made in other forums as well as a number of the messages that key policy makers and the state have made around the need to address comprehensive solutions for the impacts of climate change. We believe while the awareness of the issue is understood and we are working constructively to find a comprehensive solution.","Chris Foster","Chris, thank you. This is Chris. Keira, thanks for helping us with the call today. It's 9 o'clock. I want to also thank everyone for joining us and have a safe day. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for attending. This now concludes the conference.

[Operator Instructions] At this time I\u2019d like to introduce your hostess, Ms Janet Loduca. Thank you and enjoy your conference. You may proceed, Ms. Loduca.","Janet Loduca","Thank you, Jackie, and thanks to those of you on the phone for joining us. Before I turn it over to Tony Earley, I want to remind you that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements about our outlooks for future financial results which are based on assumptions, forecasts, expectations and information currently available to management. Some of the important factors that could affect the Company\u2019s actual financial results are described on the second page of today\u2019s slide deck. We also encourage you to review our quarterly report on form 10-Q that will be filed with the SEC later today and the discussion of risk factors that will \u2013 appears there and in the 2015 annual report.","With that I\u2019ll hand it over to Tony.","Tony Earley","Well, thank you, Janet, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us this morning on what I know is a busy day for all of you. I\u2019m going to start with some opening remarks and then turn it over to Jason to go through our financial results. We continue to believe that the key focus area shown on slide three provide the foundation for operational and financial success.","So I\u2019ll start with how we\u2019re thinking about the future in the context of California\u2019s clean energy policies. With the passage of AB350 last year California will be doubling its energy efficiency goals and increasing the renewable portfolio standard to 50% by 2030. Over time these mandates will impact both our electric procurement needs and our investment opportunities.","On the investment side California\u2019s policies will drive capital expenditures in both the electric distribution and transmission systems. We\u2019re going to have to continue to upgrade the distribution grid to sport increasing levels of distributor resources, and we\u2019ll need new and upgraded transmission lines to support the utility scale renewables required to meet the higher RPS standards.","On the procurement side we expect electric demand to decrease as customers continue to reduce the energy they need from PG&E through energy efficiency and distributed generation. We also expect that some cities will pursue community choice aggregation where they will purchase their own generation.","As we consider the changing energy landscape in California became clear to us that we needed to take a hard look at the future of Diablo Canyon. Working with a diverse coalition of labor and environmental groups we crafted a joint proposal to retire Diablo Canyon at the end of its current license terms which are 2024 for one unit and 2025 for another and to replace it with a greenhouse gas free portfolio of renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy storage.","We\u2019ve also voluntarily committed to a 55% RPS target beginning in 2031. I\u2019m very pleased to report that the State lands commission recently extended the lease for Diablo Canyon\u2019s intake and outflow structures so that it now runs through the current NRC license terms, and that was an important first step in carrying out our plan. In August we\u2019ll be filing an application for CPUC approval of the joint proposal by the end of 2017.","We believe the joint proposal fully supports California\u2019s long-term clean energy goals while providing time for a thoughtful transition to new greenhouse gas free resources. Turning to customer expectations, we\u2019ve made significant progress in all of our key rate cases during the quarter. As you know we received a final decision on the first phase of the 2015 gas transmission and storage rate case in June.","The decision acknowledged the need to continue investing in the safety of the system and authorized revenues for much of the work that we had requested. Given the significant delays in the case that also included revenues for an additional attrition year in 2018. In a separate phase of the case the commission will consider how to allocate the $850 million disallowance ordered last year as part of the San Bruno penalty decision. We hope to get a final phase 2 decision sometime this fall. And Jason\u2019s going to take you through our expectations around the financial impacts of that decision which is quite complex.","Moving on to our General Rate Case which covers most of our business. We\u2019ve been engaged in settlement discussions with other parties over the last few months. Last week we filed a notice of settlement conference which will take place on August 3. But given the confidentiality of settlement discussions we can\u2019t really comment further today, but we do consider this a positive development. We\u2019re also continuing to have settlement discussions in the TO 17 rate case.","The rates are in place subject to refund while the case is pending. And tomorrow will be filing our next electric transmission rate case TO 18. We\u2019ll be requesting an additional $100 million in capital expenditures which we\u2019ve incorporated into our multi-year projections. Let me shift to the operational side of things. As we get into the driest part of the year, we\u2019ve launched aggressive fire preparedness efforts focused on prevention, detection and response.","Although we have had more rain this year than last, California\u2019s experiencing significant tree mortality following several years of drought. To mitigate this increased fire risk we\u2019re supplementing our annual inspections by conducting daily aerial patrols and proactive foot patrols over fire prone parts of our service territory.","And finally we continue to work towards resolving outstanding issues. In June we received a presiding officer\u2019s decision in the gas distribution record keeping investigation. Overall we thought the decision was balanced recognizing the actions we\u2019ve taken to improve our records and the safety of the system and finding that many of the violations were isolated rather than systemic issues.","The safety and enforcement division and the city of Carmel have appealed the decision seeking a higher fine, and we now are waiting for a commission to issue a final decision. The federal trial in the \u2013 or the trial in the federal criminal case began in June. And the case was submitted to the jury yesterday. Because we\u2019re in the sensitive part of the trial we\u2019re just not in a position to comment on any of the specific evidence or testimony.","I can tell you that we continue to believe that no PG&E employee knowingly and willfully violated the law, but now it\u2019s in the hands of the jury. So to sum things up, we are working to resolve all of our pending rate cases, and we continue to make steady progress on outstanding regulatory and legal issues. And we are well-positioned to help drive California\u2019s clean energy future through sustained investments.","So with that let me hand it over to Jason to walk you through our financials. Jason?","Jason Wells","Thank you, Tony, and good morning everyone. Before I get into the second quarter results I want to provide a brief overview of the phase 1 gas transmission rate case decision. I\u2019ll start by saying that this is one of the most complicated rate case decisions we\u2019ve ever seen. Our financial results and projections reflect a number of key assumptions and new items from the decision. So I want to make sure that we\u2019re all grounded on those.","Turning to Slide 4, the first thing I\u2019ll cover is revenue recognition. Because the decision came so late in the rate case period, we have not collected any incremental revenues for 2015 or for the first seven months of 2016. Those incremental revenues make up our under collected amounts. There are two important points I\u2019d like to cover regarding incremental revenues.","First, while the phase 1 decision allows us to begin billing customers on August 1, we would not be able to recognize the full true up of the under collected revenues until after the phase 2 decision when we know the final revenue requirement. Second, the phase 1 decision requires us to amortize these under collected amounts over 36 months.","Utility accounting rules allow us to recognize revenues only if they will be collected within 24 months of the end of the year. As a result, assuming we get a final phase 2 decision by year-end, we will recognize 29 months out of the 36 month amortization period in 2016. The 29 months includes the actual revenues we will collect in the remaining five months of 2016 plus the amounts we will collect over the subsequent 24 months.","This means we\u2019ll recognize the remaining seven months of under collected amounts in the first quarter of 2017. These revenue recognition factors are important assumptions for the guidance I\u2019ll be covering today. The decision also impacts our capital expenditure forecasts. First it permanently disallows a portion of the 2011 though 2014 capital spend that we sought to true up in this rate case and subjects the remaining portion to audit with potential for future recovery.","The decision also includes a number of programs specific cost caps in one way balancing accounts. Since we are not in a position to adjust the spending we\u2019ve already completed, we anticipate that some capital programs will exceed the authorized amounts over the rate case that will not be recoverable in the future. As I\u2019ll discuss in a minute, we\u2019ve taken one-time charge for this during the quarter for those items.","And finally the phase 2 decision allocating the $850 million San Bruno penalty creates some additional uncertainty. Several parties have suggested that all of the $850 million should be allocated to expense. For purposes of today\u2019s presentation, we assume that we receive a final phase 2 decision this year and that the penalty will be allocated to roughly $690 million in capital and $160 million in expense consistent with the original San Bruno penalty decision. We\u2019ll obviously need to make adjustments if the phase 2 decision changes that allocation.","So with that overview let\u2019s go through the financials. Slide 5 shows ours results for the second quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $0.66. GAAP earnings including the items impacting comparability are also shown here. Pipeline related expenses came in at $27 million pretax for the quarter. Our legal and regulatory related expenses were $14 million pretax, and fines and penalties were $172 million pretax.","The fines and penalties items, reflects two components this quarter. The first component represents our estimate of the disallowed safety-related capital resulting from the San Bruno penalty decision which we are accruing as we complete the work. This item totaled $148 million pretax for the quarter. The second component is a fine of $24 million for the gas distribution record keeping investigation. For now we reflected the presiding officer\u2019s decision.","We\u2019ll make any necessary adjustments when the commission rules on the appeals. Butte fire related costs also reflect two components. First we booked $49 million pretax for additional cleanup, repair and legal costs associated with the Butte fire. We do not expect any additional cleanup and repair costs in the future. This item is offset by a positive insurance receivable of $260 million which reflects the low end of the range for estimated insurance recoveries.","The two components net to a positive $211 million pretax. One important note regarding the insurance receivable. While we have recorded the low end of the range at this time, we plan to seek full recovery of cost for insurance and believe that nearly all the third-party claims will ultimately be recovered through insurance. So the $260 million receivable should not be interpreted as a ceiling on insurance recovery.","The next line item GT&S capital disallowance is new this quarter. We booked a charge of $190 million pretax reflecting the two components of disallowed capital I discussed on slide 4 which are the $135 million for work performed in 2011 through 2014 plus $55 million for capital spending 2015 through 2018 that we expect will exceed authorized cost caps. The last line relates to the impact and the timing of the gas transmission rate case decision.","This is where we will reflect out of period GT&S revenues once we begin recognizing them. To ensure that our 2016 results are comparable year-over-year, we plan to reflect all of the revenues authorized for our 2016 cost of service and earnings from operations this year. And reflect the out of period revenues as an item impacting comparability.","Consistent with the revenue recognition factors on slide four, this item will continue into 2017 when we recognize the remaining seven months of the out of period revenues. Moving on, Slide 6 shows our quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations of $0.91 in Q2 last year and $0.66 in Q2 this year. The timing of taxes during the quarter with $0.08 negative.","As a reminder this line is purely a timing item that in total will reverse by year-end. A number of smaller miscellaneous items totalled $0.08 negative for the quarter. And nuclear refueling outage during the quarter resulted in $0.06 negative, regulatory and legal matters totalled $0.05 negative for the quarter and issuing additionally shares resulted in $0.03 negative. These negative drivers were partially offset by growth in rate-based earnings which was $0.05 positive for the quarter.","This item reflects assets covered by our General Rate Case and our electric transmission TO rate case. It does not include the gas transmission rate case since we did not recognize any revenue increase in Q2. Today we are reaffirming our guidance for earnings from operations of $3.65 to $3.85 per share, and that is shown on slide 7 along with GAAP guidance.","On Slide 8, you can see the underlying assumptions for that guidance which we\u2019ve updated to reflect the phase 1 gas transmission rate case decision. Starting at the top left, we assumed capital expenditures of roughly $5.6 billion for the year consistent with the last quarter.","The gas transmission CapEx is now $700 million consistent with the amounts authorized in the phase 1 decision. Last quarter we shared a range of $500 million to $700 million. We\u2019ve also reduced the electric distribution CapEx by $50 million to reflect our current spending for projections.","Moving to the top right we\u2019ve also adjusted our assumption for a weighted average authorized rate base to about $32.4 billion from our previous assumption of about $32.6 billion. Consistent with the phase 1 gas transmission rate case decision we\u2019ve adjusted the gas transmission rate base to $2.8 billion down from $3 billion to $3.4 billion range we showed last quarter.","This reduction is driven primarily a removal of the roughly $700 million in 2011 through 2014 capital spend that we had expected to true up in rate base this year. As a reminder rate base incorporates depreciation and deferred taxes. So it\u2019s not a one-for-one relationship with capital expenditures particularly since this capital was spent several years ago.","As a result, the rate base impact of this spend is closer to $500 million. On the bottom right, I want to reiterate that our 2016 guidance assumes that we received a final phase 2 decision in the gas transmission rate case this year and that it allocates the disallowance of safety-related spend consistent with the San Bruno penalty decision.","The other bullets are consistent with what we\u2019ve shown here before. The bottom line is that based on these assumptions we continue to target earning our authorized return on equity across the enterprise plus the net impact of the other earnings factors listed here.","Turning to Slide 9, the guidance for 2016 items impacting comparability has been updated to include the phase 1 gas transmission rate case decision and our assumptions for phase 2. I will walk through each of these items briefly. There\u2019s no change to the range for pipeline related costs which covers the work to reclaim our rights of way. Legal and regulatory related expenses also remain unchanged.","The fines and penalties item has been adjusted for two items. First the guidance includes the $24 million accrual for the presiding officer\u2019s decision in the gas distribution record keeping investigation. And second, the disallowed expense charge for the San Bruno penalty has been reduced from $116 million to $130 million due to the ## month amortization period. The remaining $30 million will shift to 2017.","This item excludes any additional potential future fines or penalties beyond our current assumptions for the distribution record-keeping penalty and the San Bruno penalty. When we have a final phase 2 decision in the gas transmission rate case we will also include the associated ex parte penalty in this item. The Butte fire related costs are shown next. At this time we remain unable to estimate the high end of the range for third-party damages associated with the fire.","As a reminder, last quarter we booked $350 million to reflect our estimate of the low end of the range for property damage. This quarter we recorded an insurance receivable of $260 million reflecting the low end of the range for estimated insurance recoveries. The remaining amounts reflect our recorded legal and operational costs associated with the Butte fire. Next we show the new item impact in comparability for the GT&S capital disallowance which is consistent with the assumptions shown on Slide 4.","The last item covers the impact of the timing of the GT&S decision. The $350 million shown here reflects the 29 months of out of period revenues we expect to recognize in 2016. As I mentioned this item will continue into 2017 when we recognize the remaining seven months.","Moving on to Slide 10. We currently expect to issue right around $800 million in equity and 2016 so we\u2019ve eliminated the range we\u2019ve showed in Q1. The incremental equity required by the new charges to this quarter is roughly offset by the Butte fire insurance receivable. In the first half of this year we issued about $300 million through our internal and Dribble programs.","Turning to Slide 11, we are updating the multi-year CapEx ranges. For gas and electric distribution and generation the high end of the range continues to reflect the requested amounts in the General Rate Case through 2019. For gas transmission the high end of the range through 2018 has been reduced to reflect the lower authorized CapEx in the phase 1 decision in the gas transmission rate case.","These expenditures are held flat in 20189. For electric transmission the high end of the range in 2017 now reflects the request in the TO 18 electric transmission rate case which we will file tomorrow. These expenditures are held flat in 2018 and 2019. Taken together these changes reduce the high end of the range to $6.4 billion compared to $6.5 billion shown last quarter.","The low end of the range remains consistent with our 2015 capital spending. Overall you can see that we continue to expect robust capital spending going forward. On Slide 12 we\u2019ve updated the rate based ranges consistent with the capital spending on the previous slide. The high end of the range also assumes that the portion of the 2011 through 2014 capital spend that is subject to audit is added to rate base in 2017. These adjustments narrow the range of rate based to a compound annual growth rate of 5.5% to 6.5% between 2017 and 2019.","Finally we\u2019ve added a new Slide 13 showing our dividend payout ratio targets. Consistent with our announcement during the quarter we increased the dividend this year by about 8% to $0.96 per share. We are targeting a 55% to 65% payout ratio with a specific objective of reaching 60% by 2019.","I know we\u2019ve covered a lot this morning. Let me close by saying that we continue to reach important regulatory, financial and operational milestones, and we are confident in our ability to deliver on our plans as we position the Company for future success.","So with that let\u2019s open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Steve Fleishman","Yes, hi everyone. Good morning.","Tony Earley","Good morning, Steve.","Jason Wells","Good morning.","Steve Fleishman","Can you hear me? So I think I got all the moving pieces here and appreciate you going through it. Just to clarify so on the GT&S rate base that\u2019s subject to the audit, that is excluded from the 2016 rate base but then it comes back in and 2017?","Jason Wells","That is correct.","Steve Fleishman","Okay.","Jason Wells","At the high end for the 2017 rate base.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. At the high end. Okay. Is there \u2013 while in 2016 while it\u2019s kind of in this limbo, do you have any earnings on it like non-rate base earnings or only when it goes in to rate base? Does it get like AFDC or something or some kind of treatment?","Jason Wells","No. It\u2019s not earnings rate base in 2016.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. So for example it\u2019s not in your 2016 guidance essentially range or earning money on that?","Jason Wells","That\u2019s right. We pulled it out and that was really the key adjustment to the gas transmission and storage rate base reflected in our assumptions.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then just the high end of the rate base ranges through 2019, the reason those came down is what then? A little bit?","Jason Wells","We\u2019re tightening the ranges because we because of the gas transmission phase 1 decision. Historically they\u2019ve reflected the high end of the range that we \u2013 based on the amounts requested in the case. And now that we have a decision on that CapEx and rate base, we\u2019re adjusting the ranges to be consistent with that decision. That reduction \u2013 I was just going to mention that reduction is offset by a small increase from electric transmission.","Steve Fleishman","Got it. And you kind of narrowed brought the high end down brought the low end up? Kind of narrowed the rate.","Jason Wells","Yes you know I think as we resolve some of these regulatory proceedings we\u2019re getting more certain on what the range is and that\u2019s what this narrowing reflects.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then just on equity, you had the same amount of shares maybe this is just a rounding thing, but you had the same amount of shares outstanding at the end of Q1 and Q2 but you\u2019re saying you issued $300 million in equity, and I recall that are being lower for Q1?","Jason Wells","I don\u2019t have the Q1 number in front of me, but we did issue through the second quarter of the year $300 million in additional equity for 2016.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Okay. I think that\u2019s all I had. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Fleishman. Our next question Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Anthony Crowdell","Good morning. There was a story in one of the industry papers that spoke about the trial and said the judge in the federal trial had maybe lowered the bar on proving a willingness I guess for a guilty verdict, and I know you can\u2019t speak about the trial, but I\u2019m wondering is there a lower bar in the decision of an alternative fines act, or is there a higher standard there than in the criminal trial?","Tony Earley","Let me ask Hyun Park our General Counsel to comment on it.","Hyun Park","Yes, so I don\u2019t think that relate to the alternative fines act portion. I have not seen the specific article that you\u2019re talking about. But I think what you may be referring to is a jury instruction that the judge gave with respect to willfulness in the context of a corporation as a defendant, and he said that you do have to find that a specific employee acted willfully even in the Corporation context. So that may be what you are referring to.","Anthony Crowdell","Yes. That\u2019s correct. And then lastly on related to the alternative fines act has there been any discussion on what the gross gain was realized by the Company?","Hyun Park","So it\u2019s the number that appears in the indictment which is $281 million. That\u2019s what the government has alleged and under the alternative finds act if they can prove beyond a reasonable doubt, that the criminal violations led to the $281 million gain then under the act you can actually double that as the maximum fine.","Anthony Crowdell","Great [indiscernible]","Tony Earley","But there will be no discussion of that unless we get to a phase 2 in the trial.","Anthony Crowdell","Okay, great. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Crowdell. Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hi, good morning.","Tony Earley","Good morning.","Jason Wells","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So just to think a little bit more strategically here, obviously developments with Diablo Canyon how are you thinking about the eligibility for utility owned assets to replace the $2 billion or so in rate base today for Diablo Canyon? And then separately I\u2019d be curious, what is the impact to consumers from a bill inflation perspective for the Diablo Canyon early retirement? Or I suppose retirement without extensions?","Geisha Williams","Julien, hi, this is Geisha Williams. So regarding the Diablo Canyon issue and utility ownership of replacement power our intention is to issue a number of trenches the first thing being energy efficiency the second one being non-GHG resources, and in both cases those will the open for a competitive solicitation and of course the utility could conceivably be a bidder in that regard.","So it\u2019s possible. But that\u2019s to be determined in the future. As far as replacement of the rate base that\u2019s beyond the \u2013 I guess the guidance period for us or for the period for which we are looking at our rate based but I mean obviously if you look at the structure the regulatory structure here in California than really conducive because you need to add the modernize the infrastructure. We\u2019ve had a very healthy capital program for many years and I don\u2019t see that changing but again, what that may look like beyond 2024, 2025 is to be determined.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it, okay. And then just turning back to the other side of the numbers if you will. Elaborating a little bit on Steve\u2019s question can you comment real quickly in your numbers what\u2019s reflected for if you were to get a decision in the near-term on the CapEx versus expense how you would recognize that, would you immediately reflect if it was to be an expense in your numbers and that would be an uplift for the back half as soon as you got that outcome?","Jason Wells","I think this GT&S rate case is a pretty complex one so, our guidance assumes that the phase 2 decision allocates the San Bruno penalty disallowance consistent with the original allocation so about 80% as a capital disallowance and about 20% as expense. As you know, we\u2019ve been accruing the capital portion of the disallowance since we first originally received that decision, and so really what remains outstanding is the disallowance for expense. And what we\u2019ve talked about in the past is that disallowance for that expense is really a disallowance of incremental revenues.","So I would say the one key change for the quarter is that given the 36 month amortization period which prevents us from recognizing all of the true up revenues essentially we only recognize about $130 million of that San Bruno expense disallowance here in 2016. The remaining $30 million which we had thought would be recognized in 2016 is now expected to be recognized in 2017 assuming that the allocation between capital and expense does not change in the phase 2 decision.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Just to be clear, as soon as the \u2013 when you get the decision that\u2019s when the expense hits or the true up and then going forward the rate base would be adjusted correspondingly as post the next update provides?","Jason Wells","That\u2019s correct. As soon as we get the final decision that\u2019s when we would take that $130 million disallowance for expense, but it is the final decision that we need before we record that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Smith. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.","Greg Gordon","Thanks, good morning.","Tony Earley","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon","So, when we think about earnings from operations and we go from 2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2018, 2018 to 2019 we should be thinking about the rate base slide you show us on page 12 and what we think the earnings power is of the business there net of other factors and what the other factors would be on page 8. So I guess the big question is what we\u2019re looking at 2018 in 2019 earnings, how many \u2013 are we going to be through this period where there are these multiple bridge line items from operating basis earnings to GAAP basis earnings?","Once we\u2019re in 2018 in 2019 do you expect that all of the repercussions accounting differences from all this complex rate making and disallowances will be behind us and that they\u2019ll be a very tight band between your operating basis earnings in your GAAP basis earnings? If not what will be continuing on?","Jason Wells","Thank you for the question. Assuming no new items, we do expect that we will resolve these lingering issues by 2017. So that in 2018 through 2019, our EPS growth will more closely align to the rate base growth that is presented on Slide 12. I will say though that we have a strong CapEx program, and if we spend at the higher end of that range we will be required to issue some additional equity to fund that. And so there will be a small amount of dilution from those \u2013 from that additional equity, but our earnings profile should more closely match our rate based starting in 2018.","Tony Earley","Greg, this is Tony. I look at the left side I should point out that the Butte fire related costs that are listed there on Slide 9, historically those sorts of issues not only with us but with other California go on for multiple years. But certainly the gap will, will narrow because a lot of the other regulatory stuff should drop off.","Greg Gordon","Great. That\u2019s \u2013 investors just want to understand the real earnings power of the company is so that they can think out where your dividends going given what you\u2019ve articulated as the policy so that they can put the right value on the shares which looks like it\u2019s a lot higher than where it is trading now, but I think we\u2019ve got to get through some of these complex issues first. So thanks guys. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Gordon. Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Jonathan Arnold","Hi, good morning.","Tony Earley","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold","Picking up on equity and a couple of the other themes, does the way in which you\u2019re going to recognize the GT&S with some of it rolling over into 2017, does have the effect of having pulled forward some equity pushing you into that higher end in 2016, but maybe tempering whatever you may or may not have to do in 2017?","Jason Wells","The delay in terms of getting a final decision here that allows us to recognize this revenue has a small impact. This is really a timing related item that we\u2019re going to look to address appropriately with our financing, but it does have a small impact on our equity needs here in 2016.","Jonathan Arnold","And on 2017 how should we be thinking about whether you will or won\u2019t be an issuer in 2017? How much variability is there depending on some have these other pieces shake out?","Jason Wells","Well, I think it\u2019s \u2013 there are going to be a couple of items that in our items impacting comparability that transition into 2017. I still think the dominant item in our gas business that we\u2019re focused on is finishing our pipeline rights-of-way program where we\u2019re reclaiming our rights away. As we said that\u2019s a five year program not to exceed $500 million that we will completed 2017.","The rest of the \u2013 there will be some small adjustments related to the GT&S revenue timing impact that I mentioned. Those will largely net out, and so I think it starts to look like a more normal equity pattern in 2018 but certainly substantially reduced from 2016.","Jonathan Arnold","So I mean I guess reduced, more normal, what is the new normal? How much of 2016 do you consider to be kind of outside of the normal?","Jason Wells","We\u2019re not giving equity guidance for 2017 and 2018 but really the two main drivers continue to be our CapEx and our unrecovered costs. Those unrecovered costs will reduce significantly in 2017. And with the exception of Butte fire which as I\u2019ve mentioned we plan to seek recovery through insurance. We\u2019ll get back to a level of acquisitions that are really driven largely by our CapEx program.","Jonathan Arnold","Thank you and just if may on the quarter, you have this $0.08 of miscellaneous inside it\u2019s quite a big number any insight as to how some of that is likely to continue through the rest of the year guidance assuming some of it is not going to happen again but what\u2019s in behind that?","Jason Wells","Sure. Sure. As usual what I would say miscellaneous includes a number of small items. Some of them are timing related, some are not. But I think what\u2019s really important to emphasize though is we\u2019re reaffirming our annual guidance from earnings from operations this year. So I think that is really our focus.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Arnold. Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Michael Lapides","Hey, guys. Jason, want to focus a little bit on cash. You\u2019re talking about the revenue recognition for the delayed GT&S rate case. But can you talk about when you get the cash them in your have a whole year of a revenue increase in 2015 and seven months of that revenue increase in 2016, where not only do you not recognized it from an earnings perspective you\u2019ve not gotten \u2013 you haven\u2019t gotten the cash.","Can you talk about when you\u2019ll get the cash for that, for that period. Do you collect it over a 12 month, 24 month, 36 month and can you put some numbers around that just to quantify how much cash that is that you\u2019ve not collected to date but you anticipate collecting once everything gets finalized?","Jason Wells","Sure. So we have not collected roughly 19 months worth of incremental revenues. So that\u2019s all of 2015, and then our 2016 revenues through July. The phase 1 decision allows us to start billing customers in August 1 at that new revenue requirement so we\u2019ll start collecting those incremental revenues here in August, and there will be a 36 month amortization period starting in August, and so that will be the period of time in which we recover those incremental revenues. So it really is just a timing item between when we recognize, when we\u2019re able to recognize these revenues and when we collect them the amortization period.","Michael Lapides","And how much is that from a cash perspective the amount that is being amortized over 36 months?","Jason Wells","Roughly in a phase 1 decision, the annual revenue requirement increase was about $500 million, on a full year basis. So about $750 million in total. I will say though that that\u2019s the preliminary authorized revenue requirement, because it can be modified in the phase 2 decision as the commission looks at how to allocate the San Bruno penalty.","Michael Lapides","So you\u2019ve got \u2013 ex that phase 2 decision you got $750 million, or roughly $250 million year from the cash flow perspective, to help make up for \u2013 to help recapture some of that revenue just due to the delay in the case.","Jason Wells","That\u2019s correct. Yes.","Michael Lapides","Okay. That on the core California GRC and obviously lots of dockets in California not just yours but other utilities as well have faced delays as well. When that rate case gets implemented how should we think about the cash flow that you would get just due to the timing delay?","Jason Wells","Yes. I guess one of the issues will depend upon what happens with the settlement discussions, and I will ask Steve Malnight to comment on that.","Steve Malnight","Yes, Michael, so I think in terms of the outcome for the case first it would say like Tony mentioned we\u2019ve announced the settlement conference. We\u2019re hopeful that we can resolve that. The current schedule would call for decision in January. As you mentioned, there has been delays in many of the rate cases but at the same time the commission\u2019s already authorized retroactive revenue to be collected if the decision comes late, so we will collect it from January in a similar way to what Jason described. I think that in this case we just had a pretty extreme example in the GT&S case which really was an unusual case. It was extremely complex, and I think we saw much longer delay from the commission. So will see how the GRC plays out.","Michael Lapides","Got it and if let\u2019s say new rates came into effect in January how much of a delay is that?","Steve Malnight","That\u2019s a mean the case is for revenues in 2017 so if we got a final decision in January, as soon as we get implemented in rate would just be a few months of delayed revenue.","Michael Lapides","Got it, okay. Last item just trying to think in this is obviously maybe a little bit more for Tony. How are you thinking about potential investment opportunities outside of the core Pacific Gas & Electric utility and when I say that I mean things like Midstream, things if possible like on the renewable side. We\u2019re just trying to think about once things get a bit more notable at PG&E how to think about what the investment opportunity is for the broader Corporation.","Tony Earley","Michael, you\u2019re exactly right. This is the time really to start to think about that so as we start to get a number of these proceedings behind us. And we have actually started work on that let me ask Geisha to comment on that on what were doing in transmission, electric transmission and then I\u2019ll come back and comment a little further.","Geisha Williams","Hi, Michael, this is Geisha. On the electric transmission side, last quarter we announced an alliance with TransCanyon which will give us an opportunity to really compete for transmission projects not just within our own service area but within the broader CAL-ISO system. We think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity associated with transmission projects as we go to a 50% and in our case a 55% RPS level by 2030.","So we see a lot of opportunity both within our service area and now that we\u2019ve got the destrobe partnership with TransCanyon actually an alliance with TransCanyon, we see some opportunity for growth there. Of course this will be on the regulated side. If we start looking at the unregulated side I\u2019m going to turn back to either Tony or Jason.","Tony Earley","As you know California has some fairly stringent requirements around their affiliate rules. And so really want to make sure that their opportunities before you jump in because you have to keep it totally separate from the utility. And we\u2019re looking at that, but as Geisha said there are opportunities within the utility to partner particularly on new technologies. The reality is, that the work we\u2019ve done starting with smart meters and then moving to our automation in the grid, really gives us an opportunity to partner with a lot of these new technology providers. And we think there\u2019s opportunity both in the utility and possibly outside the utility. We\u2019re starting to look at that.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you, Tony, much appreciated.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Lapides. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Turnure with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Chris Turnure","Good morning. Jason, I was wondering if you could just reiterate your comments or give us a little bit more clarity on what changed for the equity issuance this quarter versus last quarter. You mentioned I think that I guess you had not been accounting for the Butte fire insurance proceeds and that was a positive and some of the phase 1 items negatively offset that?","Jason Wells","That\u2019s right. Yes, good morning, Chris. Thank you for the question. On the first quarter call I\u2019d indicated that we were trending towards the higher end of the range particularly because of the delay in the gas transmission rate case, but what I would say is what really changed between the first quarter and the second quarter is we recognized the Butte fire insurance receivable which reduced the equity needs, but that was offset by the GT&S capital disallowance that I talked about as well as the gas distribution record keeping fine. And so what we really saw a sort of narrowing of our expected equity issuances as to about $800 million and that\u2019s why we remove the range and just reiterated the $800 million target.","Chris Turnure","Okay. And then just to kind of follow up on an earlier question regarding the $850 million of San Bruno disallowance. Am I correct in kind of thinking about this in 2015 and probably all of 2016 as well that you had spent the cash for and written off around $500 million in capital last year and then again kind of done the same thing this year for about $300 million, but you\u2019ve yet to write off that O&M expense amount or spend the cash for that amount this year, so it\u2019s if things were to change with how phase 2 is being recognized, most of that would already be reflected in your numbers and your cash flow?","Jason Wells","Yes. From a cash standpoint we\u2019ve spent most of the money on the underlying work. It was about $400 million last year in the capital disallowance, the balance expected this year. And then as I mention you know we\u2019ve already spent the work on the expense programs while at the disallowance the expense we are waiting until we have the actual revenues and so there will be an offset of the incremental revenues that we ultimately recognize.","Chris Turnure","Okay that\u2019s very helpful thank you. And the only other thing I wanted to ask was a little bit more strategic. Maybe Tony you could comment on your thinking behind giving us payout guidance kind of out to 2019 and a specific number there. Why did you decide to do it now? Was it the GT&S or is it us getting closer to the remedies here with some of the criminal trial elements and the fines?","Tony Earley","Yes. I think the driving force is we were getting to the point where we had better visibility on the outcome of the various San Bruno proceedings. We also see this strong investment profile going forward to be consistent with California\u2019s clean energy objectives. And so we felt good about that. We also believe that just giving a one-time increase without saying more was not helpful to you as investors, so we thought A, we wanted to give a range and historically have talked about what I\u2019ve done in the past is have a payout range. And we wanted to give you some idea of the trajectory over the next couple of years. This wasn\u2019t a one and done. We want to have increases to get to that 60% payout ratio in 2019","Chris Turnure","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Turnure. Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please proceed.","Praful Mehta","Thank you, hi, guys.","Tony Earley","Good morning.","Jason Wells","Good morning.","Praful Mehta","Good morning. Just sticking on the theme of looking past the recent events and more and more to longer-term growth, as you look into 2018, 2019, and you\u2019ve kind of gone through these different changes, how do you see any challenges or constraints on that growth going forward? As in our rates going to be going to put pressure on that growth, or is there any other challenge, or do you see enough investment opportunity without too many constraints are challenges? How do you see that in terms of long-term growth?","Tony Earley","I\u2019d never say there are no going never going to be no challenges. I think you put your finger on one of the issues. We see plenty of investment opportunity to deal with the clean energy future here in California. We are very focused on what does it do for rates. We\u2019re very pleased that the current GRC that we\u2019re in negotiations around even with our ask and you never get everything you ask for, we were within the target that we set for ourselves as to keep rate increases around the rate of inflation.","And that\u2019s going to be our long-term goal. It\u2019s lumpy so you don\u2019t hit it exactly. But we will be focusing on that, and one of the challenges the whole trend of the lower projections for sales, due to energy efficiency, due to rooftop solar, due to the CCAs. So we\u2019re focusing on that trying to become more efficient, but I think it\u2019s all manageable, and we can drive that growth.","Praful Mehta","Got you. Just more specifically on the Butte fire insurance proceeds, you provide the range and you\u2019re saying you can\u2019t be at the low-end of the range just wanted to understand what are the push and pulls? What drives the range in the first place and what are the scenarios under which you end up at the low end of that range.","Jason Wells","So I\u2019ll first start with the Butte fire costs themselves, because I think that\u2019s where we sort of anchor off of. And as you will recall we took a charge for $350 million in Q1 related to property damage and that represents the low-end of the range. It really represents our estimate of the cost for the structures that were destroyed in the fire. As I mentioned we are trying to gather more information on the higher end of that range which would include the costs for damages for things such as trees, the loss in value of the trees in a fire and we still are working through that. That is really sort of the larger sort of determination of the range for the costs.","On the receivable side of things, as I mention we intend to seek the entirety of our costs related to the third-party claims for the Butte fire through insurance. We fully expect that we will seek full recovery of the third-party claims. From a County standpoint, though, we recognize will be considered to be sort of the low-end of that range for that receivable this quarter. And so I do want to emphasize is it really is just the low-end of the range where we are starting the negotiations with insurance carriers, but we fully expect to recover third-party costs through insurance.","Praful Mehta","Got you. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Mehta. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, there.","Tony Earley","Good morning.","Michael Weinstein","To follow-up in the $850 million San Bruno penalty. If that was allocated 100% to expense, what would be the consequences especially considering the treatment of previously accrued capital write offs?","Jason Wells","I think really the primary difference would be about an increase in rate base of $50 million. As I mentioned in the script, there is a difference between rate base and capital expenditures rate base includes depreciation and deferred taxes. So the primary difference would be about an increase about a $500 million increase in rate base. I would say the additional earnings from that rate base would offset the lower cash receipts that we would get by applying all of the disallowance to expense, so there would probably be minimal net impact on ongoing needs and so the real primary difference would be a change in rate base.","Michael Weinstein","Also, just to clarify, when in 2016 do you recognize the 24 months of under collection? Is that all at once when the phase 2 final decision comes out?","Jason Wells","That\u2019s correct. As soon as we receive a final phase 2 decision we\u2019ll recognize the full ## months of under collected revenues.","Michael Weinstein","And also another question I had was the insurance recoveries I know you said that your going to be pursuing full recovery. At what point does what\u2019s the timing of that those negotiate just like. When do you think you\u2019ll know when that receipt can be increased?","Jason Wells","I think this is going to be a lengthy process. Because it is going to be anchored more on the cost. So we\u2019ve only work through really just a handful of claims at this point. It\u2019ll probably take a couple of years to work through the remainder of those claims. As we have better certainty on the claims, we will adjust the costs associated with this. At the same point we\u2019ll be seeking insurance recoveries from our insurers, and so that \u2013 the cash receipt from that will come periodically over the next several years.","Michael Weinstein","I see the costs are also uncertain so this would not \u2013 I mean increasing that receivable potentially later does not affect the equity issuance at all?","Jason Wells","No. Not going forward. It would have a very small impact on needs.","Michael Weinstein","Got you. And just one final question. Do you have any update on status of efforts to reform the commission in California, just curious?","Steve Malnight","This is Steve Malnight. I think the governor and the legislature are in active discussions. They\u2019ve put out a proposal that really focuses on increasing transparency and improving some of the governance issues within the commission. We\u2019re observing that and watching that and continue to see how that evolves, but I think it is an active discussion in fact in Sacramento, and it is ongoing.","Michael Weinstein","Thanks a lot.","Janet Loduca","Operator, I think we have time for one final question.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Weinstein. Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie Group. Please proceed.","Angie Storozynski","Thank you. I wanted to go through again the 2018 and 2019 rate base projection. I know you are mentioned it earlier in the call, but could you remind me, so which portions of the asset base actually are kept basically stable from the most recent requests especially on the electric transmission side, et cetera? I\u2019m kind of to figure out if there was an upside where would it occur?","Jason Wells","Okay. I think it\u2019s probably easier to start first with CapEx and those changes. Because the CapEx profile is what really drives rate base, and so the high end of the range for CapEx essentially we have adjusted down slightly the high end of the range in 2016, 2017, and 2018 for the gas transmission and storage rate case, the phase 1 decision we just received. It now reflects what that decision provides.","Offsetting that though we increased the range by the transmission our electric transmission rate case that we expect to file tomorrow. That was a small increase in 2017 that we held flat then in 2018 and 2019. The high-end of the range and really then what provides probably the greatest sort of variability to that range relates to the General Rate Case which covers the period 2017 through 2019 that we\u2019re in the process of negotiating.","Given those assumptions on CapEx I would say the only other adjustment then in related to rate base was this $700 million in disallowance of the 2011 through 2014 capital spend. We \u2013 in the high end of the range starting in 2014, we assume that we would start earning on the remaining $400 million in 2017.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. That\u2019s fine. Thank you. The other question I\u2019m a little bit confused here. So you mentioned that the \u2013 you would recognize the penalty for San Bruno the final decision is rendered, that would be excluded from earnings from ongoing operations right? That would be in items impacting comparability?","Jason Wells","That\u2019s correct. Yes. It would not be reflective of our ongoing, so we\u2019ve included an estimate for that in our items impacting comparability.","Angie Storozynski","Now I don\u2019t whine you provide any audience for beyond 2016, but would be fair to assume it\u2019s basically just a financial CapEx and dividend requirement?","Jason Wells","Yes \u2013 so the largest drivers are equity really continue to be in our CapEx program and the unrecovered costs. The unrecovered cost really start to resolve themselves in 2017 so I would say 2018 and 2019 really are more reflective of ongoing needs to fund CapEx in our dividend plan assuming no new unrecovered costs.","Janet Loduca","All right. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us today. And we wish you a safe and happy day. Thanks."],"17369":["PG&E Corp.

Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the PG&E Corporation 2017 Second Quarter Conference Call.","At this time, I would like to pass the call to Ann Kim. Thank you and enjoy the conference. You may proceed, Ms. Kim.","Ann Kim - PG&E Corp.","Thank you, Mallory, and thanks to those of you on the phone for joining us.","Before I turn it over to Geisha Williams, I want to remind you that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results which is based on assumptions, forecasts, expectations and information currently available to management. Some of the important factors that could affect the company's actual financial results are described on the second page of today's slide deck. The deck also includes a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q that will be filed with the SEC later today and the discussion of risk factors that appears there and in our 2016 annual report.","With that, I'll hand it over to Geisha.","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Thanks, Ann. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we had a very strong quarter, one that was marked by continued impressive operational performance, encouraging progress on the regulatory front and solid financial results.","I'll start this morning with an update on some important actions we've taken this past quarter to continue strengthening our safety culture and operations. I'll then highlight some key investments we're making to enable us to meet our customers' evolving expectations while also keeping bills affordable. And finally, I'll cover some of the recent steps we've taken to help advance California's clean energy economy and position PG&E for continued success. After that, I'll turn things over to our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, David Thomason, to walk us through the financials as Jason Wells unfortunately has laryngitis, although he will be available for some questions.","Before we dive in, I'd like to review the final decision we recently received in the cost of capital case. The decision sets our allowed return on equity at 10.25% through the end of 2019, which is critical, given the nearly $6 billion in annual investments we will be making in our gas and electric system over that same period.","Just as importantly, our customers will benefit through lower rates, a savings of roughly $100 million annually. While I recognize it was a challenging process, in the end the cost of capital decision is yet another example of how coalitions can achieve effective solutions. I'm gratified to add this to the list, alongside the Diablo agreement we announced last summer and the 2017 GRC all-party settlement.","Let's move now to a review of our safety and operational progress for the quarter. As you may recall, in 2014 we were one of the first utilities in the world to be certified under both the ISO 55001 and PAS 55 safety standards. Every three years we have to go through a rigorous recertification process. The critical requirement for recertification is to demonstrate continuous improvement.","Well I'm happy to report that Lloyd's Register, the internationally recognized third-party auditor, recently recertified us in both ISO 55001 and PAS 55. This is independent third-party confirmation of our continually improving safety culture and industry-leading asset management program. And it's something I'm extremely proud of. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate and thank our teams on a truly great accomplishment, one that reflects our laser-like focus on safety, not just in the gas operations but across the company.","Staying on the theme of continuous improvement, I'd like to talk about the report that was issued in May in the CPUC's Safety Culture OII. We genuinely welcome and appreciate the thorough assessment and recommendations contained in the report. It's encouraging that the CPUC's consultant recognizes the numerous improvements we've made as a company to our safety culture. In fact, the first conclusion of the report affirms that, quote, \"PG&E employees at all levels are committed to safety,\" end quote. That speaks volumes about the culture we're building and I couldn't agree more. Safety is at the heart of everything we do here at PG&E.","Looking at the 68 specific recommendations in the report, most are fully consistent with our own safety plans. While there are a few recommendations in the report that we believe warrant further consideration by the CPUC in the upcoming proceeding, we agree with the vast majority of the recommendations and plan to implement them by the middle of next year.","Moving on to our operational performance, we had a number of highlights this past quarter and I'd like to focus on one in particular. This past June, most of California was hit by a historic heat wave. Millions of customers experienced temperatures in the triple digits for nearly a week. Demand on our system hit levels that we haven't seen in over a decade, reaching over 20,000 megawatts on June 22, just shy of our all-time system peak in 2006.","The good news is that less than 2% of our electric customers experienced a sustained loss of power during the peak outage day. Our strong reliability performance was even more noteworthy, given that one of our Diablo Canyon units was in a planned refueling outage during the same period. And in addition, at certain times during the heat wave, more than half of PG&E's energy supply was met with RPS-eligible resources.","This experience is a testament to the long-term investments we've made to modernize our system and it demonstrates what we've been saying for quite some time and that is, we can deliver the clean energy that our customers want and still provide great safety and reliability.","With our strong operational performance in mind, I would like to touch upon a couple of recent regulatory developments that help set the foundation for our future investments and will enable us to continue to deliver on our customer's evolving needs and expectations. The first is the final decision in our 2017 General Rate Case, which approved the all-party settlement between PG&E and our intervenors, including consumer advocates TURN and ORA.","While this gives us a clear line of sight into our distribution and generation revenues for the next three years, it also enables our plans for making the infrastructure investments necessary to meet our customers' energy needs. For example, the GRC authorizes CapEx increases related to electric reliability improvement, network cable replacement and capacity increases to support distributed generation resources. These are the same types of investments that enabled us to provide the safe and reliable service during the recent heat wave.","We're pleased with the outcome of the GRC decision which approves 98% of our rate base request and provides us with the resources needed to support continued investment in the grid. At the same time, we went into this rate case very mindful of the need to keep our customer bills affordable and the outcome represents a fairly modest 1% increase in our authorized revenues for 2017.","The second regulatory development I'd like to mention this morning is our electric transmission case, TO19, the application which we filed yesterday at FERC. We're seeking a $74 million increase in revenues starting in 2018 for such key capital investments as system reliability work and substation modernization. It is through these types of investments and these continued investments in our grid that we can help ensure our system is stable and that we can continue providing the high-quality service that our customers have come to expect.","The last area I'll cover this morning is the work we're doing to position PG&E for success in the future energy markets. In addition to the investments we're making to upgrade and modernize our grid, we are also leveraging our proximity to Silicon Valley to pilot new technologies and systems, in effect, beta testing, the grid of the future.","The rapid growth of both large-scale renewables and distributed energy resources, or DERs, means that we as a grid planner and operator, we have to find ways of managing third-party assets that we don't own or don't control, assets such as private rooftop solar or electric vehicles. We have to work on this as a system rather than look at these individual items in isolation.","In one of our many pilot projects we're working with General Electric, Tesla Energy and Green Charge Networks to test a distributed energy resources management system on three interconnected feeders this summer.","The pilot includes private, residential rooftop solar with smart inverters, residential battery storage, commercial\/industrial battery storage and a utility scale battery storage facility that PG&E owns and one which has the capability to sell into the wholesale market. What's unique about this pilot is that it gets right to the core of our grid modernization work, namely having visibility into all the resources that our customers are connecting to the grid and understanding how they respond when we, as a grid operator needs to manage them for the overall safety and reliability of the electric system.","Now in order to succeed in the future energy market, we not only need to invest in the right technologies and systems, we also need to have the right policies in place to help us achieve the state's clean energy goals. You may recall that during our Q1 earnings call, I mentioned the portfolio allocation mechanism, or PAM, filing that PG&E and the other California investor-owned utilities jointly submitted to the CPUC.","In the filing, we proposed to replace the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment with an updated approach that more fairly allocates costs and benefits between customers who choose CCAs or direct access, and those who stay with their existing energy provider. This is a critical issue where all parties recognize the need for reform.","On June 29, the CPUC voted out a new Order Instituting Rulemaking to review, revise and consider alternatives to the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment. While the CPUC at the same time dismissed the PAM application, we view the new OIR as a clear recognition of the need for reform to ensure that costs are fairly allocated to all customers in compliance with the state law. The CPUC has recognized the issues with the current mechanism and we will have the opportunity to advocate with the other IOUs for the types of reform that were included in the PAM application.","In closing, I want to reiterate that this has been a strong quarter. We continue to make steady progress in our safety culture and we provided impressive reliability for our customers despite a record-setting heat wave. We also achieved a number of positive regulatory outcomes, including the General Rate Case and the Cost of Capital decisions, which provide a solid foundation for the investments we will be making in our system.","With that, let me thank you for joining us and let me turn things over to David to walk us through the financials.","David S. Thomason - PG&E Corp.","Thank you, Geisha, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by covering our second quarter results and then provide a couple of updates to our guidance for 2017.","Slide 4 shows our results for the second quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $0.86. GAAP earnings, including items impacting comparability, are also shown here. Pipeline related expenses were $29 million pre-tax for the quarter. Our legal and regulatory related expenses came in at $3 million pre-tax. For the Butte fire, we recorded insurance recoveries of $46 million pre-tax this quarter, including the receipt of $32 million from one of our contractor's insurers. This was partially offset by legal cost of $17 million for a net favorable impact of $29 million pre-tax for the quarter. Finally, we have a new item this quarter related to charges associated with the planned closure of Diablo Canyon.","During the quarter, we reached a settlement with parties in our joint proposal to retire Diablo Canyon along with several other intervenors which provides clarity on the recovery of previously incurred license renewal costs and costs incurred for projects that will be canceled as a result of the retirement. As part of that settlement agreement, we have recorded a $47 million pre-tax charge for the unrecoverable portion of these costs in the second quarter. This settlement agreement was filed with the CPUC in May and we expect the final decision later this year.","Moving on, slide 5 shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations of $0.66 in Q2 last year and $0.86 in Q2 of this year. Consistent with last quarter, we were $0.15 favorable due to the timing of 2015 GT&S rate case decision, which was received in August of last year. This year-to-date favorable variance of roughly $0.30 will fully reverse in the fourth quarter. Rate base earnings were $0.07 for the quarter. Since we did not receive the 2017 GRC decision until May of this year, our second quarter results reflect two quarters of incremental GRC rate base earnings.","You can expect to see about $0.05 in rate base earnings for each of the next two quarters for a total of $0.20 for the full year. A number of small miscellaneous items totaled $0.04 positive for the quarter, most of which is timing related and is expected to reverse by year end. There were two additional items from the 2017 GRC decision that contributed to a negative $0.04. As we mentioned last year, our GRC revenues were adjusted in 2017, resulting in a loss of incremental tax repair benefits of roughly $0.25 annually, including $0.07 this quarter. This was partially offset by $0.03 favorable for incremental revenues to recover depreciation and interest costs that we incurred in the first quarter. Lastly, we had $0.02 negative related to the issuance of shares.","Transitioning now to slide 6. Today, we are reaffirming our guidance for earnings from operations of $3.55 to $3.75 per share.","On slide 7, we've outlined the underlying assumptions for that guidance. I'll reiterate that it remains our objective to earn the CPUC authorized return on equity across the enterprise in 2017. One adjustment to our plan that I'll note here is we are reducing our 2017 CapEx range from approximately $6 billion to roughly $5.9 billion, which primarily reflects the shift in some of our gas transmission and distribution work into 2018. At the same time, we have increased the CapEx forecast for 2018 to $6.1 billion on slide 10 to reflect this adjustment.","Turning now to slide 8. There are a few changes in our items impacting comparability in 2017. Butte fire-related insurance recoveries, net of legal costs, reflect recorded proceeds and costs through the second quarter. The shareholder derivative settlement was approved by the court on July 18 and we expect to record a net benefit of $65 million pre-tax in the third quarter. Lastly, we've included the $47 million from the Diablo Canyon-related charges that I mentioned earlier.","Moving now to slide 9, I'm pleased to share that the high-end of our equity range has decreased from $600 million to $500 million. With two quarters under our belt, we have better line of sight into our financing plans for the year, coupled with a shift in some capital to 2018.","On slides 10 and 11, we've updated our CapEx and rate base to reflect the changes I shared earlier. Additionally, as Geisha mentioned, we filed our TO19 case with FERC yesterday, which includes a roughly $200 million increase to CapEx over our TO17 settlement. This is reflected in the high end of our CapEx and rate base ranges.","Finally, let's move on to slide 12. At the end of May, we announced that we are raising our quarterly dividend $0.04 to $0.53 per share. On an annual basis, this increases our dividend by 8% from $1.96 per share to $2.12 per share. This is another step in our commitment to target a 60% dividend payout ratio by 2019.","I'll close by echoing Geisha's comments about how pleased we are with the results this quarter. We had favorable regulatory decisions in two of our most important cases, the General Rate Case and Cost to Capital, great reliability despite a record heat wave and we're continuing to provide shareholder value with another increase to our dividend. We continue to be confident in our ability to deliver on our plans as we evolve with a changing energy landscape. And while we aren't providing guidance beyond 2017, our objective is to earn the recently authorized return on equity across the enterprise for 2018 and 2019.","With that, let's open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Good morning.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Could you just speak to what's driving the delay in the gas spending, the $100 million that you moved around from 2017 into 2018?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Jonathan, this is Jason. It really is \u2013 we started to bundle some of our work in our gas transmission and distribution business so that we can better execute that work. As a result, this is really just sort of a timing shift where the final execution and work will fall into 2018. That's why we're really just highlighting its timing in nature.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And the lower equity is sort of partly that and partly other things by the sound of it.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","That's right. I mean, we have better visibility to our financing plan with two quarters under our belt. So we have a final decision in the GRC. We've resolved a number of our pending items impacting comparability which we started the year with. So we have a better line of sight to the equity needs for the full year here in 2017.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So, I'm trying not to ask something else that will burn up Jason's voice, but on Diablo, obviously you have the settlement under the charge this quarter. Can you talk about where that proceeding sits? And I remember there was a piece of it that used to relate to kind of replacement that got pulled out of the current case. And is this \u2013 should we view this charge as sort of the end of the first phase effectively and how do we think about the second phase?","Steven E. Malnight - PG&E Corp.","Jon, this is Steve Malnight. In terms of where the proceeding sits, yes, the record in the proceeding is now closed and we're awaiting a proposed decision from the judge. It has evolved and changed pretty substantially since it was originally filed.","So as you noted, we filed the settlement with the joint parties to withdraw some of the procurement that we had proposed to do in this proceeding and instead defer that to the commission's integrated resource plan proceeding. So we still have the energy efficiency replacement that is in this case but we've deferred the remainder to the IRP. In the case we still have a cost for employee retention programs as well as the retraining programs. We have the community mitigation payments that we proposed. And as David mentioned in the call, we recently filed an additional settlement that resolved some of the uncertainty around \u2013 that would resolve some of the uncertainty around both the license cost recovery as well as canceled projects. So at this point we're awaiting proposed decision from the judge on all those items.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. You may proceed.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much. Hi guys.","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Hello.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","My first \u2013 sorry. So my first question was on the power indifference charge or indifference adjustment around CCAs. Just want to understand a little bit more around the progress on that and when do you see timing of something happening around adjustments for that case? And how do you think that plays out over time.","Steven E. Malnight - PG&E Corp.","Yes, so this is Steve Malnight again. Let me just give a quick update on that. As we mentioned in the original proceeding, the Power Cost (sic) [Charge] Indifference Adjustment, or PCIA, is really designed to ensure that the state law is fulfilled to maintain indifference as some customers choose to leave bundled service and go to either CCAs or direct access. As we have pointed out and as I think the joint utilities pointed out, the current mechanism as it stands today does not fully allocate those costs.","So for us, about 35% of those costs really remain with bundled customers, which needs to be corrected as CCAs continue to become a bigger and bigger part of the load. With the PCIA OIR that the commission recently launched, we view that as a real positive. The commission has clearly recognized the need for reform in that proceeding and has laid out some guiding principles that highlight the need to really maintain what we call bundled customer indifference, which ensures that the state law is followed.","So the commission has not yet issued a schedule, but in many different proceedings in areas they have mentioned the desire to handle this on an expedited basis and move through that quickly. So we're very hopeful that that comes to pass. And we'll see and follow this proceeding as it goes. I would expect it will hopefully be resolved sometime in 2018.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Thanks, guys. And then secondly, on the cost of capital, I know we have the good outcome around the 2019 timeframe. But just to understand from an ROE perspective and your authorized equity perspective, do you think that will be tougher to maintain your authorized equity at current levels going forward? And in terms of ROEs, do you think there's a risk at that time in terms of where the ROEs come out and how you think that plays out?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Praful, this is Jason. I think it's way too early to tell. I mean clearly when we litigate cost of capital, they're going to look at the equity ratio, they will look at our return on equity, they will look at the adjustment mechanism. But frankly, I think it's just way too early in that process to think about what's going to happen two years down the road.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Fair enough. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. A couple of CapEx questions. Just in the TO cases, and if you don't mind to address TO18 and TO19, the one that just got filed, what is the CapEx for those TO cases relative, I think it's to the roughly $1.1 billion that you're assuming in 2017?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Hi, Michael, this is Jason. In TO18, we filed for a CapEx of $1.3 billion. As you know, that case is still pending. Hearing is the next \u2013 the first quarter next year. Currently, we're forecasting spend for this year in our electric transmission business of $1.1 billion. That compares to what we filed in TO19 of CapEx of $1.4 billion.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So you filed for TO18 of $1.3 billion, TO19 of $1.4 billion. If you were to actually get that CapEx spend, that adds another $500 million to $600 million to your CapEx and then after bonus P&A, all that good stuff, it kind of creates an uplift potentially to rate base.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","It does create potential upside, but obviously we're going to have to work through the hearings process in that we just filed the TO19 case. So I have to work through what we anticipate to be settlement discussions early on and I think a lot of this will be tied up to the resolution of TO18.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. And finally, Geisha, when you look at other opportunities for rate base growth, and you've laid several out on the slides, which ones do you think have the potential to be the most material? Meaning, when I think about it on a dollar of capital invested, which ones do you see that are not in your current CapEx forecast or you can see, hey, that can wind up being a pretty big number over time?","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Yeah, you know the ones we've talked about historically which are outside this period is, what ultimately happens with high-speed rail, what ultimately happens with some of these really large state-sponsored projects. I think that provides an opportunity. More near term, I continue to think that there's great opportunity around electrification of transportation. I think at this continued improvement or opportunity for us to continue making investments and our bread-and-butter work, modernizing the electric lines and modernizing our pipes. So longer term, it's the things that are outside the range like the high-speed rail. Short term, it's our bread-and-butter work.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. You may proceed.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning. Just quickly, you talk about our earnings at 10.4% on the entire enterprise. As you shift into a lower ROE with this cost of capital extension, is that a good metric to use for the whole enterprise earning at 10.25% or do we expect, as Michael just brought up, as the transmission rate base maybe continues to grow has the ability to earn above the 10.25%?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","We're still signaling to earn the CPUC authorized return on equity in 2018 and 2019 which is 10.25%. We did file a TO19 for 10.75%. That's the 10.25% plus the 50 basis point adder that are for participating in the competitive transmission process. But the electric transmission rate base still represents a little less than 20% of the overall rate base. So that differential isn't very significant to earnings.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. And I hope you feel better, Jason.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with MorningStar Capital Group. You may proceed.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Good morning. Thank you. You answered my primary question on Diablo Canyon earlier. But we step back and think about the next however many years here before the proposed closure. At what point do you get clarity in terms of recovering any kind of stranded capital cost that haven't been depreciated or then potentially a bigger issue on the decommissioning costs?","Steven E. Malnight - PG&E Corp.","Hey Travis, this is Steve Malnight again. So thanks for the question. I should say another important part of the existing proposal that I failed to mention before actually is the mechanism to ensure that the rate base for Diablo Canyon is appropriately depreciated through the rest of its useful life. So under our proposal, we will put in place the mechanisms to ensure that the depreciation is fully recovered in that plant by the time it shuts down. So that's part of the proposal we have now.","On the decommissioning, as you know, that's going to be a very long-term endeavor at Diablo Canyon as we go through that. We have regular proceedings to look at the cost of decommissioning. We recently had the decision in the current case that did not fully support our estimated cost. But we will have the opportunity in 2018 to come back and re-file that. And as a part of our plans for decommissioning, we're now going to be conducting a site-specific study, which will look in detail at the estimated cost. So we will be litigating that again in 2018.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. And when you talk about the fully recovered depreciation over this next period if you receive this terms of settlement, it would accounting-wise increase depreciation but then you'd collect those back from ratepayers through higher rates, is that what happened on a very high level?","David S. Thomason - PG&E Corp.","This is David Thomason. We've already actually been depreciating Diablo to fully recover the asset balance by the end of its current license term, so there is no increase necessarily in depreciation as a result of that path.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. So it would be at a zero rate base number by that time?","David S. Thomason - PG&E Corp.","Correct. So $2.2 billion roughly in Diablo rate base today, we hope to be or plan to be at zero by the end of the current license term.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Got it. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium Fund Management. You may proceed.","Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP","Thank you. My questions have been answered. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you.","Ann Kim - PG&E Corp.","All right. Well, this is Ann. It appears we have gone through the queue of questions. So thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning.

All lines will be muted during the presentation portions of our call, with an opportunity for questions and answers at the end. At this time, I would like to turn it over to our host, Janet Loduca. Thanks and enjoy your conference. You may proceed.","Janet C. Loduca - Vice President-Investor Relations","Great. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Before you hear from Tony Earley, Chris Johns and Kent Harvey, I'll remind you that our discussion today includes forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results, based on assumptions, forecasts, expectations and information currently available to management. Some of the important factors that could affect the company's actual financial results are described on the second page of today's slide presentation. We also encourage you to review the Form 10-Q that will be filed with the SEC later today and the discussion of risk factors that appears there and in the 2014 Annual Report.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Tony.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you, Janet, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start by covering the leadership changes that we announced recently and also provide some regulatory updates. Chris will talk about operational results and Kent will cover our financials later.","So, a couple weeks ago we announced that Geisha Williams and Nick Stavropoulos, will be assuming the roles of Presidents of Electric Operations and Gas Operations respectively effective August 17.","First, I really do want to thank Chris for his leadership at PG&E. Chris has been a passionate sponsor of our efforts to improve the safety culture at PG&E. And since I arrived almost four years ago, he has been a great partner for me in improving PG&E's operations. So thank you Chris for all that you have done. Geisha Williams joined PG&E in 2007 from Florida Power & Light. And under her leadership, PG&E has dramatically improved its electric reliability while managing the increasingly complex demands in our group.","Nick Stavropoulos joined PG&E in 2011 from National Grid and under his leadership PG&E has completed an unprecedented amount of work to improve the safety of our gas system and has employed new innovative technologies that are literally changing the industry. Geisha and Nick are both here with us today, and they'll be available to answer any questions that you've got.","While we're proud of the progress we've made to date, we also know that we have more work to do. We remain focused on continuing to strengthen our safety culture, resolving the remaining San Bruno related proceedings, and rebuilding trust with our stakeholders, including the CPUC. We're also focused on planning for California's clean energy future, and we've had a number of significant developments on that front since our last call that I'd like to touch on now.","Earlier, this month we filed our electric distribution resources plan. This plan outlined our strategy for continuing to enable California's ambitious environmental goals, by building a flexible, reliable grid that meets the growing demand for distributed generation, electric vehicles, energy efficiency and energy storage.","We've been investing in grid modernization for several years now, and will include the next round of investments in our 2017 General Rate Case filing that will come in September. Earlier this month, the CPUC also approved changes to our residential rates that will reduce the number of tiers from 4 tiers to 2 tiers, decrease the differential between the tiers, and establish a $10 minimum bill for most customers.","While this is an important first step, we believe that additional rate reform is critical to fully realize the state's objectives, and ensure that all customers are appropriately paying for the use of the electric grid. We were a little disappointed that the commission didn't adopt fixed charges, but we are encouraged that the final decision recognized the importance of cost-based rates to send the appropriate price signals. We'll be proposing additional enhancements in the future to bring us closer to that goal.","We'll also be submitting our proposal for new net energy metering rates next week, which is another important component of aligning rates with costs. Solar is an essential part of California's clean energy future, but we need smart energy reform for it to grow sustainably.","The CPUC also issued a revised schedule in our Gas Transmission and Storage rate case. We'll now have two separate decisions, one that decides what costs are authorized and then a second decision that decides how we will apply the $850 million San Bruno penalty for safety related work.","And Kent is going to discuss the financial implications of that new schedule in just a minute. Finally, today we filed our TO17 rate case. Our request was about $300 million higher than TO16.","So, with that, let me turn it over to Chris.","Christopher P. Johns - President, Pacific Gas & Electric Co.","Great. Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. We had another strong quarter in operations. We continue to perform well in our public safety metrics, in fact we reduced the numbers of wires down and gas dig-ins across our system and we're responding to emergencies at an industry leading pace. Inline pipeline inspections and upgrades are a little behind due to permitting delays, but we anticipate catching up by the end of the year and Diablo Canyon continues to perform very well. You can see our overall performance on key metrics in the appendices.","In May, we successfully conducted a two day large scale exercise to test our preparedness and response plans for a major earthquake. It was our most ambitious exercise to date with over 750 employees and nearly a dozen external stakeholders participating across our service territory. Exercises like these along with our many other emergency preparedness efforts help us to be ready to respond quickly and effectively when an event happens.","With California in its fourth year of severe drought, our electric operations team has significantly enhanced our efforts to prevent wildfires. We're conducting daily aerial fire patrols across our service territory and we've partnered with federal and state agencies like CAL FIRE and the U.S. Forest Service to create more firebreaks, improve emergency response and fund the cameras that will help detect wildfires in remote locations. We're also continuing to manage water in our own hydro system to help meet the peak load this summer.","In early July, the CPUC released the results of an independent report on the Fresno pipeline incident, which found that the pipeline ruptured when it was struck by third party construction equipment. The report also confirmed that the pipe met all industry specifications and that the construction activity significantly reduced the depth of soil around the pipeline. This incident highlights the importance of calling 811 before digging and we've been working hard to make sure all our customers are aware of this free service. We're continuing to cooperate with the CPUC in its ongoing investigation. And our thoughts remain with the victims and families of this accident. Finally, earlier this quarter, the National Transportation Safety Board announced that PG&E has successfully completed the tenth of 12 safety recommendations for the improvements we've made to the system that monitors and provides real-time data about our gas pipelines. The two remaining recommendations which involve strength testing and valve installation, are proceeding appropriately.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Kent.","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Chris. And good morning. I'll start with our quarterly results, which are summarized on slide five. Earnings from operations came in at $0.91 in the second quarter. GAAP earnings which include our items impacting comparability were $0.83.","Our pipeline-related expenses totaled $15 million pre-tax or $9 million after tax, as shown in the table. This includes our costs to remediate encroachments on our pipeline rights of way and some remaining expense work for our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan.","Our legal and regulatory-related expenses totaled $16 million pre-tax or $10 million after tax in the table. Here we have our costs for litigation and enforcement activities related to natural gas matters and regulatory communications.","Fines and penalties for the second quarter totaled $75 million pre-tax, as shown in the table below. You can see the Q2 charge was for disallowed capital work coming out of the final penalty decision in the San Bruno investigations. Disallowed capital work will continue to be recorded as an item impacting comparability in future periods as the capital is spent. But disallowed expense work won't be reflected as an item impacting comparability until the revenues are disallowed in the gas transmission rate case. So the timing there will be linked to the final decision.","Finally, as you can see in the table above, we received insurance recoveries during the quarter of $39 million pre-tax or $23 million after-tax in the table. This brings our total insurance recoveries for third-party claims to $505 million pre-tax.","Slide six shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations and the key factors that take us from $0.69 in Q2 last year to $0.91 in Q2 this year. $0.21 of the increase was due to the 2014 General Rate Case decision, which you'll remember we didn't receive until Q3 of last year. In addition, $0.05 of the increase was due to growth in rate base earnings and $0.04 was associated with tax timing. We expect the tax timing to reverse to zero by year end. We also had $0.06 positive in miscellaneous smaller items.","These factors were partially offset by $0.09 of lower cost recovery due to the timing of the gas transmission rate case. As you know, the revenue increase from a final decision in the case will be retroactive to January 1. There was also $0.03 attributable to the disposition of stock in SolarCity in Q2 last year. And $0.02 attributable to an increase in shares outstanding. That's it for our Q2 results.","I'll now move on to our 2015 guidance summarized on slide seven. As Tony mentioned, the CPUC issued a revised schedule in the gas transmission rate case. Since it now appears likely that the case will not be resolved until 2016, we don't expect to be able to book additional gas transmission revenues this year. I indicated on our last call that not receiving a final rate case decision in 2015 would impact earnings from operations this year by about $0.60 per share.","Accordingly, we're adjusting our guidance for 2015 earnings from operations to reflect this delay, which takes us to a range of $2.90 to $3.10 for this year. The prior range was $3.50 to $3.70.","Since the final decision will be retroactive to January 1, 2015, this is just a timing issue. And next year we would expect to book incremental revenues for both 2015 and 2016. We plan to treat the 2015 amount as an item impacting comparability next year and the 2016 amount will be included in our operating results.","The delay in the rate case decision affects two of the assumptions underlying our 2015 earnings guidance. So I want to just briefly touch on those and then we'll come back to the items impacting comparability.","On slide eight, we've adjusted our 2015 CapEx for gas transmission given the delay in the case. We're now showing $650 million versus a previous range of $600 million to $800 million. We've also reduced our 2015 authorized rate base for gas transmission to $1.8 billion since the increase in authorized rate base won't occur until next year when we get a final decision. The other assumptions here are unchanged from last quarter.","Moving to slide nine, the ranges for the items impacting comparability are also unchanged from last quarter with the exception of the fines and penalties, which we've reduced from roughly $1 billion to about $900 million for 2015. The delay in the gas transmission rate case means we'll not report disallowed expense work until next year when we get the decision. We previously had $160 million in 2015 guidance for that. Partially offsetting that change, we've increased our 2015 estimate for disallowed capital by about $50 million to $400 million. The net of these two changes is a reduction in 2015 fines and penalties of about $100 million.","I also need to remind you here that our estimate does not include other potential fines and penalties such as any revenues disallowed in the gas transmission rate case as a penalty for ex parte communications.","Finally in the table above, we've also updated it to reflect the receipt of the insurance recoveries that we booked in Q2.","Slide 10 just shows you how you get from the roughly $900 million estimate for 2015 to the total $1.6 billion of fines and penalties coming out of the gas investigations. This table has been updated to reflect the timing changes I just covered.","Moving on to slide 11, our total equity needs for 2015 remained unchanged at between $700 and $800 million. In the second quarter, we issued about $100 million of equity through our internal programs, which include our 401(k) and dividend reinvestment programs. And we expect to issue a total of roughly $300 million through these programs for the full year. We previously issued about $75 million through our continuous equity offering, leaving the remaining need for the year at about $300 million to $400 million, and that's unchanged from last quarter.","Slides 12 and 13 just summarize our assumptions for CapEx and rate base through 2016. Other than the change to 2015 authorized rate base, which I've already covered, the numbers are unchanged from last quarter.","With that, I'll stop here and we can open-up the lines for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse. You may proceed.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Dan.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, just on the \u2013 just to make sure I had this right. So in 2016 you guys will not include the $0.60 in recurring numbers. So a 2016 estimate was recently published and what you're going to talk about then would look like some sort of a function of a return on rate base plus any tax benefits you guys get from the manufacturing deductions?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, Dan. I think you have that correct. We just \u2013 we want to make sure that we're pulling out the 2015 amount as we think it makes next year more comparable.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then, on the \u2013 just on the timing of GT&S kind of if you look at the proceedings as laid out and where flex points or where debates are going to be, when do you guys anticipate us getting to a clean number? And when will you give guidance for 2016 in that context?","Dinyar B. Mistry - Vice President & Controller","Hi, Dan. This is Dinyar Mistry, the Controller. I think, when we look at the procedural schedule, it seems that early 2016 maybe around the January timeframe is when we would expect to see the first decision and the second decision will probably follow maybe a couple of months or three months after that.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And when do you guys think about giving guidance around those numbers? So, when are you going to give 2016 guidance, I guess?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Don't know for sure, Dan, but on a normal schedule we probably do that in February when we announce year-end earnings.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Would you be comfortable doing that before GT&S is done?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, if the schedule ends up playing out as Dinyar just described, you would at least have the first part of the decision, which is authorized revenues, which you wouldn't really have it how they're treating all the fines and penalties, I think we could make our way through that.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Very good. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","So, when we think about the guidance origin for this year, very simply it's the not getting the revenues from the GT&S case offset by the tweaks and the timing on the fines and penalties to get to that new range, everything else is basically the same?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. I think that's pretty much it.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay, great. The second question was on \u2013 you're not presuming any incremental equity need this year versus your last update, clearly the one big change is going to be a cash flow, deferral of recovery of these cash flows through these cases done, should we just assume your funding with short-term debt until you get the money in?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well Greg, this is Kent again. There's kind of two things that have happened in terms of a few factors that result in not really a material change in our equity needs. One is, you're right, the GT&S case has been delayed until early next year. But we weren't anticipating it to actually happen anyway until very late this year. So it really only affected our equity balances for a few months, this year. So moving it out of this year isn't a big 2015 impact on our equity. And then in the other direction of course, we're not expecting to have the charge for the disallowed expense work this year and previously, we were. So that actually helps the equity balances a little this year and the net of those two is not a significant change.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. So the \u2013 and to the extent those cash flows are pushed out a few months you have obviously sufficient balance sheet capacity to fund that right?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, and there's really no cash flow impact this year, it will all be in the next year just in terms of the timing of when the actual decision is made and we start collecting the revenues through cash rates.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Gordon. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Quick one and just the pushback with the GT&S case change you're thinking at all Tony about timing for revisiting the dividend? And then just give us an update on that process?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, I mean, let me reiterate. I mean we know the dividend is very important, we've been focused on that. Obviously with the change in the timing of that case that does change things. Our commitment is to continue to figure out what would be an appropriate time to deal with the dividend, we're having ongoing discussions here internally, but I don't have a projection of exactly when that might be yet.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. But is it reasonable to expect it's more like a 2016 event now and then given more you've just said?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think that's a reasonable assumption for you.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then, just on the miscellaneous items in the quarter, I mean, it seems to add up to quite a big number. Was there anything particularly worth calling out?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Jonathan, this is Kent. The miscellaneous by definition usually ends up being lots of small items and some of them can be timing and some of them aren't necessarily timing. In Q2, we did have a couple of settlements with contractors, litigation settlements so that added to the quarter compared to what we would normally see, and then there are some smaller items in there too. And I would say, overall it's always hard for us to forecast miscellaneous by their very nature, but we expect we may have a few offsets in miscellaneous later this year.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you, Kent. On the similar subject, you said you thought the tax item would reverse by the end of the year, would that be in Q3 and Q4 or sort of between the two quarters?","Dinyar B. Mistry - Vice President & Controller","This is Dinyar, Jonathan. They should reverse over the next set of quarters.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. As in the next \u2013 the next two quarters or is it some of it slip into next year?","Dinyar B. Mistry - Vice President & Controller","No, it should all reverse this year. So, the reason that we have it is that accounting rules require companies to use a consistent effective tax rate every quarter, but your income isn't consistent each quarter. And so, you have this timing issue that reverses itself out by the end of the year.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for the clarity.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Arnold. Our next question comes from the line of Leslie Rich with JPMorgan. You may proceed.","Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. I wondered if you could talk a bit about some of the rate design issues you mentioned, I know you've got a final decision on that did not allow an immediate fixed charge, but you said you were going to submit a new proposal for net metering, I wondered what that might look like?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think the decision that came down moved this in the right direction cutting down the number of tiers. It did go with a minimum bill charge rather than a fixed charge. We, of course, had advocated for a fixed charge. But we're moving in the right direction. The next step will be a net energy meter rate filing. And in that filing, we're going to make sure that we underscore that we continue to support rooftop solar. We have the largest number of rooftop solar installations in the country. It's now over 175,000 installations. But we also need to keep investing in the grid. So we'll submit a proposal that will allow us to reinvest in the grid at the same time we're supporting rooftop solar. And that filing should be coming out in the next week or so.","Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.","And then, did you make a filing in July maybe you call it the Grid of Things, there's a bullet point there on sort of longer-term grid infrastructure improvement, and I think you said you would lump that in with your next rate case. Have you quantified that?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We haven't yet, I mean, our distribution resource plan filing kind of outlines our strategy on the grid. And as I think we said in prior calls, we've already made lots of investments starting with virtually 100% coverage on our automated meter reading program. And our next filing will have a substantial chunk of investment for continuing the transformation of the grid to a 21st Century grid. I can't really quantify how much of it is grid development versus how much of it is going to be routine maintenance of existing equipment yet.","Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.","But it's fair to say that spending would be 2017 and beyond?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Ms. Rich. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi, good morning. Just first on the equity issuance. So it seems like you've only done about a third of the equity for the year. Is there any reason that you kind of haven't done it more prorated? And how should we think about the way you're likely to do the $300 million to $400 million not through programs?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Steve, as you might imagine, I am reluctant to really comment a lot on what our equity plans are. I just don't think that's going to serve us well. So I will tell you, I'm very confident we have more than adequate tools and the amount that we need to raise this year is quite manageable.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And any more clarity on \u2013 I know this year there was a lot of that tax cash flow coming in. And is there any more sense on kind of tax cash flows in 2016 that you can provide us? Or at least are the cash flows that are coming this year going to reverse next year, going to stay stable or continue to be a positive?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Steve, I think you're referring to balancing account activities, which was one of many drivers maybe in our cash flows.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","That's correct.","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I don't really have anything to add to what was discussed on the last call since then. And I just continue to point out that our balancing accounts are very complex. It's very hard to look on our balance sheet and really decipher all the things that are going on because we have longer term balancing accounts and shorter term ones. Sometimes the trends have to do with prior years and then you're reversing them. Sometimes they have to do with what's going on in the current period and they amortize over different periods. So I just think it's going to be a very difficult path to try to do analytics to figure out how that drives our financing needs. And so I think that the easiest way to get to the big picture is to focus on year-over-year CapEx changes. And obviously, we've had the fines and penalties we're financing, and those are a few of the key drivers.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Last question is just for Tony. Obviously, you announced some management responsibility changes a few weeks ago. Could you maybe talk a little bit in context of Chris leaving, and then, I'm not sure you're going to be there till you're 100. So thoughts on kind of succession planning?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. When I came I said I thought it would be three years to five years. Obviously, with Chris' announcement, things have changed. What I am committed to is making sure that we have a strong leadership team in place. I think with the changes that we announced a few weeks ago. We've got some great leaders now in place going forward. But I'm committed to make sure that we've got a good plan. I continue to discuss that with our board. Plus my wife and I like it here. Sarah and I just bought a place here in San Francisco, which I've got to move into later this week, which I'm not looking forward to the move. But I'm committed to making sure that we've got strong leadership to continue the momentum we've got in place.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Fleishman. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS. You may proceed.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. It's Julien here.","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","So first question just going back to tax issues. In terms of the deductibility from any penalties, could you talk to some of the proposed state legislations specifically the state taxes?","Dinyar B. Mistry - Vice President & Controller","Hi, Julien, this is Dinyar again. So, you're right that there was a proposal that was introduced in the California Legislature, I think it was in the last week of June, and what that would do would potentially disallow the deduction for the penalty for the San Bruno penalty for California tax purposes.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Right. Do you have any sense of what that would be in terms of the total bill? I know that it's not the federal number, it's the state number, so it's also considerably smaller?","Dinyar B. Mistry - Vice President & Controller","Yeah, yeah. So on a really high level, it's up to a $1.6 billion penalty; $300 million was a fine. So, that would not be deductible anyway, and our state tax rate is roughly 10%.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So, it's fair to just take 10%?","Dinyar B. Mistry - Vice President & Controller","Yeah.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And then going back to Leslie's question and trying to get a little bit more of a holistic understanding on how you're thinking about net energy metering and compensation as we go into the second stage or second round here. Broadly, is the thought process here to bring down compensation to the solar sector in tandem with the cost structure declines that we're seeing? I'm just kind of getting a sense as to how you're thinking about at least structurally approaching the question? Would there be some kind of or is the thought process devising some kind of tracker to bring down NEM over time? I know you can't exactly say what the NEM rate would be, but just holistically how we think about that next year and in subsequent years?","Steven E. Malnight - Senior Vice President-Regulatory Affairs, Pacific Gas & Electric Co.","Yeah, hi, this is Steve Malnight from the Regulatory Affairs team. I think, Tony talked a little bit about the approach on NEM, and I think you know it's important to recognize that the existing structure allows customers to get credits at a full retail rate. I think it's been very successful in California in helping the solar market grow and advance. And as we now look forward, our goal would be to better balance both ensuring we have sustainable opportunities for solar to grow in the state, which I think is an option customers want and that we think is a vital part of meeting the energy goals in the state, and at the same time, start to shift that \u2013 shift the way we structure our compensation for NEM customers. So we'll be filing an updated tariff in the new proposal, I think we'll see a lot of proposals from multiple parties and the commission will work through that and make that decision and we'll participate in that proceeding.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","But nothing necessarily formulaic.","Steven E. Malnight - Senior Vice President-Regulatory Affairs, Pacific Gas & Electric Co.","I think, we'll have to see how all the different proposals come out, I think there will be a lot and there will be opportunities for the commission to look for how we make changes now and into the future.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Weinstein. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Congrats on a good quarter. Real quick question for you \u2013 just one on slide 12 related to CapEx. I want to make sure I understand this, the $5.5 billion in 2015, and the range you give in 2016, that includes the funds you'll spend the $400 million in 2015, and $300 million in 2016, that will get disallowed?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Michael, this is Kent; that's correct.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Second, any update on the insurance recoveries in terms of what you think you might be able to recover or what you've requested for recovery versus what you've recovered to date. I'm just trying to kind of think about that from a cash on cash impact?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Michael, we're not totally done with insurance recoveries, but the vast majority of the claims are resolved at this point.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And one final one, when you get the GT&S case, and we get to February, at the yearend earnings call and you think about giving 2016 guidance, is your thought process you'll give a multiyear view at that stage?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Michael, we're still working through that on our end exactly what we're going to do for guidance next year.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks, guys. Once again, congrats.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Lapides. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Wanted to touch on the longer term in terms of you think about your total growth outlook in spending. You obviously laid out a lot of interesting information in your filing about the long-term resource need. At a high level as you think about the growth outlook that that provides you, how do you think about that compared to historical levels of spend? What could be the key sort of up and down drivers that could take you lower than you expect or higher than you expect when we think about it's a little challenging given all the possible areas of spend in the future, given all the greatest change, I'm just curious if you could speak to that at a high level.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, as Kent said, we're not giving future guidance yet. But I think, it's fair to say and we said this in the past that our capital investments going forward will be higher than our historic levels and consistent with what we've had in the last two or three years where we've been investing in our electric grid. We've been investing in our gas system. And while there are obviously going to be changes as we see particularly the Grid of Things develop and how fast we need to invest in the grid. But I think you can \u2013 you will see a significant amount of capital investment going forward. You can see that slide12 shows our estimate for 2016. Beyond that, I think we're going to see some things that are comparable to it and we'll talk as we get further out as to more specifics.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. And then shifting over to solar and thinking about the outlook there, as you've looked at bill increases over time, what have you been thinking of in turn as you think about the changes to your customers' bills, what kind of growth in solar do you expect and what have you factored into your thinking on where the bill goes, just given obviously, that there is a shift in costs from the solar customers to the remaining customers?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well let me start off by saying, one of the key focus areas that I've had since I've been here. I talked about safety, affordability, clean, safety, reliability, clean energy and affordability. And so, we have a very aggressive continuous improvement program in place and our teams are delivering on that to mitigate the cost of the investment. But obviously, given the capital investments that we're making we continue to see upward movement on our rates. But we're sensitive to the subsidies that I think the net energy metering proposal that we'll make, we'll try and bring more in line the amount we're paying for the solar that we're receiving, in line with the value to the rest of the customers so that it reduces the subsidies. But we continue to see very healthy growth of solar in California, both at the utility scale and at the rooftop distributed generation to solar scale. Steve, I don't know if you want to add any more about, to that.","Steven E. Malnight - Senior Vice President-Regulatory Affairs, Pacific Gas & Electric Co.","Tony I'll just say again, I think that we've recognized throughout that solar is a vital part of achieving a lot of goals that California has for our energy policy. We're supportive of that and as we do look at rate changes be it in the residential rates or in the NEM proceeding, one of the goals is to make sure that solar can continue to grow sustainably. And I think that's the goal and that's something we see going into the future.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Understood. And it sounds like you do continue to forecast in a fairly rapid growth in solar as you think about the overall customer bill, but obviously you're going to try that modify how things are working to make it more rational and have costs bear things appropriately for solar?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, that's correct. And then as I said before, we've actually made progress on the rate structure. So reducing the number of tiers from four to two is helpful and we'll continue to keep working the rate issue because I think everyone agrees that we need to get to more cost base rates, in fact in the commission decision, they reaffirmed the belief in cost based rates to just \u2013 we may have disagreements over how fast we get there.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Byrd. Our next question comes from the line of Hugh Wynne with Bernstein Research. You may proceed.","Hugh de Neufville Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. I'd like to also follow up on some of the previous questions. Especially what is your target for annual increases in the per kilowatt-hour rate and then the average customer bill. You have a rate of increase relative to the rate of inflation that you would like to achieve?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Our target over the long-term is to track the rate of inflation for our rate increases. Obviously it's chunky and we're on a three-year rate cycle with our GRC, our General Rate Case and so you tend to see a spike up. And then, it slows down and then you get the next filing. We will make our next GRC filing here this fall. And that won't go into effect for more than a year. So you see those kind of bumps. But our long-range target is to get that those rate increases around the rate of inflation over a longer period of time.","Hugh de Neufville Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, also following up on the prior discussion of the net energy metering case, would it be possible for you to maybe just sketch out the positions that you believe will be put forward in that case? I'm interested in your views, for example, whether you believe that they'll be focused solely on a net energy metering construct? Or whether parties in the case will look to move in the direction of a value for energy supplied? Whether others will look for a feed-in tariff? Can you perhaps discuss where you think the different proposals will fall out?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm reluctant to speculate on what others are doing. I think we'll probably see all of those things included in the various filings. As I said before, our focus is going to be on the value we get for electricity that is being supplied to us and getting it more aligned with the value to other customers. But I'm sure we're going to see a range of proposals from the various parties. But I can't speculate on exactly which ones.","Hugh de Neufville Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Wynne. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill with Barclays. You may proceed.","Gregg Gillander Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. Just a follow-up on slide 10. You talked about essentially moving $100 million of shareholder impact is from the disallowed capital and pipeline safety expenses out into future periods. Is it possible to lay out how that would track 2016 and beyond?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","This is Kent. A you know, because we discussed it on the last call, all of our estimates here about timing and the actual costs we're incurring, they're based on estimates because the PUC has not yet decided, specifically, which costs will account as safety related. So we've been using our best estimates of which categories, and this chart reflects that. And based on our estimates, we would expect that most of what you see there in estimated future periods is what would actually happened in 2016. Again, whether or not it plays out that way will largely depend on the final PUC determination of which ones count.","Gregg Gillander Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with Mizuho. You may proceed.","James D. von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.","Hi, good morning, everyone. A simple question, following up on the dividend. In 2016, do you think your GAAP earnings per share will exceed your current dividend level?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Jim, this is Kent. We're not giving you a GAAP guidance for 2016. So you can do that calculation yourself.","James D. von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.","I tried. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. You may proceed.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just a couple of quick questions. On the felony case, there's a story about you guys making efforts under statute of limitations, basically that you guys are arguing that under the statute of limitation, the whole bunch of these charges don't apply \u2013 or violations. Could you elaborate on that and how much that might change the outcome of the course of the case if you guys succeed with that?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'll let Hyun Park comment in a minute. But between now and of course the scheduled trial date is next spring. And obviously, those sorts of things can change. But between now and then, you're going to see a lot of legal wrangling and the lawyers and the number of different motions filed, but Hyun, you want to comment on this one that we recently filed?","Hyun Park - Senior Vice President & General Counsel","Sure. this past Monday we filed a motion based on statute of limitation, and our request was that seven counts out of 28 counts should be dismissed on statute of limitation grounds. And the seven counts all relate to record keeping. And the motion is publicly available, and if you'd like a copy, we'd happy to send that to you.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. But then I mean in terms of \u2013 is there any way of estimating what the impact would be if that position was taken, one-third of the request or maybe a little less would be taken away?","Hyun Park - Senior Vice President & General Counsel","So if we were to succeed, it's seven counts out of 28 counts that would be dismissed.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And the penalty, its $0.5 million per count.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. I got you. And then the second thing that I'd like to ask is, in the Safe Harbor disclosure, I saw a new bullet point, at least I don't remember seeing it before about the impact of the reductions in customer demand for electricity and natural gas have on the utility's ability to recover investments through rates and to earn its operating ROE et cetera. Is there any reason why that showed up this quarter? Is there anything you could point to that, why this is now an issue?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think that's a trend we've been seeing that electricity sales continue to be soft, particularly here in California we've been so successful with our energy efficiency programs. Of course now we're getting a large number of rooftop solar installations that are starting to get to be more than just trivial numbers, and we've got 175,000 of them. And as we look ahead, we don't see electricity growth getting back to our historic levels.","And what that means because here in California, of course in that we're fully decoupled, our costs stay the same to operate the grid, and the risk that we referred to here is that at some point you're going to be spreading those costs over a smaller number of kilowatt hours. I mean that's precisely why we're looking at pushing hard on the rates reform, we really need a 21st century rate design not a 19th century or 20th century. And we thought given all of those trends, it's appropriate to add that as a caveat, but there is no one thing that contributed to it.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So, it's just, still recognizing it, trying to get it recognized for some time, but like for whatever reason you guys decided to include it this time, correct?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean the various factors have been developing and we just decided it's probably appropriate to start including this.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And then finally, there is a bunch of legislative initiatives concerning CPUC forum, the administration of energy efficiency, you guys know that more than I do and I won't list them. But are there any \u2013 is there one or two bills that you think are particularly are of significance for investors that we should be perhaps paying more attention to or focusing on with respect to this or is there anything you'd like to comment on in terms of sort of the political environment that sort of, that's separate from you guys to a certain degree now at this point. It's not \u2013 it's migrated from San Bruno, et cetera, to other things. Just in general, I mean is there any legislative initiative or changes at the CPUC you think we should be thinking about?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I've learned in my four years not to predict what happens here in this horse race to the end of the legislative session. You can never tell exactly what's going to come out of it. But the one that we're really focused on is a bill called SB 350, which is focusing on the renewable portfolio standard issues.","And looking at whether we increase the renewable portfolio standard to 50%, we are very actively involved in those discussions. We're working with all of the legislative leaders to see what comes out of that. And that's one I think you could be taking a look at as having some impact. We are going to hit the 33% renewable standard by 2020. And we know we can go above that 33%. It's a matter of how fast we get there and also how much it would cost to get there. And we're actively involved in those discussions.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. But on the CPUC reform legislation or efforts thereof is there any thoughts about what 660 or 825 might or might not mean?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I wouldn't want to handicap any of them right now.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks so much.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar. You may proceed.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Research","Good morning. Thank you. On the transmission side, in the TO-16 in that settlement, is there anything in that settlement that would lead you to believe that it wouldn't be a rubberstamp type of approval from FERC anything debatable in there?","Steven E. Malnight - Senior Vice President-Regulatory Affairs, Pacific Gas & Electric Co.","This is Steve Malnight again from Regulatory Affairs. We feel it's a good settlement with multiple parties. We submitted that to FERC and we'll just have to see how FERC processes that but.","Hyun Park - Senior Vice President & General Counsel","I think we have good experience with FERC approving settlements.","Steven E. Malnight - Senior Vice President-Regulatory Affairs, Pacific Gas & Electric Co.","Yeah.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Research","Okay. And then just in general for TO17 and even perhaps TO16 amendment, what's the risk of an ROE cut like we've seen in some other transmission areas?","Kent M.

At this time I would like to introduce your host Ms. Janet Loduca of PG&E. Thank you, and enjoy your conference. You may proceed Ms. Loduca.","Janet C. Loduca - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Jackie, and thanks to those of you on the phone for joining us this morning. Before I turn it over to Tony Earley, I want to remind you that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results, which is based on assumptions, forecasts, expectations, and information currently available to management. Some of the important factors that could affect the company's actual financial results are described on the second page of today's slide deck. We also encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q that will be filed with the SEC later today and the discussion of risk factors that appears there and in the 2015 annual report.","With that, I'll hand it over to Tony.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you, Janet, and good morning everyone. I've got some opening remarks and then I'll turn it over to Jason to review our financial results for the quarter. We continue to believe that the three key focus areas shown on the slide three are the foundation for long-term operational and financial success. I'll also cover some of our near-term challenges later in my remarks, but I do want to touch on some of the fundamental drivers of growth, first.","So let me start with an update on how we're positioning ourselves for a clean energy economy and the growth that it will make possible. As you know California has some of the most ambitious greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals in the country and we're helping the state to achieve those goals. First, as we plan for a 50% renewable portfolio standard, we're building additional flexibility into our contracts to effectively respond to changing market conditions. We've also begun our second round of energy storage solicitations, targeting nearly 600 megawatts of storage by 2024 to help manage the intermittency of renewables.","In March, we reached a settlement with many of the parties engaged in our electric vehicle charging infrastructure proposal, which is critical to enable the levels of EV adoptions the state is targeting over the next decade. We're hopeful the Commission will approve this settlement later this summer. And finally, as the uses of our energy grid now grow and evolve, we continue to invest in new technologies and equipment to enable distributed energy resources and more actively engage with other stakeholders to shape future policies.","Turning to customer expectations, our recent JD Power survey results show that we've made significant progress with our gas and electric business customers, with the largest year-over-year increase in customer satisfaction in almost a decade. These results reflect concerted efforts to improve the customer experience through ongoing safety and reliability investments.","The El Ni\u00f1o storms this winter were good news and bad news. On the positive side, given all the precipitation we've had we expect hydro production this year to be closer to normal compared with just 50% of normal last year. However the increased storms also negatively impacted our electric reliability during the quarter. Nevertheless, we continue to show very strong emergency response performance on both the gas and electric sides of the business. And our teams are working to get our reliability back on track for the remainder of the year.","We also continue to focus on reducing the number of third-party dig-ins on our gas lines. As you know, third-party dig-ins pose a significant public safety risk and are completely preventable through the free 811 call before you dig service. The significant steps we've taken to raise public awareness on this issue were recently recognized by the Common Ground Alliance and our efforts have resulted in industry-leading performance.","In April, we announced that PG&E entered into an agreement with TransCanyon, LLC, a joint venture between subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway Energy and Pinnacle West. The agreement with TransCanyon allows us to jointly pursue competitive electric transmission projects throughout the California ISO footprint. We look forward to leveraging our collective experience and resources to explore future opportunities.","Last week, we had a development in the Butte Fire when CAL FIRE issued its investigation report. The CAL FIRE report concluded that the fire was caused by a tree coming into contact with one of our lines, consistent with what had been reported in the press earlier. First, let me say that our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the victims and communities who suffered losses as a result of that fire and all of the devastating fires across California last summer. We also want to thank CAL FIRE and other first responders, including our own, for their heroic efforts in responding to all of those fires.","We continue to believe that we have one of the best vegetation management programs in the industry and disagree with the report's conclusion that our practices fell short. To give you a sense of the magnitude of our program, every year our certified arborists and registered professional foresters monitor nearly 50 million trees across our service territory, and we remove more than a million trees each year. We use some of the most sophisticated technology that I've seen in my career for this program. Jason will review the financial impact of the Butte Fire in just a minute.","And finally, I want to provide a few regulatory and legal updates. I'll start with the 2015 Gas Transmission and Storage rate case, which I know is top of mind for many of us. Although we had hoped to receive a proposed decision in the first quarter of this year, we're still waiting for that to be issued. As Jason will discuss, our quarterly financial results will continue to be impacted until we receive a final decision. In the 2017 General Rate Case we were really gratified to receive a report from the Safety and Enforcement Division recognizing our risk management practices as industry-leading. The SED report found that PG&E's risk assessment approach provides a greater transparency, and successfully maps risk outcomes to requested expenditures, meeting the Commission's goal of moving safety to a fundamental consideration in the case.","The SED report also acknowledged that the value of the third-party certifications \u2013 they've acknowledged the value of the third-party certifications we've received in our gas asset management programs.","In April, we also received testimony from the other parties in the case, which recommended reductions to our request. Obviously, we disagree with those proposed reductions, and we'll be filing our response later this month.","In the gas distribution, record keeping investigation, we received penalty recommendations from both the Safety and Enforcement Division and the City of Carmel. Fundamentally, we do not believe that any of the penalties are warranted in the case. However our response noted that if the CPUC decides to issue a penalty, we believe it should not exceed $33.6 million, and should be applied towards future spending rather than taking the form of a fine. At this point, the record is complete, and we're awaiting a decision from the Commission.","I also want to provide a brief update on the criminal case. We continue to believe that the changes do not \u2013 the charges do not have any merit. While we have acknowledged that we've made mistakes in the past, we simply haven't seen any evidence to indicate that PG&E employees knowingly and willfully violated the law. We're anxious to get the case underway, but just two weeks before the trial was scheduled to begin, the government finally provided us with more than 100,000 pages of documents that we've been requesting for more than a year. To ensure we could thoroughly review all of this material, we were compelled to ask the court for a delay. We're scheduled to go back before the court tomorrow to provide an update on our review of the documents and we hope to get a reasonable new trial date at that time.","So to sum things up, while we continue to work through some of the outstanding regulatory and legal issues, we are well-positioned for growth, as we support California's clean energy future.","So with that, I'll hand it over to Jason to review the financials.","Jason P. Wells - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by covering the first quarter results and then quickly review the 2016 outlook. Slide five shows our results for the first quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $0.82. GAAP earnings, including the items impacting comparability are also shown here. The pre-tax numbers for the items impacting comparability are at the bottom of the page.","Pipeline related expenses came in at $22 million pre-tax in Q1. Our legal and regulatory related expenses were $17 million pre-tax for the quarter. And fines and penalties were $87 million pre-tax. As a reminder, this amount represents our estimate of the disallowed capital work, coming out of the final San Bruno penalty decision, which we are accruing as we complete the work.","Our results for the first quarter, include a new item impacting comparability for costs related to the Butte Fire. Based on the CAL FIRE report, we've taken a charge for $381 million pre-tax for the first quarter. As background, California has a theory of inverse condemnation, under which utilities may be liable for property damages without a finding of negligence when a power line is involved in a fire. The charge we've taken includes $350 million to reflect the low-end of a range for property damage and an additional $31 million for other costs related to the fire. At this point, we are not able to estimate the upper end of the range. We do carry liability insurance for claims like these, so we would expect to be able to recover a significant portion of those costs through insurance in the future.","And we would show the insurance recoveries, as an offsetting positive item impacting comparability, in the future periods, as they are recorded. Finally, it is important to note that the $381 million does not include an accrual for any fire suppression or personal injury damages, both of which would require a showing of negligence.","Slide six shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison from earnings from operations of $0.87 in Q1 last year and $0.82 in Q1 this year. The largest item, relates to the timing of taxes during the quarter, which was $0.08 negative. GAAP accounting requires us to smooth the impact of taxes across the quarters, even as income fluctuates. This is purely a timing item that will reverse by year-end.","In the first quarter of 2015, we completed our disposition of the SolarCity shares. We did not have that item this quarter, resulting in $0.03 negative. And issuing additional shares, also resulted in $0.03 negative. These negative drivers were partially offset by growth in rate-based earnings which was $0.05 positive for the quarter. This item reflects assets covered by our General Rate Case and our electric transmission TO rate case. It does not include the Gas Transmission rate case since we do not yet have a decision. At this point, we would not expect a final decision in the first phase of the case until at least mid-year.","So while the timing should not affect our annual earnings from operations in 2016, it will continue to have an impact on our cash flows in quarterly results as you saw last year. And finally, we had $0.04 of smaller positive miscellaneous items that impacted the quarter.","Today, we are reaffirming our guidance for earnings from operations of $3.65 per share to $3.85 per share, and that is shown on slide seven. The underlying assumptions for earnings from operations remain the same as what we provided last quarter, so I'll just quickly cover the highlights.","On slide eight, we continue to assume capital expenditures of roughly $5.6 billion, and a weighted average authorized rate base of about $32.6 billion for the year. On the bottom right, I want to reiterate a key assumption to our guidance, which is that we receive a reasonable outcome in the Gas Transmission rate case this year.","Turning to slide nine, the guidance for the items impacting comparability has been updated to include the Butte Fire related costs. The other items impacting comparability are unchanged from last quarter. Our guidance for the year for the Butte Fire related cost reflects the Q1 charge of $381 million, which is the low end of the range for property damages, plus some other fire related costs. As I mentioned, we are not able to estimate the high end of the range at this time.","As shown at the bottom of the slide, the current range for items impacting comparability in 2016 is right about $1 billion. And as a reminder, this range excludes any potential future fines or penalties beyond our estimates of the disallowed capital and expense costs associated with the San Bruno Penalty.","On slide 10, we continue to assume equity issuance of $600 million to $800 million in 2016. During the first quarter, we issued about $150 million in equity through our internal and dribble programs. As a reminder the range reflects a number of assumptions including the timing and the amount of revenues we receive in the Gas Transmission rate case. The charge for the Butte fire results in roughly $100 million in new equity needs this year, which puts us towards the high end of our range.","And finally, on slides 11 and 12, we are reaffirming the CapEx and rate base ranges through 2019. So to conclude, we continue to have a strong growth profile supported by California's long term policy objectives. We are confident in our ability to execute on our operational plans as we continue to work through outstanding regulatory and legal issues.","With that, let's open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Stephen.","Jason P. Wells - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I wanted to dig into the status of the efforts underway to create and integrate the Western grid. We obviously follow with interest your joint venture, but more broadly, it seems like there's a lot underway in terms of trying to move towards that overall goal and we've been trying to follow the procedural steps there. But at a high level, can you give us a sense of where that's headed, is there any contentious issues or what any sticking points in terms of trying to move forward towards the concept of a more integrated Western grid?","Geisha J. Williams - President, Electric, PG&E Corp.","Hi, Stephen. This is Geisha Williams. We are very supportive of the energy imbalance market and also CAISO's efforts to really have a more regional larger footprint. There is a lot of discussion going on, good progress has been made already with the EIM or the energy imbalance market and a lot of discussions are occurring right now in terms of looking at beyond the energy imbalance market, what it would take actually have a broader market, a broader area. We support it for lots of reasons, not the least of which is we believe that it will enable CAISO to really dispatch lower cost renewables, really take advantage of the load diversity and supply diversity that really is in existence in the western area. So we're optimistic and very supportive of their efforts.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. And can you share any particular elements of push back or any sort of \u2013 it seems like there are a number of benefits to having a more integrated grid. Are there any sort of negatives or issues that have been raised that, that could potentially be sticking points?","Geisha J. Williams - President, Electric, PG&E Corp.","I think that there could be \u2013 one of the issues is, who governs this broad regional area. Right now, the CAISO is really focused on California. So the membership of the board is are Californians appointed by the Governor of California. As we look at a broader market, it will be interesting to see what the makeup of that board would be, what the representation will be from other states and what the implications might therefore be on California. One of the things that will create a bit of a sticking point will be that the rates of California will not be increased, as a result of a broader market. So these are going to be some of the issues that are going to have to be resolved.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's helpful. And if I could shift gears quickly to energy storage. You've taken a lot of proactive steps in building that out. The one sort of item of feedback we get is that, obviously as costs drop, volumes in terms of installation could go up. At a high level, could you speak to \u2013 so what you think will be necessary to have an even broader deployment of storage, are there sort of mile post levels in terms of overall costs that you would see or is this more just a gradual adoption kind of a plan in the state?","Geisha J. Williams - President, Electric, PG&E Corp.","Well. California again is leading in this area and I think of course you know about the RFO on storage, the storage mandate that we have in place where PG&E will be putting in place 580 megawatts of storage between now and 2024. We had our first solicitation in December of 2014. We announced who the winners of that solicitation were. This year and now we're awaiting approval. We're going to have yet another solicitation at the end of this year for an additional 120 megawatts. So we're seeing great participation from the storage market, which is very \u2013 it's very good news. We think that it's an emerging technology, a lot of investment from many, many different companies around the world and we're hopeful that just as we saw declining prices on distributed generation or solar panels that we will similarly see improved costs if you will on the storage side. But it's early days and I think the market is still evolving and we're watching it and hopeful that again as more and more storage comes online that in fact we will see better pricing in the future.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. And if you did see significant cost reductions in storage, could there be a step change upward in terms of the amount of storage that you would ideally want to employ?","Geisha J. Williams - President, Electric, PG&E Corp.","Well we believe storage is really a critical part of integrating renewables. So we are very active in the market looking at our own ownership as well as contracting with third-parties. But again, it depends on the economics, it depends on what types of changes we see in the future. Again we're hopeful, and are always in discussions with folks about what could potentially work. But again it's like looking in the crystal ball. I really can't \u2013 I can't really speculate on what prices might be and what our actions might be in relation to those prices.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Byrd. Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Good morning.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning Greg.","Jason P. Wells - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","I know you've articulated that it's your aspiration to take some action on the dividend and give investors, a sort of a vision for what you see as the long-term, sort of total return profile for the investment after we get through these last few milestones. Is it fair for me, or am I putting words in your mouth to say that the GT&S case, and the criminal proceeding are sort of the last two major issues we need to resolve before you feel comfortable articulating that outlook?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Greg, first of all, we have made good progress internally on our discussions about the dividend. I feel good about it. Recall at the last quarterly earnings report, I said it's my objective to be able to publicly state our policy this year. Obviously we've got to be sensitive to all the other things that are going on. So I wouldn't call the things you mentioned as things that have to get behind us. But they have to be in the right place in order to make a decision, I mean I would tell you the Butte fire, we're just in the early stages of analyzing what the impacts are and we've got to just figure that out. I don't see that it will in the long run impact our ability at all for a dividend, but you just have to be sensitive. You've got to make sure, you've got all those things lined up when you make that announcement.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks. And on the Butte fire, I know you've increased your assumed equity issuance needs within the guidance range of course as a function of that. But if you ultimately are covered by your insurance policies, is it actually necessary to equitize those, really necessary to equitize those costs.","Jason P. Wells - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hi, Greg. It's Jason Wells. No, over the long-term, it wouldn't be. But there may be a timing difference between the recognition for the costs associated with the Butte fire and the receipt of the insurance proceeds. So over the long term, no, there would not be the need to equitize those amounts, but there may be short-term financing need.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Gordon. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Just a follow up on that topic. So would it be fair to say that it's still, dividends is still something that could be addressed in 2016?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's my goal.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then a question on the criminal case, you mentioned the document dump and that you'll be kind of responding tomorrow, I think to the court. Just curious if you could, maybe we can get this tomorrow, but were there a lot of documents in there that kind of would you say better support your case, and obviously better kind of \u2013 it sounds like it supports your comment that you already made that there is no evidence of any purposeful negligence.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Just a couple of comments. One, the fact we have 100,000 pages of documents dumped on us two weeks before the trial is quite remarkable. The hearing tomorrow is just to report on going through those documents. You have to go through them \u2013 someone's got to read all the documents. They are not in a \u2013 they weren't given to us in a form that you could do any automated reading of them. So somebody has got to put eyeballs on them. It takes a while to do that. And yes, we are finding documents that are very helpful to our case.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. And then I think just on the Butte Fire issue. So could you may be just go through once again the different areas of potential exposures that we need to think about. You mentioned you've taken this reserve for property damage. But then I guess what are the other areas that are not estimable that you haven't reserved and how we should think about those.","Jason P. Wells - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, this is Jason. We're still in the early stages of discovery and getting more information on the specific claims. With respect to the property damage though, I would say we have a good handle on the damages related to structures. But some of the other components are more complicated including damages to trees. As you can imagine, there are a lot of variables that go in to quantifying damages related to tree loss, including the number of trees that were burned over the 70,000 acres, the species and size of those trees, the pre-fire health of the trees, the post-fire tree value among other factors. And so we're working through these issues and we'll obviously provide an updated estimate once we have better information and are able to access those impacted parties. So that's what I would focus on from a property damage standpoint.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Fleishman. Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Hate to beat the dead horse but on the wildfire issue, you mentioned the $350 million was the low end, what's the high end?","Jason P. Wells - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We don't have a high end of the range at this point. We're still \u2013 it's \u2013 we're really in the early stages. So we're trying to gather as much information as we can on the specific claims, and we'll obviously update that range when we have better information.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. So it's not a \u2013 not really a range if there's not a high end. I'm just trying to think about, is there something we're going to be talking about every quarter, where the number keeps creeping up or is this, hey, we've kind of done the bulk of the work, we're 90% of the way there and maybe there is a little bit more coming, but it's not a material bit more.","Jason P. Wells - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think we're really in the early stage. As I mentioned before, I think we have a really good handle on the damages related to structures. There is still a lot more work that we need to do particularly related to the damages to trees. And so we're working through that as quickly as possible.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And Tony, as you get through the GT&S case, as you get through the final San Bruno related stuff, how are you thinking longer-term, meaning 2017 and beyond, about the ability to earn the authorized and some of the tailwinds or headwinds that could actually enable you to do so, or keep you from doing so?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, obviously, that's our objective is to earn our allowed return going forward. And we think we've done a lot of work, both internally on managing our cost. We've got a big push on affordability here. Obviously, we're going to invest what we think we need to invest in the system and I think given the approach in rate cases, we're very optimistic that the showings we've made in our rate cases will support getting a level of revenues, that means that we will have money to continue to make those investments. So there're obviously going to be things that come up, but I think, we're positioning ourselves well for the future.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And when you think about the main GRC, the generation and distribution one, how are you thinking about the timeline for that? I know what the stated timeline is. Unfortunately California hasn't stuck to a stated timeline on a rate case for anybody in the state for a number of years and how any significant delays could potentially impact the balance sheet or cash flows?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, just in general, you're right. It's not just us. All of the cases have been delayed recently. We've had discussions about that. That's not helping California's image, I mean from a regulatory standpoint we've got lots of good policies in place. But the policies aren't effective unless you get the decisions based on them. That said, I really do think this case is different. I mentioned some other things that SED said about our filing. And also when you look at the bid-ask range, it's not as big as it's been in the past. And so we hope this can be moved along faster than in the past. And maybe I'll let Steve Malnight comment.","Steven E. Malnight - Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs, PG&E Corp.","Yeah, this is Steve. Thank you, Tony. I do think a couple of things. I agree with Tony. The case so far is moving along on schedule. I think we're optimistic about the case. The challenges do tend to come later in terms of timing. However, having said that, in this case we also did already receive the authorization to ensure that if the case is delayed, the revenues would be retroactive to the beginning of 2017, which is an important milestone that the Commission has regularly done in many of these cases. So the timing impact is somewhat muted because of that benefit.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks, guys. Much appreciated.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Lapides. Our next question comes from Chris Turnure with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning guys. I know we've gone over this on past calls, but I wanted to just discuss the rate base and CapEx guidance for both this year and the next couple of years. Is there a chance that there could be lower CapEx spend than the bottom end of the range, if all of your rate case decisions kind of come out at the lowest, I guess potential scenario that you guys have been anticipating.","Jason P. Wells - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I'd say it's really, really early to kind of presuppose any decision on this process. Just as a reminder, our CapEx and rate base ranges, what we provided here is essentially in the outer years, we stayed flat to what we were spending in 2015, which I think is a reasonable assumption for the low-end of the range. And then the upper-end of the range reflects what we currently filed in our rate cases and where there's a period not covered by the rate case, we hold that upper range flat with the last rate case filing. So I do think it represents a reasonable range for CapEx and rate base over the next several years.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And I guess, the other thing that I would add. Some of the recommendations of the other parties while they recommended reductions in our expenses largely supported the capital proposals.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just to go back to the fire. Maybe you could give us a bit of historical context here and remind us of your last kind of major fire where you had a liability there, and how things kind of played out in terms of timing, the amount of liability and the insurance proceeds. And then am I to understand this, the special legal clause in the State of California as basically putting any utility on the hook to pay for trees and other property damage even if they are not negligent there. It seems kind of a lot there and obviously you have insurance proceeds. Do those costs of insurance and the premiums there get passed through to rate payers ultimately?","Hyun Park - Senior Vice President & General Counsel","So, this is Hyun Park, General Counsel. So you had a number of questions there. So I'll try to answer what I can recall. The first question was about our prior experience with fires. And yeah, we've had fires in the past, and for example in 2013, we settled two fires; 2004 Power Fire and 2008 Whiskey fire and it cost us $50.5 million to settle those fire cases. In 2012, we spent approximately $30 million settling the 2004 Fred's and Sims Fires and in 2009, we spent approximately $15 million to settle the 1999 Pendola Fire. So those are the recent experiences with the fire cases.","And you asked a question I think about inverse condemnation. And basically, inverse condemnation is a doctrine that is based on the California Constitution. It's based on the Takings Clause of the California Constitution. And courts basically held that inverse condemnation maybe found when three elements are satisfied. First, there has to be injury to private property. And second, the property damage was substantially caused. So there has to be a substantial causation and it does not matter whether there is fault or not.","And thirdly, the damage had to be caused by a public improvement operating as deliberately designed, constructed or maintained. So that's the language from the case law. And inverse condemnation has been applied to utility fire cases, where fires were caused by power lines, and court cases that basically describe the underlying purpose of this doctrine is intending to distribute throughout the community, any loss inflicted upon an individual property owner by public improvement. And inverse condemnation allows recovery for property damage, prejudgment interest and attorney's fees.","Jason P. Wells - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks. And I think you had one question about recoverability of our insurance costs. They are a component of our rate cases. So we do file and seek recovery for the costs of our various insurance programs.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you Mr. Turnure. Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. I just want to follow up on the previous questions. What's the path from here to reconcile the Butte fire. Do we \u2013 you guys go through the paperwork. You come up with a new target. Does it go to a court, does it go to District Court or where does it get resolved?","Hyun Park - Senior Vice President & General Counsel","Yeah. So to-date we have 32 complaints involving approximately 1,300 plaintiffs and their property insurers. So these cases have been coordinated in Sacramento Superior Court and of course it's possible that more cases will be filed. And right now, what's happening is the plaintiffs are starting to present to the utility claims seeking early resolution of the so-called preference cases and these are the cases that involve plaintiffs who either due to their age or physical condition are not able to wait for the full trial process. So we're starting to engage in discussions with the plaintiff's counsel about that these preference cases. And we have a Case Management Conference in Sacramento Superior Court on May 24.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","When you went to the previous question, it seemed that from fires to settlement, we were looking at anywhere from eight years to 10 years, is that accurate or did I not hear it correctly?","Hyun Park - Senior Vice President & General Counsel","I don't recall, saying anything about eight years to 10 years, but....","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","When you mentioned the fires, there were 2004 fires that were settled in the last couple of eyars.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Is that accurate?","Hyun Park - Senior Vice President & General Counsel","Yeah. So some of these settlements do to take a while. Yeah.","Geisha J. Williams - President, Electric, PG&E Corp.","I think the components of the settlements that normally takes the longest is the actual CAL FIRE or U.S. Forestry Service component where they are asking or claiming fire suppressions costs and it's that element that likely often takes a long time.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And just lastly, Jason, just trying to sure I heard correctly, the fine recommended by CAL FIRE was $90 million but that's not included in the company's low end of the range right now, is that correct?","Jason P. Wells - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, couple of things on that. The first is the $90 million that CAL FIRE mentioned in its report was not a fine. It was essentially, they're seeking recovery for their cost to respond to the fire. In order for us to be viable for those fire suppression costs that were incurred by CAL FIRE, we'd have to be found liable for negligence and we just don't see, see that as based on what we understand today that we don't see the possibility being found liable for negligence as Geisha mentioned and as Tony mentioned. We have an industry-leading veg management program. And so at this point, we have not accrued anything for those fire suppression costs.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Crowdell. Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning, guys.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Jason P. Wells - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I wanted to follow up on Steve's question regarding the criminal case. There has been some discussion about some of the former executives getting granted immunity. And I don't believe what that actually means or practically, or what does that mean, how should we think about that in terms of \u2013 what are the ramifications of that, I just don't understand it that well, do you follow what I'm saying?","Hyun Park - Senior Vice President & General Counsel","Yeah. So this is Hyun Park, again. So at the earlier stages of the government's investigation of this case, the government insisted that certain of our current or former employee witnesses be represented by a separate counsel, other than the company counsel and in situations like the one we're in, getting immunity by certain witnesses is actually fairly common and I don't think one should read too much into that.","As part of our cooperation with the government, we agreed to have some of our employee witnesses be represented by separate counsel. And these witnesses' lawyers negotiated an immunity, and it's fairly routine. And just being granted immunity does not mean that they are going to testify for or against anybody. I mean the bottom-line is that they all have to be sworn in to tell the truth.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","This is Tony, I might add that in the civil cases, because remember we have the investigation into San Bruno. But in the civil cases most of these employees were deposed. So we have a pretty good idea of what they're going to say and that's why we continue to believe that there is no basis for saying that anyone knowingly and willfully violated the law.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So it's fairly routine. I guess just lawyers probably protecting their clients, would it be safe to say in terms of any potential charges being brought up. Just to make them more comfortable in terms of what they are able to discuss. Is that how we should think about what it sort of procedurally mean as opposed to them necessarily cooperating with the government to...","Hyun Park - Senior Vice President & General Counsel","Yeah, as I said, I just don't think you can read too much into this, and it's pretty standard practice on the part of a defense counsel to try to negotiate an immunity for their clients.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Great. And the immunity is only for the issues that are involved in this case, is that correct? You know that or...","Hyun Park - Senior Vice President & General Counsel","I don't. I haven't seen these immunity agreements. So I really can't speak to that directly.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, fair enough. The rest of my questions have been answered. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Patterson. Our next question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please proceed.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi guys. So my question firstly is on the growth side, the 5% to 7% growth. I know there are utilities who worry about retail rates and is that a concern for you guys at all as in consistently growing at that level, do you see ever rate pressure coming that may restrict or limit the growth going forward?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll start off, this is Tony. Obviously, affordability is one of the things that we focus on here. One of the \u2013 the good news things here in California is well, some people say your rates are high. Actually the total customer bill is below the national average. And so while we're always sensitive, we still think that our products are overall affordable for the customer. Now one of California's challenges is in the rate structure that's been in place for a long time really needs to be reformed, because there are some groups of customers that are paying far more than they should and others probably paying less, and we've made some progress in improving that. We need to continue to make further progress on it.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got you. Great. Thanks. And then, secondly just quickly on M&A and strategic direction both on the buy and sell side. Is there any view from your perspective on how you look at the landscape today given the consolidation that's happened in the space. How are you looking at the strategic path going forward, I guess?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So obviously, we never comment on specifics of M&A. But just stepping back from an industry standpoint, I believe we'll continue to see a fairly slow consolidation of the industry. It kind of goes in fits and starts. One of the interesting things is the consolidations \u2013 recently, the big consolidations have been creating combination companies. So gas and electric combined. Of course we're already there. We're a combination company.","Also California is different, in many parts of the country, gas is viewed as the transition fuel from an environmental standpoint replacing coal. We have no coal on our system in California. So it's \u2013 the long-term issues are a little bit different here in California.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got you. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Mehta. Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good morning.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Jason P. Wells - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","So a lot's been asked and answered already, but just following up here. First, just on the equity side of the equation. Obviously, Butte fire is not necessarily explicitly reflected. How do you think about equity needs 2016 and more importantly onwards, right, but you've laid out rate base, you've laid out CapEx, is there any good way to think about that generically?","Jason P. Wells - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. What I continue to focus on is sort of the two big drivers of our capital needs, which are our CapEx program and our unrecovered costs. For our CapEx guidance, we've provided a range that relates to our pending rate cases. I think there you have to make an assumption what are we going to receive in those rate cases and what our CapEx will be to inform equity needs related to CapEx.","On the other side of unrecovered costs, what I'll say is we expect to fully fund the San Bruno penalty in 2016. So that will go away after 2016 as a driver of equity needs. We also have our Right of Way program in our gas transmission business, which will continue through 2017. And as a quick reminder, that was a $500 million program to be completed over five years ending in 2017. So that will continue into 2017. And then you'll have to make your assumptions around any additional unrecovered costs, but absent any new items, unrecovered costs should start to decrease in 2017 and 2018 and be much less of a driver of the ongoing equity needs for the business.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. And then just continuing there. Since you left it off at the GT&S. So maybe curious, can you elaborate a little bit more, I know it's been out there for a bit, what the rate impacts are by customer class and perhaps if you can comment to what extent is that any potential limiting factor and getting resolution here versus just the conventional lag that we've seen before the CPUC and getting cases processed.","Steven E. Malnight - Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs, PG&E Corp.","Hi, this is Steve Malnight. Well, I think that obviously this is a big case and it's been going on for some time. The rate impacts when you look at our original proposal, the rate impacts would be a monthly increase of about $5 a month or 12% for our customers. That is an issue. I think that is in consideration and was a part of the discussion throughout this case, but more so it's really about what's the right work that needs to be done in the system and the right cost to do that. And I think in this case we've seen a substantial record built on why we believe that the work we proposed is the right work to get done. So, we'll just have to see how that comes out in the proposed decision.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And last quick one, TransCanyon, why the latest partnership, why now perhaps if I would ask after years of success alone?","Geisha J. Williams - President, Electric, PG&E Corp.","Hi, Julien, this is Geisha. So, we've been very successful within California in terms of competitive projects. But as we look at a broader market, we've talked about it earlier, broader CAISO footprint. And we think an alliance agreement with TransCanyon makes sense. We think we have strengths. They have strengths. And together, we can even be more competitive and successful.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Smith.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to introduce your host, Gabe Togneri, with PG&E. Thank you and enjoy your call. You may proceed, Mr. Togneri.","Gabriel B. Togneri","Thanks, Monique. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us on our call. Before you hear from Tony Earley, Chris Johns and Kent Harvey, let me remind you that our discussion will include forward-looking statements based on assumptions and expectations reflecting information currently available to management. Some of the important factors that could affect the company's results are described in Exhibit 1, located in the appendix of today's slides. And we encourage you to review the discussion of risk factors that appears in the 2011 Annual Report and in the Form 10-Q that we'll file with the SEC later today.","And with that, I'll hand it over to Tony.","Anthony F. Earley","Thanks, Gabe, and good morning, everyone. Before I start, I know many of you are on the east coast and I want to urge you to make sure that you're in a safe location, and please don't try and travel until the storm passes and we -- you know the extent of it. EEI has activated its storm response network. The industry is mobilizing all possible resources, including west coast resources. PG&E is looking at what we can do to help, along with the other west coast utilities. This could be a very major event. So please make sure you are careful and stay safe.","My comments this morning will be brief, and then I'll turn it over to Chris and Kent. On Slide 2, as you've seen before, our focus is on 3 priorities: resolving the gas issues, positioning the company for long-term success and rebuilding relationships. I'm pleased to report we continue to make progress in these areas, including improvements throughout all of our operations, and we continue to be focused on the key stakeholders, especially customers.","Given recent events, however, our call today will primarily cover gas issues, starting with our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan. We're disappointed with the proposed decision we received on the PSEP filing because, among other things, it failed to reflect the fact that much of this work is driven by new standards and requirements and that good engineering and planning practices include contingency plans in such complex operations, and Chris is going to elaborate more on this point.","As it stands, the proposed decision is punitive and, with cost already incurred, represents more than $1 billion in unrecovered costs, without even factoring how the investigations will be resolved. We believe that the resolution of the investigations and the resolution of the PSEP rulemaking should be viewed in conjunction with each other to resolve in an appropriate conclusion. This is going to be the primary focus as we participate in continuing settlement discussions.","I want to emphasize, we are still committed to the settlement discussions, and we still believe in the involvement -- that the involvement of a mediator is the best way to bring the parties together in what have been complex and protracted discussions. As always, our work to resolve the gas proceedings will not distract us from our obligation to deliver safe, reliable and affordable gas and electric service to our customers.","So with that, let me turn it over to Chris to go into some of these things in detail.","Christopher P. Johns","Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. As you can see on Slide 3, my comments will primarily be focused on the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Program, or the PSEP program, and the proposed decision and the work that we outlined in our PSEP filing. I'll also provide an update on Hinkley, the environmental activities there.","You'll recall that the PSEP filing was made in August of 2011 and represents the work that we believe is necessary to address the new higher standards adopted by the CPUC related to pipeline safety and modernization. We made our filing in about 2 months' time in response to the CPUC directive to develop a comprehensive multiyear plan.","In developing the PSEP cost estimates, we worked with an industry expert who followed industry best practices in helping us estimate these costs. In particular, our contingency estimates followed project management standards for work in the preliminary design stage, as much of our work was at that time. We also requested an advice letter process for recovery of costs of both those estimates. Since making our filing, our experience in the field shows that we need the contingency and, in some cases, more than that, as I'll describe in a moment.","In contrast, the proposed decision in the PSEP orders us to complete the work we outlined but disallows a significant portion of the funding, including all of the requested contingency and the advice letter mechanism. We believe the rejection of these requests is both arbitrary and unreasonable, particularly since this is an established practice used in other commission proceedings. The proposed decision also drastically reduces our return on equity on PSEP capital investment, compounding the punitive effect of the decision.","Shifting to the work underway, we are on track to accomplish the work we targeted for this year. On the strength test front, we completed 85 miles of testing in the third quarter, putting us on track to achieve the 160 miles we targeted by year end. Our PSEP filing targets more than 350 additional miles through 2014.","As Nick Stavropoulos discussed on our call in February, we've seen strength test costs that are higher than both industry benchmarks and the cost assumptions in our PSEP filing. The strength testing effort is the largest and most expansive -- expensive component of the planned PSEP expenses. We did achieve a 25% cost reduction in 2012 compared to our per-mile cost in 2011, but we expect the strength testing in 2013 and '14 to be at a similar unit cost as it is in '12.","There are a couple of drivers for these higher costs. First, we're testing short segments of older pipeline as opposed to newly constructed longer segments. These are often located in dense, urban areas as opposed to the rural, less populated areas. Second, when we prepared our cost forecast, we assumed that the pipelines could be cleaned with a single cleaning run. However, in practice, fully eliminating the contaminants in the older lines has required up to 5 cleaning runs, significantly increasing the cost of storing, testing, treating, transporting and disposing of the water used in the cleaning runs.","On the pipeline replacement, we completed the replacement of 12 miles in the third quarter. We have additional replacement projects currently underway, and we expect to have replaced almost 40 miles by year end. We plan to replace an additional 150 miles through 2014 as outlined in our filing. Conditions we've encountered while completing this work include more complicated and lengthy permitting processes, as well as land acquisition delays and project reengineering. The pipeline replacement cost is expected to be at a level consistent with our request when you include the contingencies in 2013 and 2014.","In our work validating the Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure, or the MAOP, our pipeline -- of our pipelines, we've completed the validation of more than 3,000 miles year-to-date with 4,000 miles expected to be validated by the end of the year. We're on track to complete all of the MAOP validation work of our entire gas transmission network of more than 6,700 miles by early 2013. We've also installed 35 automated valves so far this year and expect to reach our target of 46 by year end. The costs associated with these programs are in line with what we assumed in the PSEP filing when including the contingency.","So summing this up, we continue to focus on ways to complete all of our work more efficiently, including competitive bidding and more pre-engineering and design work. It's a reasonable assumption, though, at this point that we will need more than the contingency amounts requested in the PSEP filing for the expense-related work and to meet our commitments and that we will remain on track, including the contingency, for the capital-related work.","Now before I conclude, I'll briefly mention our chromium cleanup of the groundwater in Hinkley. To remind you, earlier this year, we established a program that offered eligible residents a set of alternatives, including a whole house water replacement system or the choice to sell us their property. We have adjusted our cost estimates for Hinkley to reflect the responses we've received. We have also made adjustments based on the draft environmental impact report issued by the water board in August. As a result of these items, we took an additional charge of $24 million this quarter. We believe that we've developed a strong, final remediation plan, and our accruals have been based on that plan. However, the water board is not anticipated to adopt the final plan until sometime in 2013.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Kent.","Kent M. Harvey","Thanks, Chris, and good morning. As usual, I'll run through our third quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. As you'll see, the quarter was in line with our expectations. I'll also address some of the financial implications of the proposed decision on our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan should it be adopted in its current form.","Slide 4 summarizes our results for the quarter. Earnings from operations were $0.93 per diluted common share while GAAP results were $0.84. The difference is the items impacting comparability for natural gas matters and for environmental-related costs.","The components of the item impacting comparability for gas matters are shown in the table at the bottom in pretax dollars. Pipeline-related costs totaled $139 million during the quarter, including work in the field and legal costs. There were no additional accruals for third-party liability claims during the quarter, but we did book insurance recovery of $99 million in Q3. That brings total insurance recovery since the accident to $234 million.","In terms of the item impacting comparability for environmental-related costs, we accrued an additional charge of about $0.03 per share in Q3, reflecting the development at Hinkley that Chris described.","Slide 5 shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison from earnings from operations, including the primary factors that take us from $1.08 in Q3 last year to $0.93 in Q3 this year. While we had a $0.05 increase in rate base earnings compared to a year ago, this was more than offset by our planned incremental work across the utility, which totaled $0.10 negative during the quarter, and share dilution, which totaled $0.06. In addition, we had other smaller items that net to a negative $0.04.","Slide 6 summarizes our 2012 guidance. The changes from last quarter are shown in blue. Our range for earnings from operations is unchanged at $3.10 to $3.30 per share. Our range for the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters has been updated solely to reflect the insurance recovery booked in Q3.","The table at the bottom provides the ranges for each component of the natural gas matters in pretax dollars, and I'll just briefly go through them. For pipeline-related costs, the range remains $450 million to $550 million for the year, and we continue to trend towards the upper end.","I need to point out that the proposed decision for the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan, if adopted by the PUC, would result in the write-off of some capital expenditures we've made since the program began. That effect is not included in our guidance at this point, and I'll say more about that a little later on.","The third party liability claims, our range for 2012 was unchanged at $80 million to $225 million. The larger number corresponds to the upper estimate for cumulative third-party liabilities, which remains at $600 million. For insurance recoveries, you see the $135 million we booked during the first 3 quarters of the year. And has been our practice, we're not providing guidance for future insurance recoveries or for additional penalties beyond what we've already accrued.","Back to the table at the top, we've updated the range for environmental-related costs to reflect the accrual taken in Q3. To date, we've accrued $0.13, consistent with our guidance of up to $0.14.","In terms of equity issuance, our year-to-date total to September was $720 million. We expect some modest additional issuance for the remainder of the year through our 401(k) and dividend reinvestment plans.","On our last call, I talked about our financial profile over the next few years. And Slide 7, which we used on the last call, lays out some of the drivers of this profile, including our requested CapEx and rate base, our allowed ROE, our incremental spend across the utility and then our equity needs.","And I'll remind you a few of the takeaways. We expect 2013 to be a down year for earnings from operations, primarily due to year-over-year dilution, some reduction in our authorized ROE and our incremental spend across the utility. 2014, on the other hand, is the start of our next General Rate Case period, and there's an opportunity to true-up our cost and revenues for significant portions of our operations and to continue to invest in our infrastructure.","Of course, this picture is clouded by the uncertainty associated with the gas pipeline issues, what the total cost will be and how the ratemaking is going to work. We hope to resolve these issues as soon as we can through the settlement process. In the meantime, the proposed decision on the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan provides the data points regarding some of the issues. Obviously, there is much about the PD we don't agree with, but I know many of you have been trying to assess the financial implication in the event it is approved by the commission.","Now Slide 8 is also from our last call, and I just want to spend a minute on it for context before we get into the proposed decision. So let me reorient you to the slide. At the top, you can see our 2012 guidance for pipeline-related costs totaling $450 million to $550 million, and this is comprised of the 4 components shown below that. These same components will affect 2013 and 2014 costs to varying degrees.","First, the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan expenses, which we may not recover. Second, the PSEP costs we're not requesting recovery of, such as certain work on post-1960 pipe, and we show those costs as declining after this year. Third, the other work that's been identified this year, including the rights of way work we described on our last call. We show these costs as increasing after this year. And I'll just say we're still in the process of scoping out this work, how long it's going to take and what it will cost, but we do expect the work to be significant. And then fourth are the legal and other costs, which we show as declining after this year.","Now it's that first component, the PSEP cost, that's really addressed in the proposed decision. As Chris said, the PD orders us to do the work but would disallow recovery of a significant portion of those costs, including all the requested contingency amount and the advice letter mechanism to address costs above those levels.","So let's go to Slide 9 which shows you the numbers from the proposed decision. The top half of the slide compares our requested expense recovery each year with the amounts recommended for recovery in the proposed decision, and then the bottom half does the same thing for capital.","So I'll start with expense. Assuming we don't receive a final decision until the beginning of 2013, the PD would disallow all 2012 expenses. That's in line with our guidance that we've been providing for this year. For 2013 and 2014, the PD will leave us short for expense work by about $130 million over the 2-year period compared to our original request, which included the contingency. So that's the $81 million and the $51 million from the slide. However, as Chris indicated, our experience to date with pressure testing is that our costs will be higher than our original request. That means our unrecovered expenses in 2013 and 2014 could be roughly double the amount shown here.","Now let's go to capital. The proposed decision would disallow recovery of about $400 million of capital expenditures over the 4-year period, including the entirety of our records project and all the contingency we requested. If the proposed decision were approved by the PUC, we'd have to write off the disallowed capital. For capital that's already been incurred, we'd take an immediate charge. And then for future capital that exceeds the authorized level, we'd write that off as it's incurred. To date, we've had less experience with capital work than with our expense. But our experience so far suggests that our costs are generally on track with the amounts we requested, if you include the contingency. So long as that trend continues, the amount shown here will approximate our unrecovered capital cost over this period.","Now going forward, I expect this to continue to show any unrecovered PSEP costs, both expense and capital, along with other gas pipeline-related costs from the prior slide, as an item impacting comparability in 2013 and 2014. For those PSEP investments we are allowed to recover, the proposed decision would also reduce the return on equity to the level of our embedded cost of debt. They continue to earn this reduced return for a 5-year period after each project's gone into operation. After that, they'd be allowed to earn our authorized cost of equity.","We estimate that the total nominal value of this reduced return could be roughly $130 million after tax over the relevant period, and that figure is shown at the bottom of the table. If the PD is approved as proposed, I'd expect us to reflect the lower return in our earnings from operations going forward rather than include it in an item impacting comparability, since earnings on rate base is typically viewed as ongoing.","So that basically covers the potential impact of the PSEP proposed decision, including the unrecovered expenses, the CapEx and the reduced return on equity. I'm going to turn it back to Tony now for a few final comments.","Anthony F. Earley","So let me reiterate a few points before we go to the Q&A. I want to assure you, we are totally committed to resolving the outstanding regulatory issues, the 3 investigations and the rulemaking associated with our Gas Transmission business.","We believe it's in everyone's best interest to reach a conclusion as soon as possible and move forward with the important work to improve the system that we've already begun without the ongoing hearings, briefings and other activities that divert resources from the primary task at hand. If we can't settle these proceedings in a global way, it will be months before we get a final decision in all of them, and I know that's frustrating to you. But I still believe the commissioners know that we're working on the right things and that we need to be financially sound to complete that work successfully.","So with that, let's move to the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just curious, when you put out the 8-K after the proposed decision on the PSEP came out, one data point was in there caught our eye that -- I think it had said that you had spent $95 million of capital in total on the PSEP. And if I look at, I think it was Kent's Slide 9, your proposed capital spending combined for 2011 and 2012, that's $69 million and $384 million, so closer to $454 million, $60 million or so. Just curious, are you -- after third quarter, are you still vastly underspending the proposed capital tied to the PSEP?","Kent M. Harvey","Michael, this is Kent. Yes, the cumulative CapEx for -- under the PSEP program through the end of Q3 was $187 million CapEx. So that number's been updated. You're right. Our original plan shown on Slide 9 here would approach $450 million, and we may not get there completely by year end. But we are going to have a significantly higher number than the $187 million by the end of year. Whatever the number, a significant portion would be written off if the PD were approved. Obviously, we're still kind of working through the details of the PD.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. But this isn't -- this is a timing issue. This isn't a, \"Hey, you're finding ways to spend capital at a cost lower than what you had filed originally when you made this application.\"","Kent M. Harvey","Michael, that's right. It is a timing issue, and the work was more tilted towards the latter half of the year rather than early in the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Two questions. One is can you -- I don't think you've shared sort of what the rate base would look like under the PSEP PD. Is that something you can give us some guidance on?","Kent M. Harvey","You know we haven't updated any rate base estimates based on the PD, Jonathan. We just have sort of the original filing. You probably can back into it by just kind of looking at what the proposed decision would disallow, but we've not actually done that.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just wondered. So there's nothing sort of quirky we need to think about then, Kent. We could probably just take the numbers that are face value and adjust, is that...","Kent M. Harvey","I think you'll get pretty close that way, Jonathan.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then secondly, more to do with the process. I missed the first couple of minutes. But, Tony, I believe you mentioned that, yes, you'd be -- having a mediator would still be something you guys would be in favor of. Is there sort of a time frame whereby you'd want to sort of see progress with these talks? And how long do we have to sort of figure out whether we're going to be talking or litigating?","Anthony F. Earley","I've given up predicting time frames. I have said often, I wanted to try and get the proceedings behind us by the end of the year. I guess until December 31, we could still get an agreement in principle. It -- now it's probably unlikely to get the agreement and get it through the regulatory approval process with just 2 months left in the year. But I think the important piece is getting the parties together, and we do believe that given the complexity and the multiple parties that all have different interests, that getting a mediator would be helpful. The discussions around George Mitchell, if you read a lot of the filings, were not an objection as such to a mediator. It was about the process of selecting that particular mediator, even though his credentials were superb. And so we're -- we've gotten back to the parties and suggested that let's see if we can get another mediator.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. And so it was reported -- I think CPSD filed on Friday that you were going to have a -- there was going to be a meeting today and an update to the ALJ November 1. Is that still the -- is that the sort of the latest and greatest?","Anthony F. Earley","Yes. I'm not going to comment on the specific timetable of any meetings, Jonathan. But I can tell you, I mean, there isn't a day that goes by that we're not working that issue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin with Citigroup.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just to clarify a comment you made on Slide 9. You said that unrecovered expenses on the expense side of things could be double what we're showing here. I just want to make sure I understand that, that is the difference row that you're looking at for '13 and '14, that would be largely a number we can take twice as large now on that difference line if we were to update for the most recent estimates?","Kent M. Harvey","Brian, that's correct. This is Kent. And essentially, the main driver here is the pressure testing. And I think we've talked in the past, on prior calls, that our unit costs there have been in excess of $1 million a mile and our filing, including the contingency, was more in the range of $600,000 per mile. So when you apply that to about 350 miles we have planned for 2013 and 2014, you get a number, an increment, above that $130 million that's about equivalent to that amount.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Majority of my questions have already been answered. But I do have a question regarding the PSEP proposed decision. It strikes me that -- and please correct me if you think I'm wrong here, that the proposed decision in sort of opining that you should earn a modified equity return on the investments you're making that are deemed prudent and useful would sort of be selectively regulating you differently from the same types of investments that are being made by other utilities in the state to comply with the same plans. So if you -- they were ultimately to approve that, if the CPUC ultimately approve that, do you have recourse in the courts? Because it's essentially selective ratemaking on similar investments. And also does it just sort of blur the lines between the penalty phase, which is in the OIIs and this OIR, which is supposed to deal with capital investments and related to these new rules?","Anthony F. Earley","Well, I think we'll take your comments in the transcript and use that as our brief because those are exactly the points that we'll make. We think that's inappropriate. If the work is work that we ought to be doing and that we're going to get recovery of, then we ought to get recovery, full recovery of it, including a allowed return on equity on that, and we'll be making that point of not only -- we won't wait for appeal. We'll wait -- we'll make that point when we go to the commission. Remember this is a proposed decision. And we'll be making our points with the commission, and then they'll make their decision.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with UBS.","James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a quick question, more of a modeling type, but how do you guys think about your long-term effective tax rate going forward? Because I know last year and this year, whether it's the quarter or the trailing 9 months, it's sub-30%. How should we think about that on a sustained basis?","Kent M. Harvey","Jim, this is Kent. We don't exactly provide guidance on our tax -- effective tax rate in future years. But obviously, the last few years have been very unusual with bonus depreciation, very, very unusual. And at some point, we will see that kind of get back to normal going forward. I think the other thing is just, going forward, we do have a lot of questions about what will tax policy be. We don't know whether or not bonus will be continued beyond this year. But then there's lots of other proposals out there for tax policy. So that one's going to be a tough one to wrap our minds around at this point.","Gabriel B. Togneri","I think I'd also remind -- this is Gabe. I'd remind everybody that we have said over the last few years, we've had a number of sort of overhanging tax issues that we had settled from many years ago. Those are being worked down very rapidly, and we would expect that we would not have that level of tax issues to be working through in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess 2 quick questions, hopefully. When the settlement discussions are going on or when the procedural calendar, I guess, was suspended, there was a date of November 1, where -- I want to know, does the procedural calendar start up again? Just what happens on that November 1 date. And the second question, the company seems optimistic, or even the interveners, that a mediator would work best. But the selection of Mitchell's team, definitely created a very charged atmosphere out there in California, I mean, who -- was it the CPUC or was it the utility that was really driving the selection of Mitchell?","Anthony F. Earley","Well, I'll start off with that second part of that question. It was the CPUC's process selection and contacted the Senator, not the utility. And I'll let Tom comment on the procedural schedule going forward.","Thomas E. Bottorff","This is Tom Bottorff from Regulatory Affairs. The only procedural issue at this point for November 1 is waiting for CPUC to report on the progress of the discussion at that point with the ALJs in proceeding. So that's the next significant date in the process.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Do the hearings start up again? Or the -- like I -- I thought there were still some more hearings to go on maybe like 6 or something like that. Do they start automatically on November 1, or they're still suspended?","Thomas E. Bottorff","Those hearings are suspended. If they do resume, it wouldn't be until November 26.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar Securities Research.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Real quick, I wondered if there was any precedent for CPUC for offering a lower ROE on any kind of capital investment.","Kent M. Harvey","Travis, this is Kent. We did have experience back in the '90s where the PUC authorized all the utilities to have a lower return on other generation assets, and that's the one that comes to mind for me.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Is there any kind of correlation there that you could use on an appeal basis, or anything involved in that?","Kent M. Harvey","I don't know that that decision at the time was appealed by the utilities. It was all part of industry restructuring at the time, wrapped into a very complex dynamic going on in regulation.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Sure, okay. And then real quick, the financing plan, if that proposed decision were to be approved, would that be pretty much in line with capital expense and operating spec spend? Or would there be some kind of timing issue there in terms of equity and debt issuance?","Kent M. Harvey","Well, the proposed decision essentially has similar capital to what we had planned, and it essentially says, \"Go ahead and get the work done. You just won't get recovery of all your capital.\" And on the expense side, again, it's get the work done without the contingencies that you need to complete the expense amount. I would say on the margin, the impact of the proposed decision, because of the disallowances, on the margin, it will drive somewhat more equity issuance than long-term debt in order to finance the overall program. And essentially, the after tax amounts of the write-ups drive some incremental equity issuance. That's the way to think about it if you're modeling it.","Operator","Our first -- our next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just -- yes, maybe 2 mechanical questions. Number one, Kent, could you talk a little bit about how and when you would assess having to revise the expected fine from $200 million to another number?","Kent M. Harvey","I'm sorry, Dan. Can you restate your question? I couldn't hear it all.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. I'm sorry about that. Can you just walk through a little bit the process for reevaluating the level of fine you guys are assuming in your numbers in equity rate, so far as adjusting the $200 million to a new number?","Kent M. Harvey","Yes. Dan, we actually do that assessment every quarter. And essentially, the thought process we go through is we look at all the information available to us, through the regulatory process and otherwise, and to try to assess whether or not $200 million is still at the lower end of a reasonable range. And you can infer from our reporting this quarter and the quarter before and so forth that we've not had a basis for increasing that reserve to this point.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess one other question. Can you just tell us where you are as far as authorization for more equity issuance? I mean, could you turn on the DRIP in the fourth quarter or next year? Is there new authorization that has to occur?","Kent M. Harvey","If you're talking about the 401(k) and dividend reinvestment, if it's that DRIP, that -- those are our internal programs and that's fine. On the dribble program, we do have authorization. But the program we have, I don't remember exactly how much is left in it, but it's something like $60 million or $70 million left. Of course, we could replace that with another program when the timing was appropriate.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just to clarify a few things. The mediator, the other parties are not objecting, you said, to a mediator. Is that -- did they want a mediator? Is that -- do I understand that correctly?","Anthony F. Earley","All we can read into is -- if you saw some of their public statements objecting to Senator Mitchell, and a number of the public statements and letters specifically said they don't have a problem with a mediator, I guess it was the selection process for the Senator that they were concerned with. And so we will be now raising the issue of, okay, are there other mediators, and of course, there are dozens and dozens of very successful mediators out there. And we'll suggest the -- there's a process that we ought to go through and select one.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","How long do you think that might take?","Anthony F. Earley","As I said before, I've given up predicting. We'll work it every day.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then on -- I think Travis was asking a question on the ROE reduction, and you mentioned the generation assets in the 1990s. And as I recall, there was some securitization there. Is there any discussion of securitization as a means of sort of dealing with this sort of low ROE asset? Theoretically, there could be a tax benefit for rate payers and what have you. I'm just speaking just in general the securitization. Any of the -- any of this -- the options or -- of strategy that's being discussed at all?","Anthony F. Earley","No, there hasn't been any discussion like that to date.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just on the actual ROE cost of capital case. The schedule doesn't look like it's changed. So I'm just wondering, given the slippage that we're seeing, not just in your case, just in general, I mean, it seems that the -- the PUC seems to takes some time quite often, more than scheduled. Do you still think we're really -- the schedule still holds for the -- I notice the testimony seemed to be filed and stuff. Just -- do you think it's still going to happen at that time, or any flavor on that?","Anthony F. Earley","Yes. I'm very hopeful that it will. And it's stayed right on schedule. The utilities -- everyone just filed their briefs last week. So it's chugging along. It's a fairly straightforward proceeding really, and we are hopeful that we'll have a final decision on phase 1 by year end.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just finally, the Safe Harbor -- there's been a few changes in Safe Harbor statement. And I noticed, I think, the addition of the nuclear issues, potential legislation or regulation, and I know you guys had some seismic stuff going on. But I'm just wondering, I don't believe I saw that last quarter. And I was just wondering, has there been any change that we should be thinking about on that area? It -- with the -- either with respect to seismic or post Fukushima or something like that, that we should be thinking about that has come up?","Gabriel B. Togneri","Paul, this is Gabe. It's really just our attempt to make sure that we're adequately covering everything in our disclosures, and specifically with these risk factors.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So there's not anything new that we should be -- that's developed that you're particularly concerned that we should be thinking about?","Anthony F. Earley","Well, I think we have disclosure. We're actually making progress in getting the approvals to do the seismic testing. So we're moving in the right direction there.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a handful of things. First of all, I want to make sure I follow your comments that when I look at Page 9 of the slide deck, the expense you will still show, even if it's more than what's on the slide, you will still show as a nonrecurring item impacting earnings. The capital and, therefore, any potential write-offs of capital, you'll show in the lower ROE. The capital write-offs you would show as nonrecurring items. But the lower ROE on which you are allowed to earn on, you will actually include in ongoing EPS.","Kent M. Harvey","A little different, Michael. The shortfall for expense, and for our recovery of capital, we would show as an item impacting comparability. It just gives you more transparency. You guys can keep track of the pieces that way. The ROE component that reduced return on the subsets of our rate base, which is related to the PSEP, that we would just put in earnings because that's really return rather than a cost.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay. Can you give -- I'm going to change topic off the PSEP a little bit. Can you give an update on the cash flow impacts expected for both Hinkley and the generator settlements?","Kent M. Harvey","I think I'll take Hinkley first. In the case of Hinkley, most of what you've been seeing here have been accruals related to the whole house water situation, and those are fairly near term -- and property purchases. So they're fairly near-term items for -- like the accruals we've done this quarter. When you look at our overall accruals, one is up for Hinkley, there's a significant amount that is really over a very long period of time. That's the remediation of the chromium itself, and that goes on for years. So it really depends which part, but these most recent accruals will be nearer term because we're, essentially, in the process right now of providing those options and the residents have selected them. The second thing in terms of the generator settlements, Gabe, do you want to take that one?","Gabriel B. Togneri","Yes. Michael, on the generator settlements, there's really no news there other than what we said, I believe, on our last 10-K. And I think as everybody who's followed us knows, there is an overhang of several hundred million dollars or more that will require financing if all of the remaining generator claims that haven't been settled were settled all at once. That's fairly unlikely. We're having small settlements over time. But at some point, what remains will probably have to be decided by FERC.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And coming back on the Hinkley, just want to make sure I follow. Have the cash flow impacts mirrored the earnings impacts over the last year or so, or are the accruals solely for anticipated future cash flow spending on the more near-term items, Kent, that you addressed?","Kent M. Harvey","The cash flow impact, it really only mirrored the accruals reasonably closely. I mean, there's always a little bit of a lag, but it's really for this whole house water and property purchase. And even that, there's somewhat of a lag, certainly within quarters. It's the final remediation which we've taken significant accrual for, that does not mirror the cash flows at all. The cash flows will be much more gradual on that one.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan [ph] with Visium Asset Management.","Unknown Analyst","Sorry, I joined a little bit late, Kent, so I don't know if it was addressed. Can you just talk about -- there was a note from the rating agencies that came out last week, which had negative implications from the proposed order. Can you just talk about what your conversation with the rating agencies are? And what is -- in your view, how does the company try to maintain its credit ratings where they are? Is that a focus? Could you share your thoughts there, please?","Kent M. Harvey","Well, we have been in conversations with the rating agencies once the PD from the PSEP came out. In many ways I like letting the rating agencies speak for themselves in their own reports, and obviously, people have access to the agencies themselves. I will say the way I look at the issue is it's not simplistically a numerical issue where you just look at our credit ratios. It's not that. I think the rating agencies to me it's more important to really be focusing on the overall appropriateness of the resolution of all the gas issues and whether or not that continues to signal a balanced regulatory environment in California or not. And I think that's really the key indicator that I believe the rating agencies are focused on.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. So it's more of a qualitative issue than a quantitative issue?","Kent M. Harvey","I think that's fair.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And then, can I just -- so the time line still remains, right? There's been no change in the time line regarding -- right? There was a November 26 drop-dead date before the OIIs fine was to come out. That still remains intact, is that correct, or am I wrong?","Kent M. Harvey","That date is scheduled for the end of November. And whether it comes out or not depends on the status or success or progress in the negotiations that are ongoing.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. So -- but those dates have not been changed, right?","Kent M. Harvey","No.","Operator","There are no additional questions waiting from the phone lines.","Gabriel B. Togneri","All right. In that case, I will wish everybody a safe day. Please stay inside and make sure you and your family are protected. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for attending the Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This would now conclude the conference.

First, I'll detail some of the detrimental financial impacts that are occurring, due to the California's flawed policies in the extreme wildfire conditions that have become our new normal. I'll then provide a view of the legislative and legal landscape, including the solutions that our coalition continues to push for in Sacramento. And finally, I'll cover the operational progress we've made with our community wildfire safety program.","It's been nearly 10 months since last October's devastating wildfires and our thoughts remain with the impacted communities as they recover. These communities include our customers, our workforce, our family and friends. We are there on the ground with operational and customer service team members helping them with the rebuild process.","Now we've talked on past calls about the increased risk of extreme weather and wildfires that we're facing as a state, but we're experiencing that new normal now. Another fire season is upon us and we've already seen several sizable fires across the western United States and of course here in California. In the same way that we need to take action to make our states, communities and infrastructure more resilient, it's critical that we address our public policies.","Yesterday's laws won't help our state deal with the impact of tomorrow's wildfires. Now, let me be clear here. The reforms we seek would not absolve investor-owned utilities from responsibility. Negligence claims against PG&E can still be pursued and the California Public Utilities Commission, which should retain the authority to investigate our conduct and reject any costs that are not just and reasonable. But where we acted reasonably, we cannot be put in the position of being held strictly liable for damages without the ability to recover those costs. The strict liability construct that is applied to investor-owned utilities in California today is unsustainable and is already having very real consequences.","As we shared at the end of June, we took a $2.5 billion non-cash charge this quarter for 14 of the 16 Northern California wildfires for which Cal Fire has concluded its investigations. We're also seeing negative impacts in the insurance markets as providers are adjusting to the increased frequency and severity of wildfires across the state, coupled with the unsustainable strict liability standard. Jason will cover this in greater detail. But we are seeing significant increases in insurance premium costs as compared to just a few years ago.","Additionally, we have experienced downgrades from the three major rating agencies. And S&P placed our sister utilities to the south on negative watch, pending the outcome of this legislative session. All of these outcomes have negative consequences for our customers and our state. As you know, the credit downgrades have a direct correlation on financing costs. And higher financing costs translate into higher customer bills. For every 100 basis point increase in our total cost of capital, it's the equivalent of a roughly $400 million increase to the costs that are borne by our customers.","At the end of the day, our state's infrastructure investments require access to affordable capital. And as I've said before, while we will never sacrifice safety-driven work, as long as these flawed policies remain in place, we must carefully evaluate whether we can support our current level of capital expenditures. For example, we may need to pull back on some of the clean energy projects that are so critical to our state's ability to meet its bold clean energy goals. We were pleased to see that the California Public Utilities Commission approved our request to delay our 2020 general rate case application by up to four months to January 1, 2019 This will allow us time to thoughtfully consider and reassess our investment plan once we have greater clarity from any reforms that may come from \u2013 that may come about during this legislative session.","We also recognize that our shareholders will require a return commensurate with the risk they are taking. As a result, if we don't see meaningful reforms from this legislative session, I expect that we will request an elevated cost of financing in our upcoming cost of capital proceeding to fully reflect the increased risk our company faces.","Action is required now. So let me be really specific about the solutions our coalition is seeking in Sacramento. First, permanent reform to the strict liability standard under inverse condemnation is critical. Second, the legislature needs to directly address the effects of the climate driven 2017 wildfires on California investor-owned utilities. And finally, we need clarity around how our regulators use compliance with the operational standards to which we hold ourselves accountable.","Many stakeholders are pleased to see the governor along with key legislative leaders recently form a Wildfire Preparedness and Response Conference Committee to consider potential solutions to these issues. And just yesterday, the Conference Committee held its first hearing which is an important first step. The issues raised yesterday related to safety and the prudent management concepts are critical. We would expect that the Committee will also consider the governor's outreach and proposal as part of their process.","The governor's proposal as a stand-alone measure represents some progress on reforming strict liability, but it's insufficient. And it's important to keep in mind that this is just one element of a more comprehensive set of solutions that are needed.","That's why we think it's appropriate that the Committee is tasked with considering a wide ranging set of preparedness, response, resiliency and other policy reforms. All of which will be important as they complete their work over the next few weeks.","In parallel, our efforts on the legal front continue, where we are challenging inverse condemnation in the courts. Just last week, we filed a writ in the First District Court of Appeals to challenge the application of inverse condemnation, to the October 2017 wildfires.","Finally I will now highlight some of the important operational work we've done as part of our Community Wildfire Safety Program. While we press for solutions on the legal and legislative fronts, we are not waiting. We are moving quickly to implement additional measures intended to further mitigate wildfire risk.","Our Wildfire Safety operation center is up and running 24\/7 during the height of the wildfire season. This center provides us with greater situational awareness across our system, including our high fire risk wildfire areas. It improves our ability to collaborate with third-party agencies such as Cal OES and Cal Fire. And it enables more timely responses to both existing wildfires and any potential threats.","We've also procured two helicopters to assist operations and are making them available to support first responders with addressing wildfires. During late June and early July, these helicopters are utilized by Cal Fire, to support efforts for a number of fires including the Pawnee and County fires.","We've been performing daily aerial fire detection patrols across thousands of miles of our service territory, to assist both state and federal agencies with early fire detection and response. Seven planes are flying daily routes over the next several months providing near real-time information to our Wildfire Safety Operations center. Our program to disable reclosers and circuit breakers has been expanded during the height of the wildfire season as yet another measure to further mitigate wildfire risk. And in situations with the most extreme fire conditions, we are prepared to proactively de-energize targeted circuits.","While we view this as a last resort, it's a serious effort we'll execute on under specific circumstances. This of course would be done in consultation with CAL OES and other third party agencies. In fact all of the efforts I've described are done in close partnership with our communities and agencies. We've held over 250 in-person meetings with city and county officials, community organizations, customers, and others over the last several months. The safety of our communities and our workforce is our greatest responsibility. And we will continue to identify and implement programs to mitigate the increased wildfire risk that we face.","Before I turn it over to Jason, I'll just close by saying how important the next month will be for energy providers, our customers, suppliers and the State of California. PG&E is committed to helping deliver on California's clean energies goal. And we recognize that investor-owned utilities are critical to meeting these aspirations. Time is of the essence though. With the recent formation of the Conference Committee, we believe the right process is in place to thoughtfully and comprehensively develop solutions to the complex problems faced by our state. We look forward to seeing solutions continue to come forth in the coming weeks. Of course, we will continue to keep you apprised as meaningful updates occur.","And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Jason to provide you with an update on the financials.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Thank you, Geisha, and good morning, everyone. Before we dive into the financial results, I'll first cover our insurance renewal for the policy period that runs from August 1 of this year through the end of July 2019. As Geisha mentioned, we have seen dramatic changes in the insurance market for California investor-owned utilities, with increased pressure on both price and capacity. Some carriers have significantly reduced their exposure by reducing limits or excluding events that were previously covered, and all have significantly increased their premiums.","In response to this changing environment, we've taken an innovative approach to financial risk transfer with several different products. You can think about this as a stacked approach to addressing our needs. First, we plan to obtain traditional insurance to cover all perils, including events such as wildfires. For most that \u2013 from the most financially stable carriers.","Second, we intend to increase coverage for third-party property damage due to wildfires through the reinsurance market. And third, we're actively exploring a capital market solution, via catastrophe or CAT bond which would be additive to the wildfire specific property damage coverage I just mentioned.","In total, we are seeking to transfer approximately $1 billion to $1.5 billion of financial risk to the insurance and capital markets. We expect to have agreements for this coverage executed in the coming days. The cost of this coverage is expected to be roughly $350 million annually, which exceeds the amount that we're currently recovering in rates by around $300 million.","Last month, the California Public Utilities Commission authorized our Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account or WEMA. In addition to claims and legal costs, this account enables us to track insurance premium costs that are incremental to what we're recovering in rates on a retroactive basis, to the end of July 2017.","As a result, we've recorded a regulatory asset for $69 million this quarter related to incremental premium costs that we have been paying since last August, $32 million of which relates to premium costs from 2017, it has been recorded as an item impacting comparability. The regulatory asset also includes $37 million for incremental premium cost incurred in the first and second quarters of 2018.","On an annualized basis, we expect to record roughly $80 million in incremental insurance costs as a regulatory asset in 2018 and 2019. Cost for premiums in excess of the approximately $50 million we are currently recovering in rates, as well as the $80 million we plan on recording as a regulatory asset will be included in earnings from operations until reset in the 2020 GRC. We do, however, intend to seek recovery for the full amount of premium costs paid in excess to the amount we're currently recovering from customers through the end of this GRC period.","Moving now to our financial results for the quarter as shown on slide 5. Earnings from operations came in at $1.16 per share. Our GAAP loss including the items impacting comparability are also shown here. Costs associated with the Northern California wildfire has totaled roughly $2.2 billion pre-tax. There are several components included here that I will walk through.","First, this includes the $2.5 billion charge that we have taken for 14 fires of 16 fires for which Cal Fire has concluded it's investigation. Second, it includes legal and other support costs of $46 million pre-tax. Third, we have determined that a portion of the Catastrophic Event Memorandum Account regulatory asset associated with cleanup and repair costs is no longer probable of recovery, resulting in a $40 million pre-tax write-off. Finally, we recorded $375 million pre-tax for expected insurance recoveries.","Moving on, pipeline-related expenses were $12 million pre-tax for the quarter. We reported $10 million pre-tax for legal costs associated with the Butte fire. Finally, as I mentioned previously we recorded $32 million pre-tax for the 2017 component of expected recovery of insurance premiums above the amounts we're currently collecting in rates.","Moving on, slide 6 shows a quarter-over-quarter comparison of earnings from operations of $0.86 in the second quarter of last year to $1.16 for the second quarter of 2018. In the second quarter of 2017, there was a nuclear refueling outage with no similar outage in the second quarter of this year, resulting in $0.08 favorable. We were $0.06 favorable due to the resolution of several regulatory items.","As previously mentioned, we recorded $37 million pre-tax or $0.05 for the expected recovery of insurance premium costs for the first six months of 2018. Timing of taxes was $0.05 favorable. Consistent with previous quarters, our taxes fluctuate with the variability in earnings throughout the year, but ultimately will net to zero for the full year. We were $0.04 favorable due to growth in rate base earnings, which includes $0.02 unfavorable related to the timing of the 2017 GRC decision.","As we shared last quarter, we expect earnings from our rate base growth to be roughly $0.25 for the full year. Miscellaneous items accounted for $0.07 favorable. This is primarily driven by several timing-related items that are expected to reverse by year-end. We were $0.03 unfavorable due to the timing of the GRC cost recovery. In the second quarter of last year, as a result of the 2017 GRC decision, we recognized incremental revenues associated with capital costs such as depreciation and interest with no similar revenues in the second quarter of 2018. We were $0.01 unfavorable due to last year's settlement in our cost of capital proceeding, which resulted in a decrease in our authorized return on equity. We expect this to equal roughly $0.05 on an annualized basis. Share dilution result in a $0.01 unfavorable.","Moving on to slide 7 to other factors affecting earnings from operations in the lower right quadrant. As I highlighted in the quarter-over-quarter comparison on the previous slide, we recorded $0.05 in the second quarter to reflect recovery of excess insurance premium costs for the first six months of the year. We expect to record a similar amount in the second half of 2018. While there is regulatory risk associated with recovery of these costs and the amounts will not represent the full cost of the premiums going forward, we do expect this to favorably impact our earnings from operations results for the year.","Slide 8 shows our forecast of items impacting comparability. The forecast for pipeline-related expenses is consistent with what we shared on the first quarter call. The guidance range for Butte Fire-related costs net of insurance now reflects the high-end range of potential outcomes at $1.3 billion. The low end of the range is unchanged from last quarter at $1.1 billion.","Estimated Northern California wildfire-related costs net of insurance reflects both a $2.5 billion charge for claims and expected insurance recoveries that we recorded this quarter. In addition, this reflects the $40 million write-off of cleanup and repair costs that were determined to be no longer probable of recovery. Slide 9 and slide 10 show CapEx and rate base for both 2018 and 2019. While we're not changing guidance today, as Geisha highlighted, our capital plans could be impacted if we do not see constructive legislative reform this session. So I would expect this to have more significant impacts in 2020 and beyond.","Slide 11 outlines expected uses and sources of equity for the year. We have incorporated the charge we took for the Northern California wildfires net of insurance. The other items are consistent with what we shared last quarter. Through the second quarter, our internal programs have generated equity of roughly $80 million. Investment activity can vary throughout the year, but given our year-to-date results, internal programs may not generate the same levels of equity in 2018 that we've seen in recent years.","The cash that we're conserving from the dividend suspension continues to provide an equity cushion that could be used to provide needed equity, including for liabilities resulting from the Northern California wildfires. As of June 30 of 2018, our equity ratio was 51.7%, resulting in a pre-tax cushion of roughly $700 million, relative to the 51% minimum that would require a capital structure waiver.","Stepping back, as I shared in our call in June, the non-cash charge we recorded for the Northern California wildfires does not require the use of cash in the near-term. And as we look at future financing options, I will reiterate that the health of our balance sheet and the interest of our customers and shareholders will continue to be our top priorities.","In closing, I will reinforce that we are aggressively pushing for the policy changes that Geisha covered. We understand the urgency of the issues before us and recognize the importance of favorable resolutions for both our customers and shareholders.","So with that, let's open up the lines for questions.","Chris Foster - PG&E Corp.","Hi, Leesa. If you could open up the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Good morning, Stephen.","Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I wanted to touch on the cost of capital point that you raised, I think it's pretty clear that the cost of capital has increased in the state. But at a high level, is it possible to talk through sort of the methodology or the key elements of the changing cost of capital that we've seen for California Utilities overall? Since we've seen numerous, very large wildfires. What kind of key sort of points or key elements of that cost of capital methodology should we sort of keep in mind as we're trying to assess where that cost of capital might go?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Stephen, this is Jason. Thanks for the question. It's clear that our cost of capital has significantly increased this year. I mean, I think probably easiest place to look is the cost of our debt which is up roughly 100 basis points and we know that equity costs are a multiple of that. I think as we look forward, we continue to push and believe that constructive reform and inverse condemnation it's important to keep our cost of capital cost effective for our customers.","But in absence of legislative reform, I think we would have to consider the potential for future fire events. On what would be a sort of traditional foundation for the calculation of the cost of equity. And so in essence, I think, it's premature to quantify exactly how much but in absence of legislative reform, we could see significant increases in cost of capital that we could \u2013 that we would request next spring as part of the Cost of Capital proceeding.","Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. And then I guess I'm thinking about the large Tubbs Fire and possible outcomes. I guess one outcome is that there's a determination that your equipment was somehow involved but that there is no finding of a potential violation of vegetation management. So sort of this is the scenario in which you might have strict liability and yet not be negligent.","In that kind of a situation, how do you think about financing such a large amount of capital that would be required? Absent legislation or then, I guess, we can also talk about possible legislative fixes but it's obviously a large amount of money. How would you think about that kind of scenario?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Stephen, this is Jason again. I think it's premature to speculate as to exactly sort of the financing plans under a hypothetical, Cal Fire still hasn't released its conclusion on Tubbs. But I will emphasize from a matter of principle standpoint is as I indicated in my opening comments, if we were to take a non-cash charge that dropped us below our required minimum equity ratio of 51%, we'd first file a capital structure waiver with the Commission. That capital structure waiver would be considered to be approved until acted upon.","We think that the capital structure waiver is in the best interest of our customers. It provides the legislature and the courts time to deal with inverse condemnation. And so, there are a number of factors that would need to be resolved before we quantify and articulate the exact financing approach for the situation that you outlined.","Stephen C. Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Very much understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Good morning.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","There's a lot going on today and I think I heard most of what you said, Geisha, at the beginning. But I think you said you felt that \u2013 you were encouraged by the governor's proposal on IC but it wasn't sufficient. I'm not sure if you meant you need to see other things as well or were you commenting on the specifics of that proposal?","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Yeah. So I think that the governor's proposal is constructive but as I said earlier we do believe it's insufficient. We think it's just one of many things that need to be considered in a more comprehensive set of reforms relating to inverse condemnation, relating to the wildfire reforms that are needed in the state of California. So, it's an important input, I think, to the Conference Committee, but it's \u2013 I think a lot more work is necessary.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","What kind of things that it doesn't do would you like to see and my reading of it was that it looks like you would still have a lot of uncertainty, if the court don't decide until sort of some long time after an event, what your liability for it might be? I'm just curious what you're \u2013 what are the elements of what you'd like to see that are not there...","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Yes, we've always been really pretty clear about our expectations, our \u2013 what we want to see accomplished in the legislature this year, and it's threefold. It's strict liability reform under Inverse Condemnation permanently. It's addressing the 2017 wildfire costs in the most cost effective manner possible. And it's also having clarity around reasonableness standards and really the whole cost recovery perspective from a CPUC proceeding basis.","So, when I say that it's insufficient, it doesn't go far enough. And looking at inverse condemnation and the impact that it has on utilities like PG&E and the State of California.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. And then, can I also ask on the \u2013 do you have any insight into the CPUC investigative timeline and when we might see those reports start to emerge and I guess within that, do you know if they have seen the reports into the fires with the violations and what would \u2013 I think they've said publicly that they expect to come out reasonably promptly after Cal Fire, but we've not seen anything yet?","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Right, Jonathan, to answer the question directly, no. we really don't have any insights as to the timing of SED or more broadly the CPUC investigations on any of these fires. We're hoping that it's prompt. But, again, we have no insight as to what their thinking will be in terms of timing.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, could I \u2013 Jason, I apologize for this. But I felt that it was moving quick. And then, you said that your insurance cost is now $300 million higher than what's in rates. And the overall package you're expecting to cost you $350 million annually. Did I hear that right?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","That's correct, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then, there was \u2013 some of that you're despairing assuming recovery under the WEMA, but some you are not. Could you just resay that part.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Yeah. About $80 million of the amount that is in excess of what we're currently collecting in rates would be deferred as a regulatory asset in WEMA. The rest would fall to the bottom line. Although, I do want to emphasize, as I mentioned, that we will seek full recovery for those costs.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","The difference between $300 million and $80 million falls to the bottom line , that's on an annual basis. So you're also saying you expect it to be a positive earnings driver year-over-year. So is the difference then cost saving or something else or how do we reconcile that?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Yes. So while we didn't provide you per share guidance for 2018, when we set our financial plan for the year, we did anticipate higher insurance costs.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","And when we set that plan, we set it with the objective of earning our authorized return on equity. The WEMA regulatory asset that we recognized for insurance cost this quarter is incremental to that.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So said another way, you had assumed that your insurance \u2013 the amount by which insurance cost would impact your numbers this year would be more than $220 million, effectively.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","I think that's fair.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Good morning. I had a lot of the same questions. So, I apologize. These will be clarifications. So, the \u2013 on the insurance, the $350 million annually, is that a 2018 annualized number? So...","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Yeah. That'll be the cost from August 1 of 2018 through July 31 of 2019.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So, you weren't absorbing in your plan all $350 million in 2018. It would have been, I guess, by 2019?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","That's correct.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","In theory? Okay. Okay. So in theory, that would be a 2019 pressure that you'll be absorbing or recovering by then. Got it. Okay.","And then on the \u2013 Geisha, I apologize going back to the governor's plan being insufficient comment. Obviously, one way it's insufficient versus what you've stated is it does specifically doesn't address the 2017 fires. But could you just clarify outside of that issue, how that plan is insufficient? With maybe a little more detail?","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Yeah. So, it's \u2013 it really doesn't address the third item that we typically have called for, which is having, in essence, pre-prudency review. Having an opportunity to look at clarifications around what constitutes being in compliance, what constitutes being a prudent manager, I think that's important. As we've seen from the San Diego Gas & Electric WEMA refusal I guess or, not accepting the rehearing, it's a big issue for us.","And when you consider the fact that we're in this new normal, the fact that we have more wildfires it seems every year, very severe wildfires, we've got to look at this whole issue of wildfire reform, inverse condemnation reform, liability reform more broadly, more comprehensively. So that's why I believe that it's insufficient.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. And then one last question, I'm sure you heard the Cal Fire comments on Tubbs yesterday, I don't know if you have any color from your standpoint on those comments. And just how \u2013 if the Tubbs Fire report is not out by the end of the legislative session, what does that mean for getting legislation done?","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Well let me first talk about that. I mean, clearly, the Tubbs Fire is so significant, so devastating, but I believe that, and what we've been talking about at the legislature is that the reform that we're seeking is so much more than just Tubbs. It's so much more than just 2017. It's so much more than just PG&E. We find ourselves in this climate-driven extreme weather, facing wildfire after wildfire. The numbers that we're seeing already in California and in the Western United States are staggering. So this is going to be a perennial issue. And our focus in addressing legislation is about we've got to come up with new solutions, new legislation that deals with this new normal.","So while \u2013 I don't know what the impact would be of Tubbs being delayed one way or the other. But I think the time for action is now as we're dealing with wildfire after wildfire today. And having clarity about what utility liability is going to be in the future is going to be so important to our ability to raise capital, to our ability to be a financial utility, to our ability to execute on our plan to achieve California's clean energy goal.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thank you. Go ahead.","John R. Simon - PG&E Corp.","It's John Simon. Just on another part of your question, we really don't have insight into the timing beyond what Cal Fire has said publicly. I did want to emphasize though that ultimately the question of the cause of the fires and PG&E's role if any in them is going to end up being an issue in the litigation.","So, whenever Cal Fire says what its determination is, it's going to be their finding but it's not going to be dispositive of PG&E's liability. And we do expect the plaintiff's lawyers who have filed suits in San Francisco to pursue theories, whatever Cal Fire says. They've asserted two theories, the inverse theory that we've talked about before and negligence as well.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Please proceed.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. How are you? Sorry to beat a dead horse on this question on the governor's proposed language in the legislation. But my first question is as it pertains to his willingness to support guidance to the courts that would establish a proportionality standard, does that in and of itself eliminate strict liability if it were passed as written on a going forward basis?","Steven E. Malnight - PG&E Corp.","Hi. Greg, this is Steve Malnight. I think as Geisha said, the governor's proposal clearly weighs in on some elements. You mentioned the elements he weighed in on, inverse reform; I think we're still fully vetting the specifics of that proposal. But I would just again highlight, as Geisha said, it is an input to the process that the Conference Committee is undergoing. They had their first hearing yesterday. I expect them to look at the governor's proposal along with proposals from many other parties. And I think we have to see what emerges from that process to really assess its impact on the issues that Geisha mentioned that California is facing.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. I get that you don't want to answer that question specifically. But from a direction and perspective in a philosophical direction, even if it's not worded exactly the way you would like, does it show that there is a way to move away from a strict liability standard that doesn't fundamentally have to go through a constitutional elimination of inverse?","Steven E. Malnight - PG&E Corp.","Look, I'll say this, Greg. I think that the \u2013 as we've asserted, reforming inverse does not require a constitutional amendment. It can be done by the legislature. I think we heard that in the hearing yesterday from multiple parties who testified in the hearing. And I think the governor's proposal puts forward a methodology to accomplish that as well. So, I think the issue of reforming inverse, as we've said, is something the legislature can take on and needs to take on in order to really address the challenges that California faces.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Appreciate that one. One other question, Jason, I know you also didn't want to opine as to just some sort of specific financing path. Should you wind up having to have significant liabilities for the fires, but ultimately if you're compelled to take charges associated with the payment of fire claims that are unrecoverable, should we assume that in the end, that they'd be finance \u2013 that you'd need to replenish those write-downs with equity? That there may be multiple financing paths over time, that allow you to bridge that. But in the end, write-downs associated with those theoretical costs, should they be incurred, would they have to be financed with equity?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Yeah. Greg, thanks for the question. I do think that you summed it up there, in the end, ultimately the equity needs will need to be financed with some form of equity. But there could be multiple paths on an interim basis before issuing that incremental equity to fill our equity ratio at the utility.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you, sir. Take care.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Please proceed.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much. Hi, guys. Just following up on that question, if there is, let's say, securitization with AB 33 that goes through, you have a bridge, at least for some time, until you have a decision on what happens around prudency reviews at CPUC. But if you win some of these court battles around the Supreme Court, California Supreme Court, which kind of have a view around whether maybe you're liable under inverse, would that result in no equity need? Or could that be the upside case where securitization almost bridges to a solution on the court side?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Praful, I think you're highlighting the complexity of the situation why it's hard to commit exactly to a path. There's \u2013 we're pushing forward on reform at the legislative level. We're challenging inverse in the court system. There are a lot of different paths that can take. And so, what we can commit to in the near term is that if we fall below the equity \u2013 minimum equity ratio at the utility because of a non-cash charge, we are committed to filing a capital structure waiver at the Commission to mitigate financing needs so that we can fully pursue resolution under those multiple paths.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Understood. But securitization at least in the near term is a bridge to some other legal solution. Is that a fair way to think of that?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","It's possibly. I mean AB 33 as currently constructed would provide a mechanism to pay claims. Essentially today, it would give the Commission the opportunity to disallow cost down the road which if disallowed would require a different form of financing at that point.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Got you. Fair enough. And then secondly, on the Senate Bill 901 and all the language on what the governor supporting as well, it seems like Senate Bill 901 actually has language in it right now as it's drafted right now that kind of addresses IC at least to some extent.","Is that something that you would see as a potential path forward in terms of what you could see final shape around addressing IC or how are you kind of thinking about with all these bills floating around, how do you kind of see that progressing given we're coming down to crunch time at this time?","Steven E. Malnight - PG&E Corp.","Hi. Thanks. This is Steve Malnight again. So, just to kind of clarify the process. So Senate Bill 901 was amended really just to set sort of a scope of work that the Conference Committee would take on. It really, as of now, is a bit of a shell and was moved into the Conference Committee for their action.","So, what we would expect to see is that as that the Conference Committee debate solutions and puts them forward in legislative language, they would be amended into 901, and then the Committee would consider 901 in total and pass it back to both chambers for a vote. So I think what you see in 901 today is really not what it will be in the end. It's really just \u2013 it's a shell with some clarification of the scope that the Committee intends to take on.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. But so I guess within the next few weeks, by the end of August, we're expecting that to kind of take shape in terms of addressing IC in 901 or do you expect another bill like 1088 or something else?","Steven E. Malnight - PG&E Corp.","No. I think the current expectation is that the Conference Committee will likely be the primary source of potential solutions. That's what it was formed to do. They will be debating that and putting it in 901. As you mentioned, the session ends at the end of August. So as Geisha said, the next month is really critical. But the Committee was formed really to do this work and we're looking forward to working with them through the month to hopefully see the solutions emerge in 901.","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","I mean, obviously, we're really pleased that there's a Conference Committee where there is laser-like focus I think in terms of looking at inverse, looking at wildfire preparedness and response more broadly. I think it's the right approach to tackle such a complex issue as what we're dealing with here in California.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Thanks, Geisha. Thanks, Jason, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Good morning.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. So perhaps just to clarify Praful's last set of questions there. Just with respect to the shell of 901 and obviously you've got the AB 33 bill out there. I mean how do you think about this being sort of multiple parallel bills addressing various avenues and should we expect that to be the case or as the Committee continues here would you expect that different parts of the various proposals to kind of come together and a kind of a singular 901 bill to carry, the day just to clarify the last question?","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Well, we are advocating strongly that some level of looking at 2017, the AB 33 bill as it currently stands, we would love to see that moved into the Conference Committee. So, as they're looking at comprehensive reform they're looking not just at prospective but also looking at 2017 because it was just so, so substantial. If however AB 33 doesn't move into the Conference Committee, there's still an approach for more of a traditional legislative process in California. But I would have to say it's harder. It's more complicated.","So, again our focus is on making the work of the Conference Committee as comprehensive as possible to deal with this very complex set of issues, while at the same time working in parallel to continue to advance the good work of AB 33.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And while we're on the subject of AB 33, just to kind of understand, obviously, we want to look at retroactive and provide a framework. How do you think about the notion of prudency down the road and a refund scenario under that AB 33 legislation if you can kind of comment around that?","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Well, the current way that AB 33 is sort of set up, it's explicit about two things. First, the Commission must approve that the initial advice filing, it has to ensure lower cost for customers. And second, it provides for a reasonable review for all the wildfire costs incurred. So that if the CPUC determines that we did not act justly or prudently, then those \u2013 there will be disallowances and those disallowances will be shareholder-funded.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. All right. Excellent. And then maybe this is turning back to the more financial side of the house. Can you talk a little bit more about financing avenues? I know you alluded to it a little bit earlier in the questions, but sort of cumulatively potential cash outflows to fund some of these, let's call them one-time type efforts here, how do you think about capital raising efforts and sort of preemptively putting in place financing vehicles to any extent? I mean, obviously, you're, to a certain extent, doing that with these CAT bonds and in a certain context but more broadly, if you will.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Julien. This is Jason. Obviously, liquidity is clearly a focus for us. The $2.5 billion dollars of debt that we raised at the utility late in 2017 was intended to largely address our ongoing financing needs for 2018 and 2019, to give us the flexibility to work through the complexities that we've outlined.","As we've said, uncertainty with respect to legislative reform, the uncertainty with respect to the timing of the judicial challenges of inverse condemnation, create a challenging environment for incremental financing. That's why \u2013 I'll come back to our commitment at least early on if our non-cash \u2013 if we fall below the minimum equity ratio from a non-cash charge we will file a capital structure waiver. If that is denied, ultimately, we will look at other tools and we will seek to balance the balance sheet health of the company, but as well protect the interest of both our customers and shareholders. And I think just given all of the uncertainty it's hard to be any more specific than that at this time.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. So it seems like that you wouldn't necessarily be seeking to put much more preemptively in place beyond the specific liquidity and debt that you put in place last year.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","We have a few short-term debt maturity floating rate notes that we'll have to address. But as I mentioned, the debt offering at the Utility late in the fourth quarter largely met our debt financing needs for 2018 and 2019.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. All right. I'll leave it there. Thank you all very much. Best of luck.","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Thank you.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. And this may be a John Simon question, but I'm just curious. How do you balance the litigation paths that are outstanding and as you show in your slides may take some time, a year or two or so versus the claims that are coming in and the process and timeline for either settling or paying out claims, especially claims that are more inverse condemnation claims and not necessarily negligence claims? And there are obviously two suits outstanding challenging inverse condemnation, how do you balance that? And how do you think about just the cadence of things?","John R. Simon - PG&E Corp.","Let me take a run at it, Michael, and others here will jump in if I've sort of missed the spirit of the question. You're right to note we've got many trains running down many paths. Just timing-wise, our appeals on inverse condemnation are going to work their way through. The appeals we have right now are discretionary. If the courts accept them, then we have them pending in two different places, then you're looking at a timeline of nine months to a year and a half to deal with those. The litigation that's filed on the fires under the theories negligence and inverse, they're very early, early stages. We don't even have a case management conference yet, but that's coming up in a month. There's no trial date set, discovery is early. So, that's going to run its course over years. It's early.","And then you look at settling claims. If we were to do that, it's really early to talk about that now and here's why. We don't have the evidence that Cal Fire is relying on, we don't have most of their reports. It's really difficult to evaluate settlements and timing of settlements when we're in that position.","And so back to your question, we're pursuing aggressively our defenses on a number of fronts. We really want to understand Cal Fire's thinking. We don't understand it right now because we don't have anything substantive from them to talk about, sort of their alleged \u2013 their claims that PG&E may have alleged state law in its practices.","We don't have some nifty balance to thread needles on all of that. What we are doing is making every argument we can, defending vigorously and moving ahead. So, I don't have a great answer to that question, I'm afraid, but that's where we are.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then a question totally unrelated to wildfires. How do you think about the cadence or trajectory of capital spend? Just on core kind of rate base items. When you think about all of the dockets that are coming up, meaning the GRC, the TO cases, the GT&S case. You've got a lot going on in the regulatory arena, that'll have a significant impact on that $6 billion CapEx number for 2019 and beyond. How do you think about kind of the range that could be around that level?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Michael, this is Jason. As we've talked about in the past, while we haven't necessarily quantified capital spend beyond 2019, the pipeline for projects is extensive. We have an aging system that requires significant investment at a time when we need to modernize our grid for new technologies that our customers are demanding of us.","And so, the pipeline for capital investment is very strong. But as Geisha and I mentioned in our opening remarks, to the extent that we don't see constructive legislative reform of inverse condemnation this year, we may have to pull back on some of those \u2013 some of that aspect of spending. Because it just wouldn't be in our customers' best interest to finance some of those projects at the current cost of capital that we're experiencing.","So right now, it's hard to quantify beyond what we provided here, but I think as we get into the third quarter, we should be able to provide you more details.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And can you remind me, just what's the timing for the filing? I know you got the four-month delay on the core GRC. But what's the timeline for the other cases?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","We will file the Transmission Owner rate case before the end of this year. We have the four-month delay on the GRC. We have hearings for our GT&S rate case starting kind of mid-September timeframe. I think those are probably the three critical sort of cases for the remainder here of 2018.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, Jason. Much appreciated.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Turnure of JPMorgan.","Please proceed.","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. I just have a clarification on the last question on the court process. Is it fair that basically if you are granted your request at the Supreme Court in the Butte case that it really will not have an immediate impact on the Butte case or the Nor-Cal case at the lower court?","John R. Simon - PG&E Corp.","I think \u2013 Christopher, it's John. I think it will take some time, if the Supreme Court hears the appeal, then there'll be a process to brief the appeal, to argue the appeal and then for the court ultimately to decide the appeal one way or the other. So that will take some time. I can't predict the exact amount of time. The impact won't be immediate. It will be once the appeal's thoroughly reviewed, heard and argued and all the rest. So, it could be 6 months to 18 months, some sort of timeframe like that. It's really hard to predict.","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And as you said during that time, though lower court proceedings continue basically unaffected.","John R. Simon - PG&E Corp.","That's right. That's my understanding.","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then one other question on the Cal Fire testimony from yesterday, I'm wondering if in all your experience with Cal Fire investigations, Butte, other fires, et cetera, how frequently you've been aware of equipment being sent to third parties for review?","John R. Simon - PG&E Corp.","Yeah. Really I can't comment on that because I don't know one way or the other what Cal Fire may choose to do when it's doing its work to investigate a fire.","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","We don't have a lot of visibility to the inner workings of Cal Fire's investigative process. So, we don't know if this is highly unusual or something that they do more regularly. Really, there's no transparency on that.","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. But you haven't typically seen that in the past?","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Not that I'm aware of.","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please proceed.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning. How are you doing?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Good morning.","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Good morning.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","So, I appreciate your comments, all of which make a lot of logical sense. And I guess what my question sort of is from listening to the meeting, it was sort of highlighted during the public comments which were basically a lot of lobbyists it seemed to me. Was this substantial opposition from the insurance industry and municipalities regarding inverse condemnation. It seems like there's been this sort of ecosystem that's kind of developed there.","And I'm just wondering whether or not when you look at the legislative calendar and everything else, whether or not it's possible to focus on recovery of cost, the prudency stuff that you're asking about. The wildfire mitigation being recovered and then perhaps leaving inverse condemnation to the side, in an effort to get something through that addresses sort of the immediate financial issues that you guys are going to be confronting, as opposed to what appears to be what might be some significant opposition that starts to develop from powerful insurance and other industries. Basically trying to perhaps derail the process. Do you follow what I'm saying?","In other words, if there's some way of sort of addressing sort of some issues immediately, as opposed to just it maybe too big a lift. To address what \u2013 I agree with you, what really should be addressed. But maybe sort of just difficult in the current calendar environment that you got.","Steven E. Malnight - PG&E Corp.","Yeah. Hi, Paul. This is Steve Malnight. And I had just a couple of comments on that. I think \u2013 first of all, it is very apparent, that these issues are significant and meaningful to many groups and constituencies across California. That's completely consistent with what we've been saying, that these \u2013 the reforms that are needed, the comprehensive reforms, are really critical.","I think you can look to the statements that have come out previously from the governor and the legislative leaders on the need for action and the need for urgent action. You can look to the calling of the Conference Committee, which is an unusual step legislatively. And see within those the critical importance of this work and the importance for the legislature to weigh in.","I think it's also important to remember that this work didn't just start with the Conference Committee or the hearing yesterday, that was an important milestone. But obviously there've been a lot of discussions. There've been bills that have been put in front of the legislature and have been debated and worked on.","So at this point, we still are continuing to advocate for comprehensive reforms, because all of these issues are interrelated. The ability for us to both compensate victims and make sure our victims and the communities that suffered from these fires in 2017 can be made whole and rebuild.","The ability to keep our customer bills as low as possible going forward and the ability for us to have the financial certainty to continue to invest in the system. Those are the critical challenges that face California right now. And we continue to believe that the Conference Committee has got the right scope, they've got the right membership and the right process and we can deal with this this year. So, we're going to continue to advocate for that as we move forward and I think that that is possible for us to take on. I can't speculate on the outcomes and we'll continue to work our way through this process. But at this point, I think that's how I sort of view the next month.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Okay. Thank you.","Chris Foster - PG&E Corp.","Thanks, Paul. And, Leesa, thank you for hosting the call today. Everyone, I know we're at time, so I just want to thank everyone for joining us this morning and have a safe day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

All lines will be muted during the presentation portions of the call, with an opportunity for question-and-answers at the end.","At this time, I would like to pass the conference over to your host to, Chris Foster. Thank you and have a great conference. You may proceed, Mr. Foster?","Chris Foster - PG&E Corp.","Thank you, Lisa. And thanks to those of you on the phone for joining us. Before I turn it over to Geisha Williams, I want to remind you that our discussion today will focus on forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results, which are based on assumptions, forecasts, expectations, and information currently available to management.","Some of the important factors that could affect the company's actual financial results are described on the second page of today's first quarter earnings call presentation. The presentation also includes the reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures. We also encourage you to review our Quarterly Report on Form Q-10 (sic) [Form 10-Q] that will be filed with the SEC later today, and the discussion of risk factors that appear there and in the 2017 Annual Report.","With that, I'll hand it over to Geisha.","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide an overview of our initiatives to drive comprehensive, operational and policy solutions that address extreme weather-driven events, and the impact they're having on our communities, our company, and our state. I'll also be covering how we continue to advance our business strategy and position PG&E for the future, with examples that represent our vision of meeting the challenges of climate change while providing affordable energy for all of our customers. And finally, we'll close with Jason, walking us through the financial results for the quarter.","Nearly seven months have passed since the devastating wildfires that impacted our North Bay communities. Our thoughts continue to be with our customers, employees, families and friends who were affected. Nothing is more important to PG&E than the safety of our communities and workforce. And as I will speak to shortly, we are collaborating on a number of fronts to better prepare the community that we're privileged to serve in the face of future potential wildfires.","There was growing evidence that these wildfires may become more destructive in future years, and we must adapt. California investor-owned utilities are responding to this new normal. We have long been leaders in helping the state reduce its carbon footprint, and now we must lead in climate adaptation and resilience as well.","Our efforts include adapting our operations and infrastructure to changing climate conditions, as well as supporting efforts at the local level to make the communities we serve more resilient. Today, I'll cover what PG&E is specifically doing to tackle these complex issues. We continue to aggressively pursue strategies that address needed policy reforms for the near and long-term, while also enhancing our operations.","On the operational front, we've initiated an enhanced multi-year program to harden our system and increase its resiliency.","We're also working with regulators and other stakeholders to enhance procedures in high fire threat areas. On the legal front, we're addressing what we strongly believe is the inappropriate application of inverse condemnation to investor-owned utilities in the California Courts. And finally, we continue to advocate with leaders and policymakers across the state on comprehensive legislative solutions.","I'll focus first on the legislative front where a coalition of policymakers and other stakeholders are emphasizing the broader reforms needed to address issues such as forest management practices, wildland-urban interface, insurance availability, and utility liability among others. We think this is the right approach because there is no simple fix.","To that point, we were pleased to see the joint statement from Governor Brown and a bipartisan group of key legislative leaders who, in their words, will be partnering on solutions this year that will make California more resilient against the impacts of natural disasters and climate change. These leaders called up five key areas that addressed the issues our state is facing, including the need to update liability rules and regulations for utility services. It's important to have policies in place to provide a sustainable financial future for the state energy companies which is why we believe the Legislature needs to reform inverse condemnation.","As a reminder, California is an outlier in applying inverse condemnation liability to events caused by an investor-owned utility's equipment. This means that if the utility's equipment is found to have been a substantial cause of the damage in an event like a wildfire, even if the utility has followed established inspection and safety rules, the utility may be liable for property damages and attorneys' fees associated with that event.","So, in essence, this is a strict liability approach that presumes a commensurate cost recovery path and for investor-owned utilities that just isn't true. We strongly believe this is not the right approach for our customers or our shareholders. We also are encouraged to hear the members of the California State Senate and Assembly share their perspectives on the challenges that inverse condemnation presents for investor-owned utilities and the ripple effects it will have across the state.","They recognize that access to affordable capital is essential to funding utility infrastructure. This includes investments at scale that support the state's clean energy goals and enable the safety and the reliability of our system. It also includes funding that is necessary to transform and harden our system in the face of climate change.","We applaud the urgency to resolve these critical issues from both the governor and members of the Legislature and appreciate their commitment to timely and comprehensive solutions for all Californians. While we continue to work through the details with legislative leaders over the course of the session which ends in August, we seek common ground on many of the issues that have been raised and we look forward to collaborating on solutions.","I want to reiterate, however, that it is imperative that these policy reforms comprehensively address the full range of issues that are before us. And that of course includes inverse condemnation. I'll transition now to actions we've taken in the courts. We continue to believe that the CPUC's denial of cost recovery in San Diego Gas & Electric Electric Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account request presents compelling new evidence.","Investor-owned utilities cannot unilaterally raise rates without authorization from the regulator. And this fact alone undermines the entire premise of inverse condemnation. Earlier this week, the trial court denied our motion challenging inverse condemnation on the 2015 Butte Fire case. The court stated it believe it is bound by prior higher-level court decisions that have applied inverse condemnation to investor-owned utilities. Notably the court also acknowledged the importance of the issues we raised and stated that the appellate courts are the appropriate place to consider them. We intend to promptly file a request for the Court of Appeals to hear our case. The court also suggests that the Legislature considered the important public policy issues that are motion raised. We wholeheartedly agree.","Moving now to the Northern California wildfire cases, in March, we asked the court to dismiss the inverse condemnation causes of action in the 2017 Northern California wildfire cases that have been filed. We look forward to hearing the judge's decision in this case, but we again recognize that the issue of whether inverse condemnations should apply to investor-owned utilities likely will be decided by the appellate courts.","To the extent the outcomes are not in our favor as this issue was heard in various courts, we will continue to challenge inverse condemnation through all available legal avenues. Ultimately, we are fighting for a reasonable outcome not only for PG&E, but also the customers who we serve and the people of California.","At the same time, we're working with the California Public Utilities Commission and our communities on additional precautionary measures to enhance and strengthen our system. These efforts will build on the substantial work we have done across our system to proactively respond to the drought conditions that we have faced over the last few years.","We have more than doubled our annual spend to manage vegetation from roughly $190 million in 2013 to $440 million in 2017 and we increased the frequency of our patrols, particularly in high fire threat areas, but the new normal needs new solutions. To that end, we recently announced our Community Wildfire Safety Program.","While significant progress has been made since the wildfires last October, we view this as a multi-year program that will evolve over time. Our program has three core areas of focus and I will cover a few highlights this morning. First, we are bolstering our wildfire prevention and emergency response efforts in coordination with first responders, public safety agencies, and other community partners.","This includes establishment of a wildfire safety operation center that was opened last month. This center monitors wildfire risks and coordinates any necessary prevention and response efforts to first responders. And we've brought on our own wildfire response teams to protect critical utility infrastructure, assist crews working in high fire threat areas and to support first responders in the event of a fire.","We have also procured two helicopters that will support our wildfire response teams when wildfires occur and have plans to procure two more in 2019. Of course, this will all be under the direction of Cal Fire. To enhance our weather forecasting and modeling capabilities, we're targeting to add roughly 200 new PG&E-owned weather monitoring stations in 2018 with more to come in future years.","These stations will provide enhanced visibility of potential wildfire threats across our system. Second, we will be working with our communities on additional precautionary measures to help reduce the threat of wildfires and keep our communities safe.","For example, we're executing on an even more expansive vegetation management program. We were pleased to see the CPUC adopt new regulations that require increased distances between our wires and the surrounding vegetation. We're also creating fire safety zones in high fire threat areas. This means we'll be clearing vegetation from at least 15 feet on either side of our power line. This not only reduces wildfire risk but also enables easier access for first responders in the event a wildfire occurs.","In addition, we are refining and executing on protocols to proactively turn off electric power where extreme fire conditions are occurring. This isn't without risk, of course, and will involve very close coordination with our communities.","Third, on a longer-term basis, we're working to harden the electric system and integrate new technology. This means we'll be investing in stronger power lines, with conductors that are more resistant to vegetation, and we'll be replacing wood poles with non-wood poles in the highest fire threat areas. As we look down the road, we'll be working closely with our communities to explore how we can expand the use of microgrids to help improve both reliability as well as resilience in the event of a major natural disaster. Our plan includes partnering with our communities to establish energy resilience zones such as at designated hospitals and schools to provide support in the event of a widespread outage.","As an example, in Humboldt County, we've already partnered with members of the communities to integrate a microgrid into a designated Red Cross evacuation center. These energy-resilient zones will provide support not only in response to wildfire threats, but also other natural disasters including earthquakes.","Finally, we also appreciate the CPUC's recognition that climate change is an issue that is incredibly impactful to our business. In fact, they recently an Order Instituting Rulemaking that aims to move beyond just climate change prevention and to integrate adaptation into relevant proceedings at the Commission. This couldn't be more timely, and we look forward to partnering with them on this important work over the course of the next year.","As I think about this effort of the Commission, as well as the execution of our own Community Wildfire Safety Program, there is a natural tie to risk management. The muscle we have built in the last several years to proactively measure and mitigate risk has been instrumental as we've developed this program.","Last fall, we filed our Risk Assessment Mitigation Phase or RAMP for our 2020 General Rate Case filing. The purpose of the RAMP filing is to demonstrate that energy utilities are placing the safety of both the public and their workforce as a top priority in General Rate Case proceedings. Last month, the CPUC Safety Enforcement Division or SED issued a comprehensive report on our plan as reflected in the filing.","We appreciate their positive feedback on several aspects of our plan, as well as their suggestions on how to make it even better over time. SED specifically recognized our work to address climate resilience from both a mitigation and adaptation perspective. They also highlighted our collaborative approach and the level of engagement as we developed our risk models.","Additionally, they classified our quantitative modeling techniques as state of the art. In this time of increased risk, as we face greater threats from climate change, I'm pleased with the progress we've made. And as SED also noted, we have raised the bar for future RAMP filings. I would like to transition now to some additional operational updates as we continue to make steady progress across our business in a variety of areas.","First, I'm happy to share that nearly 80% of the electricity delivered to our customers in 2017 was carbon free with one third coming from qualified renewables. But we know that more can be done and we continue to see opportunities to partner with the state on achieving further carbon reductions. To that point, we believe transportation is the next sector of the economy to tackle.","If you include the fossil fuel refining process, transportation accounts for 50% of greenhouse gas emissions in the state. Simply put, California cannot achieve its greenhouse gas reduction goals if we don't tackle transportation, which is why the Governor recently announced a goal of getting 5 million zero-emission vehicles on California roads by the year 2030.","Right now, we've got about 350,000 in the state, less than a tenth of that target. The potential growth curve is tremendous. And we must think about how we can do things differently to hit that objective. We're positioning ourselves to play a significant role by investing in the infrastructure necessary to enable EV adoption and address consumer range anxiety.","Energy companies like ours are uniquely positioned to help lower barriers to EV adoption. We can build public charging infrastructure, design rates that reduce the cost of charging, administer rebates, educate customers, and spur EV manufacturers to increase production through our own fleet purchases. PG&E is engaged on all these fronts.","We were pleased with most elements of the recent proposed decision that will allow us to move forward with our plans to deploy charging stations for medium and heavy-duty vehicles and we continue to make strong progress on our program to install 7,500 chargers for light duty vehicles which is by the way, the largest approved investor-owned public charging program in the country.","Combined, we will be spending several hundred million dollars in the coming years as we begin to build out the charging grid of the future. This is a period of dynamic change for our industry and we continue to push the envelope to meet the evolving needs of our customers and our communities. Another area where we continue to see change is, of course, in the growth of Community Choice Aggregators or CCAs.","California law requires that customers have a choice of energy providers. As some communities opt to procure their own energy from third parties, a portion of the cost of the energy that PG&E procured on their behalf is falling to our remaining bundled customers. Right now, when a community opts to take energy from another provider, the customers that depart only pay roughly 65% of the cost that we procured on their behalf.","That leaves our bundled customers to bear the remaining 35% in addition to their own share. While we support customer choice, their cost allocation must be addressed in accordance with the law. To that end, we, along with Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric, proposed a new mechanism to allocate these costs. Our proposal was intended to ensure parity for all of our customers. Ultimately, if it's not affordable, it's not sustainable. And revising the cost allocation rules for CCA customers is key to our affordability efforts.","In summary, while we navigate the challenges posed by climate change, we also continue our efforts to support California's place as a global clean energy leader. PG&E has a long history of effective coalition building and partnering on complex issues to help move California forward. And I'm optimistic that we, as a state, can come up with the solutions needed to continue our progress.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jason.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Thank you, Geisha, and good morning, everyone. Before I cover our results for the quarter, I'd first like to address our 2018 guidance. Given the continued uncertainty related to the 2017 Northern California wildfires, we will not be providing 2018 earnings per share guidance on today's call. And as I shared previously, we will revisit this as we have better clarity with the potential liabilities related to the 2017 Northern California wildfires.","Consistent with last quarter, we will be providing guidance on 2018 items impacting comparability, CapEx and rate base for both 2018 and 2019. I want to emphasize that our guidance for these items assumes no additional impact from the Northern California wildfires beyond what we're providing on today's call. This morning, I'll be covering our first quarter results as well as an update on the estimated impacts from tax reform.","Slide 6 shows our results for the first quarter.","Earnings from operations came in at $0.91. GAAP earnings including the items impacting comparability were also shown here. Costs associated with the Northern California wildfires totaled $21 million pre-tax and primarily reflect legal costs. Pipeline related expenses were $10 million pre-tax for the quarter.","We also recorded legal expenses for the Butte Fire, net of insurance recoveries from our contractor of $5 million pre-tax. Moving on, slide 7 shows a quarter-over-quarter comparison from earnings from operations of a $1.06 in the first quarter of last year and $0.91 this year. We were $0.08 favorable due to growth in rate base earnings.","$0.02 of this increase simply reflects the timing of the 2017 GRC decision, which didn't allow recognition of the incremental authorized revenues until the second quarter of 2017. We'll see this small timing differential burst next quarter. With the incremental rate base, we're recording as a result of tax reform, we expect earnings from our rate base growth to be roughly $0.25 for the full year, slightly higher than 2017.","Moving on in the first quarter of last year, we incurred incremental capital cost such as depreciation and interest without offsetting revenues also due to the timing of the 2017 GRC decision. This is driving a $0.03 favorable variance in the first quarter of this year which will reverse next quarter. We were $0.08 unfavorable due to the tax impact from share-based compensation in 2017.","We recorded a $0.06 benefit due to favorable performance in our long-term incentive plan in the prior year. Conversely, with lower performance in 2017, we recorded a tax expense of $0.02 in the first quarter of 2018. We also had a nuclear refueling outage this quarter that contributed $0.06 unfavorable quarter-over-quarter. In 2017, our refueling outage was in the second quarter. Timing of taxes was $0.05 unfavorable. Consistent with previous quarters, our taxes fluctuate with the variability in earnings throughout the year, but ultimately will net to zero for the full year.","Following the settlement in our cost to capital proceeding last year, we are seeing a $0.01 unfavorable variance due to the decrease in our authorized return on equity. We expect this to equal roughly $0.05 on an annualized basis. Share dilution resulted in a $0.01 unfavorable. And finally, miscellaneous items accounted for $0.05 unfavorable. This includes a number of timing-related items as well as in charge this quarter related to environmental obligations at a former electric generating site, which we've just begun remediation work on.","Moving on to slide 8. Our assumptions for 2018 are largely unchanged from what we shared last quarter with the exception of a shift in rate base, which I'll cover shortly. While we're not providing earnings per share guidance for 2018, on an earnings from operations basis, our objective is to earn our CPUC authorized 10.25% return on equity across the enterprise.","Slide 9 shows our forecasted items impacting comparability. These are consistent to what we shared on our fourth quarter call. As a reminder, our range for Northern California wildfire related costs, net of insurance, excludes any potential impacts related to claims.","On slide 10, we provided a few updates to the expected impacts from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. At the end of March, we filed a proposed implementation plan for the CPUC to incorporate the impacts of tax reform and customer rates. As we work through the details, we identified adjustments to the preliminary estimates that we had shared on our fourth quarter call that I'll cover briefly.","First, we anticipate a slightly lower initial annual benefit to customers. We had previously estimated that the annual revenue reduction would be approximately $500 million that we now expect it to be roughly $450 million. This difference is timing related and is expected to eventually flow back to customers in future periods.","Second, while we still anticipate rate base growth to be higher by approximately $800 million by 2019, roughly $200 million that we previously expected to be added in 2018 has now shifted to 2019. This was driven by several factors such as a slightly longer amortization period for certain excess deferred taxes.","Third, while our cumulative financing needs of about $400 million remain unchanged over the next two years as a result of tax reform, we've asked the CPUC for flexibility in the timing of when we implement these adjustments in rates. As a result, our financing needs may be more heavily weighted towards 2019.","Finally, our guidance reflects best expectations today. But ultimately the CPUC and FERC will need to review our proposal and authorize how and when tax reform impacts are implemented. With that said, as I shared last quarter, tax reform is going to provide long-term benefits to our customers and also drive higher rate base growth, financing needs and earnings. We look forward to working with the CPUC and FERC on an implementation plan that benefits all parties.","Slides 11 and 12 show our expected CapEx and rate base for both 2018 and 2019. Our capital expenditure plans through 2019 are unchanged from what we shared last quarter, with planned spend of approximately $6.3 billion in 2018 and roughly $6 billion in 2019. Our rate base forecast also remains consistent with what we shared last quarter, with the exception of the $200 million shift in incremental rate base related to tax reform from 2018 to 2019. Rate base growth is expected to be roughly 7.5% to 8% annually from 2017 through 2019.","Slide 13 shows how we're thinking about uses and sources of equity in 2018 and 2019. In 2017, we had shared that we expected our equity needs for 2018 and 2019 to be largely met through our internal programs, which have generated approximately $300 to $400 million annually over the last several years.","However, with our dividend suspended, the dividend reinvestment program has been halted, so we expect a decrease in the amount of equity these programs will generate. The dividend reinvestment program has historically provided about $60 million annually.","Additionally, through the first quarter, our internal programs have generated equity of roughly $35 million, while investment activity can vary throughout the year, our internal programs may not generate the same levels of equity that we've seen in recent years.","The other factors that we've outlined here are largely unchanged from last quarter. The cash that we're conserving from the dividend suspension continues to provide an equity cushion that could be used to provide needed equity including for any potential liabilities that results from the Northern California wildfires.","In closing, I want to reiterate what Geisha said. We're actively working to address inverse condemnation policy while executing operational plans that provide for improved climate resiliency. And the board remains committed to revisiting the dividend decision as greater clarity is reached with regard to potential liability stemming from the 2017 Northern California wildfires. Finally, as I've shared with you before, we'll keep you apprised of the progress as material facts unfold.","With that, let's open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, good morning.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Good morning, Stephen.","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Good morning.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Geisha, you mentioned in your prepared remarks the need to directly address inverse condemnation. I think the investor community very much understands the seriousness of that issue. Without speaking for the Legislature, but just broadly, is that well appreciated at the Legislature? Is it your sense that that's \u2013 it's understood that that is a very significant issue and needs to be addressed? Is there a broad understanding, or is there still more education to be done on that?","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Thanks for the question, Steve. Let me just start by saying what we've been doing. We've been spending a great deal of time educating a lot of the different stakeholders in the state on how truly flawed the application of inverse condemnation is to investor-owned utilities. And I do believe that that message is resonating and is well understood. And that's why we were so encouraged to see the Governor and the bipartisan leaders come out in March announcing their intention to develop comprehensive solutions this year to really address the climate change issues and how they impact California.","And of course, we were particularly encouraged to see the liability rules and regulations for utility service actually called out as an area requiring updating. So, we've shared many times with all of you and of course, all the various stakeholders, inverse condemnation is a risk to the financial health of all the California IOUs, and by extension, to the state's ability to meet its clean energy goals. So that's why we're so focused on it. It's such an important issue, and I do believe that that message is resonating and is well understood.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Just on fire insurance and just availability and cost. Jason, I just wanted to check in with you and just hear your latest thoughts on market conditions were actually being able to obtain fire insurance?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Thanks, Stephen. Just as a quick reminder, our liability insurance period runs from August 1 through July 31.","And so last year when we renewed, we saw increases in prices but roughly at a level that was nearly 3 times what we're collecting in rates. And, as you can imagine as we're in the market for renewal this year, we're seeing capacity decline and pricing increase. I don't think it wouldn't be prudent for me to comment directly on pricing, but I think that general trend of smaller capacity, declining capacity as well as increasing pricing is something that we're going to face with this new upcoming renewal period.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. And if I could just maybe one last question just on, I guess, I'm thinking about accounting charges for potential fire liabilities. And assuming that we've received the first real data point from Cal Fire in terms of causation, is simply a report on causation enough for you all to think about taking a charge for fire liability, or would you want to see more in terms of \u2013 from the enforcement division, for example, report from them or just further data points for considering the accounting charge?","And perhaps, though, more broadly, I'm questioning how relevant the accounting charge is in terms of the timing for the need of, if at all to raise additional equity. I know that's kind of a long question, just sort of I'm trying to think about what would sort of spur a potential accounting charge, and what might result in the need to raise capital, or is that pretty far off in time?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Yeah. Thank you.There's a lot there. But let me say that I think the Cal Fire reports are going to be an important milestone as it relates to the evaluation of whether an accounting charge is needed. But those Cal Fire reports are not going to be necessarily absolutely dispositive. We will take into consideration what is producing those reports as well as other factors that we've gathered as we've conducted our own fact finding work as well. So, while an important milestone, it is not an absolute conclusion that an accounting charge will be recognized.","In terms of the second part of the question relating to equity needs, I think it's an important reminder that if we were to take a charge, that charge would be noncash. And so, a way to think about the equity needs associated with a noncash charge, it would essentially be about 36% of the pre-tax charge. We'd have to \u2013 the way that calculation works is essentially \u2013 charges would be tax deductible.","Our statutory rate is about 28%. So, on an after-tax charge would be about 72% of the pre-tax charge. And at the time that we would take a noncash charge, we'd only have to raise about half of that equity need. The remaining 36% would be raised as we actually spend the cash. So, the short of it is, equity needs would materialize over time. They would start when we took the accounting charge and they would conclude as we actually pay the cash out.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very good. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Good morning, Jonathan.","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Good morning.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","A question on since I was planning to ask this, I know the 10-Q just came out and it might be answered in there but if it is, I haven't seen it. So, I'm just curious on the Butte Fire. The past two quarters you haven't taken additional charges but you've said you didn't know \u2013 you haven't been able to estimate the high end. At one point, it was because you didn't have information on the claims, but that's like two quarters ago now.","So, can you give us any perspective on sort of how the settlement of those cases is going along, how it's trended relative to what you booked, whether there's anything to read into you not having taken incremental charges, et cetera?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Jonathan, we are about halfway through sort of a settlement of claims associated with Butte. And to your point, we saw a large influx of claims in September of last year. We're still working through the details of some of those claims that came in late, as well as we are working through the impact of our legal challenges with respect to inverse condemnation in the Butte case. So as of the first quarter, we have not modified or provided a high end of that range. It's still $1.1 billion.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, are you still saying that you can't estimate the high end, or is there \u2013 is the inference that it's possible that numbers \u2013 what you booked is the high-end?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","At this point, we still cannot estimate the high-end of the range, but I think that there are a number of factors that are having an impact on settlement values, and we need more time to understand how those long-term trends will play out as we resolve the remaining sort of 50% of the claims.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then just sticking on Butte, I believe the judge decided not to certify his denial of your motion to the appellate court. Does that have much of a bearing in your legal team's view of how long an appeals process might take?","John R. Simon - PG&E Corp.","Hi, Jonathan, it's John Simon, the General Counsel. I \u2013 not materially. So, as you were saying, the judge at our request could have certified his Butte ruling on appeal. He chose not to and when he said that \u2013 when he issued his ruling, he said there were two factors in that. One is that if there are significant disagreements about substantive law that might militate for certification. And he said there were significant disagreements.","But the second factor is would certification materially advance the timing of the litigation and he felt that certification would not. So, he denied the certification. Certification might have some moderate impact on whether the Court of Appeals takes the writ on appeal. But there's cases where certifications are granted by the trial judge and the Court of Appeals doesn't take the appeal and vice versa. So, it really could go either way on the writ at this point.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just sticking on the legal. I have one other thing. If I'm not wrong, the sort of form of the motion that you filed in the North Bay case in San Francisco is sort of \u2013 is different from the type of motion that was filed in the Butte Fire case. Can you, for us non-lawyers, explain, what the \u2013 if that has any bearing on sort of how that's likely to play out just procedurally?","John R. Simon - PG&E Corp.","I'll do my best for the non-lawyers. Bottom line is we don't think it makes a material difference on how it plays out. You're right that procedural vehicles of the motions in Butte and the North Bay cases are different but they're substantively the exact same arguments, which is inverse ought not to be applied to investor-owned utilities for many of the reasons that Geisha mentioned. The difference in the procedures really has to do with the difference in the vintage of those two cases. So as you know, the Butte cases have been on file for going on several years now. The North Bay cases are brand new. And as soon as the first opportunity for us to attack inverse after the Commission issued its WEMA decision, we brought those motions. So, the difference again is the vehicle had more to do with where the cases were in their lifecycles substantively they're the same.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's probably enough for me. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi. Can you hear me?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Yep.","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Yep.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay great. So first question, just on the Legislature. So, I get that there has been very strong high-level support to address fire issues including utility liability in this session. But maybe to go into more detail on that, if you listen to the legislative hearings, there does seem to be the difference in willingness to address things like pre-prudence in the future relative to actually fixing inverse i.e. there's a lot more openness to pre-prudence than picking inverse. So, could you be more specific in addressing Legislation with respect to the chance that fixing inverse will actually be part of it relative to some of these other utility liability fixes.","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Yes, Steve. This is Geisha. We view fixes that need to occur in the state Legislature as being threefold and they're broad in nature. So first, we have three specific goals.","First, there's a need to reform strict liability. And it's simply not sustainable to put all the states' utilities whether they'd be investor-owned or publicly-owned at that level of risk when these wildfires are occurring, particularly when they haven't violated any safety rules or regulations. So, the first order of business is we need a reform on strict liability as it applies to utilities.","The second issue that we need a solution on is the 17 wildfires which impacted both Northern and Southern California. And then the third significant issue that we need movement on is looking at the standard that establishes the legal baseline of reasonableness. And that's really part of what is the prudent manager of the system. We believe that all three of those elements need to be addressed to get the comprehensive reform needed on utility liability.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And is there any way you could give a sense of just how much willingness there is to move beyond just that third one into the first two?","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Yes. So, it's early days. We still have four months left in the session. There are many conversations and dialogue going on with the various stakeholders. The legislative session is, I've mentioned before, it's not linear, it's a highly fluid sort of process. You're going to see different bills, I believe. You're going to see different amendments. I would really caution everyone not to get over-fixated on any one particular piece of legislation, as I do believe we're going to see many different bills, many different amendments, and there's going to be a lot of ups and downs during those process. So, conversations are occurring, lots of discussions are occurring, and it's just a question now of putting the right text on paper to figure out what is the right comprehensive solution for the state?","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then a separate question on the \u2013 there was a Bloomberg story last night where President Picker mentioned that he expected the Cal Fire reports this summer. And I'm just curious if there \u2013 if I'm not sure where that reference came from. But just have you gotten any indications on a timing update for the Cal Fire report?","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","No. We haven't gotten any timing updates from Cal Fire. Maybe he's, I don't know, doing the math and thinking through the comments of the Cal Fire Chief back in January. I think it was Ken Pimlott, at a hearing in Santa Rosa. He talked about reports, many reports, individual reports coming out in the next few months and perhaps President Picker is making an assumption there that those are ready sometime this summer. But, no certainly we haven't gotten any indication of when the timing for those reports will be.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Please proceed.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..","Thanks so much. Hi, guys.","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Good morning.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Good morning, Praful.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..","Morning. So, just on this Cal Fire report, just wanted to understand given we don't know timing. But if it does happen before the assumed solution on the legislative side, how do you see that impacting the legislative process? As in if it is come out saying there is some sort of causation connecting the utilities, do you think that hampers the process and do you think the legislators wait to see that before they do something?","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Praful, this is Geisha. We don't know is really the honest answer here. There are going to be multiple reports. We know that there were 21 fires. The reality is we don't know what kind of impact the actual reports themselves will have on the legislative leaders as they consider utility liability both in the short and the long-term. It's a great question. I have the same question but I don't have an answer for you.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..","Fair enough. No, it's one that troubles me as well so just want to check. Moving on, I know Jason you mentioned that the settlement amounts are coming down from the Butte settlement. So just want to get a sense firstly of where do you think those ranges are going? And you mentioned there are a number of drivers that were helping bring those settlement amounts down. So, would like to get some color on what those drivers are, you think?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Thanks, Praful, for the question. As you can imagine any settlement negotiation is very fluid. The reason why we are unable to provide a high end of the range is we really need to understand a longer-term impact that the various legal challenges we have to inverse condemnation, what those will do to the underlying settlement values. And so, I think providing a specific range today just probably wouldn't be productive.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..","Yeah. No. I totally understand on the number but in terms of like drivers, is there any drivers that you would say would help your story in terms of helping reduce those settlement amounts further?","John R. Simon - PG&E Corp.","I think, Praful, John Simon. I think the earlier slide talked about the number of claimants or plaintiffs in the Butte cases, you've got more than 3,000 plaintiffs. Every single one is a bit different so you can imagine that when you're talking settlement or mediation, you're talking about very unique facts that have to do with each case, and then you overlay on that the uncertainties around inverse and we believe as again Geisha said, that inverse will be decided at some point in an appeals court and we take that into account. Some of the more severe claims tended to be brought up front. You can imagine why that would be. So, it's a whole lot of different things and it's hard to come up with sort of any sort of there is no algorithm on it.","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","And how about the statute of limitations, the fact, that that is another determinant.","John R. Simon - PG&E Corp.","So, Geisha mentioning the statute of limitations, that's a good point. So there's two statute of limitations that are at play in the Butte case, one is for personal injury, and that's a two-year statute of limitations, and that ran in September of 2017. And right before that ran or expired, we saw a fairly big spike in claims. I think we had something like 700 to 900 or so more claims filed. The second statute of limitations in play is on property damage. That expires three years after the fire. So that's September 2018, and it's certainly possible if that past this prologue, that we'll get and more claims filed before that run. So that's another factor.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..","Got you. Super helpful, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please proceed.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Good morning, Julien.","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. If we can, can I come back to this insurance question just real quickly? A couple of pieces of nuance there. So, I know we're early on and it's a little bit difficult to talk about, but how do you think about mitigating the impact from an earnings perspective of the higher insurance premiums, just you talked about bringing down the total volume. I mean I know you're not providing guidance, but how do you think about that sort of in the back half of the year as these new policies take effect over the next quarter or so? And could we see efforts for full recovery? And I'll leave it there.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Yeah. There's a couple of ways we're trying to manage the cost. As we thought about our financial plan for 2018, we understood that pricing for insurance was going to go up. And it was one of the reasons why we're continuing our focus to keep our service affordable for our customers, driving efficiencies throughout our business. And so, it was one of the headwinds that helped shape our efficiency targets for the year, which are essentially probably on an order of magnitude basis similar to what we announced last year.","The other thing that I'll mention is, we do have the opportunity to seek cost recovery. Currently, we have filed in our WEMA application, the ability to recover excessive insurance premiums. That application is pending before the Commission. And finally, the other tool that we have available if WEMA application is denied, it's a Z-Factor filing, which essentially allows us to recover costs that could not be contemplated in our original forecasts that were included in our rate cases. So, we have a couple of tools available to try to mitigate sort of the ongoing risk of an earnings drag from these higher insurance costs.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. But just from a timing perspective given the WEMA application out there, so how do you think we should be thinking through even a transient impact here?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","So, I think as it relates to 2018, in my prepared remarks I mentioned that our financial plan for the year on an earnings from operations basis not a per share basis but on an earnings from operations basis, it's our plan to earn our CPUC authorized return on equity. So, we are contemplating higher insurance costs for the latter part of the year. The challenge that we're confronted with is the longer-term impact of these elevated insurance costs. Probably more in 2019 and 2020 and beyond.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. But the implication, sorry, the implementation of the WEMA filing and the timeline there just to kind of reconcile with that 2019 impact.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","In terms of the WEMA application it's been filed. We are just essentially awaiting a proposed decision in that case. I don't think we have a timeline for that proposed decision. But we're currently awaiting that PDs that we have better clarity after that potential recovery path.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Excellent. And then if I could cut back, I know we're talking about several different cases. But if you could perhaps spread a little bit of a road map of upcoming data points. I know you've attempted to do so. A little bit in the slide deck here but what subsequent court cases should we be paying attention to that could really be the sort of these critical \u2013 addressing these critical milestones. Sort of from a more chronological perspective here rather than talking about the individual case merits.","John R. Simon - PG&E Corp.","I think the next \u2013 Julien, it's John that the next milestone would be and we're prepared and ready to file our appeal of the Butte decision that came out last week relatively soon. So, that's the next milestone. And once we do that then we're asking for the Court of Appeals in the 3rd District here in California to take that appeal.","There's not an exact rule on when they will decide whether or not to take that appeal. But I think it's fair to say that's usually within a couple of months, maybe a little bit shorter. If they take the appeal then the appeal process on that motion goes forward. Separately in the 2017 wildfire cases, we have a motion Geisha alluded to that's pending to dismiss inverse condemnation from all those cases, the hearing for that case is in mid-May. I think it may be May 18 and so that would be the next milestone. Then I think one might look to the litigation involving Edison and motions they may be filing along the same lines. I don't know the timelines with respect to them though.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Turnure of JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Could you guys just give a little bit more detail on that last response there as it pertains to the 2017 wildfire case and the hearing on I guess, May 18? How does the case itself proceed when either you or the plaintiffs end up appealing the initial decision there?","John R. Simon - PG&E Corp.","It's John, Christopher. The case, you should presume the case will go forward if an appeal on an inverse motion is filed. I think it's a fair assumption that an appeal would be filed either by whichever party is disappointed on that ruling. Normally, the case would go forward. Again, I think that's a fair assumption. It is possible for either party to try to stay a case while an appeal is moving forward but that \u2013 all I'm doing there is telling you there is a rule that allows for it. It would be and I wouldn't speculate on whether either party would seek a stay.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Gotcha. Okay. So in the absence of that basically two parallel processes to watch obviously the focus being on the higher court proceeding.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Yes. It's a good way to look at it.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then I also wanted to ask about your catastrophic memorandum account that you filed, I guess, around the same time as your tax reform proposal with the CPUC. Can you give us some color on your decision to use this account to get recovery of past and future spending versus maybe any opportunity you would have had to displace CapEx in your current rate plans and kind of get recovery in that manner? Is it that you're kind of putting a spotlight on these costs and the total amount? Is it that you get a return on the balance while it's being looked at by the Commission, or are there other factors?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Chris. This is Jason. Essentially, the Catastrophic Event Memorandum Account we often refer to as CEMA is the procedural mechanism to recover costs for declared events. So, it really wasn't an analysis of alternative recovery paths or re-prioritizing spend in our General Rate Cases. What it was is essentially an ability for us to recover the costs to restore service and repair our system after declared events. The one nuance to this CEMA application that we recently filed is that we also included a forecast of the elevated vegetation management work that we've been executing in our system, just given sort of the size of those investments, and the delay in recovery periods from previous CEMA events.","So essentially, an average sort of CEMA application generally takes about three years between the time we actually spend the money on our system before we actually start to collect the money in rates. And as we are significantly increasing the amount of work related to vegetation management, we felt that delay in recovery was not in the best interest of our customers which is why we've included a forecast of the vegetation, drought-related vegetation management work in this most recent CEMA application.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And to clarify there, you felt like you did not have an alternative to this like there was no other option that you could use. This was the appropriate account and you used it and then separately, do you get a return on that balance before a decision?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","On the first question in terms of the appropriateness, this is the account that the Commission directs recovery for these types of costs. So, there was really no analysis or decision where we're using the essentially the procedural vehicle that's available to us for recovery of these types of costs. In terms of our ability to recover the balance before it's, before we receive a decision, our balancing accounts do have a short-term financing rate component.","Essentially that we're allowed to recover and as well the capital that we've invested in our system, to restore and repair service, also earns a rate of return during the period which the application is being heard.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks for the detail, Jason.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont of Mizuho Financial Group. Please proceed.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Thanks. I guess first question relates to the timing of the release of the Cal Fire report. I mean as you indicated earlier, it sounded as if the Cal Fire was thinking of releasing within several months if in fact, Picker, was right and it ends up coming out in the summer that would seem to represent a delay. Is there a sense that they want to issue the Nor Cal and the Southern California fire reports at the same time?","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Well. Hi, this is Geisha. No, we haven't heard that. We as a matter of fact have heard that as they finish up their investigations and have their reports ready to go. What we had heard back in January was that there was not going to be a delay in groupings sort of strategy there. So, we have not heard anything different since January. So, our expectation would be that when they're ready as they're ready they would be issued.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Great. And then to-date \u2013 I mean aside from the very general comment that the Governor made earlier in the year. Has the Governor's office may come out specifically on the issue of strict liability or inverse condemnation?","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Just in terms of their statement that utility liability needed to be reviewed, updated actually I think was the word that their statement had and relative to the fact that we're seeing more frequent and more severe issues impacting the state that's the one public statement that I've seen from the Governor's office.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","And I guess the last question that I have is sort of a legal question on the judge's decision in the Butte case. He seemed to indicate that the recovery was in his view not a central tenet of inverse based on a footnote, I guess, and in one of the prior legal decisions issued by the appellate court. Any thoughts on sort of that interpretation of recoverability?","John R. Simon - PG&E Corp.","Paul, it's John. The judge was referring to a footnote in the Pac Bell case that wasn't part of the Pac Bell Holding. And it was really a statement that was trying to distinguish immunities from IOUs. But honestly, that Pac Bell case came out way before the CPUC's recent decision on San Diego's WEMA case where both the Commission and in the concurrences, there was strong language that inverse needs to be reformed. So, no, I can't speak to why the judge included the reference to that footnote, but we think everything's changed, and that footnote really no longer applies on a going forward basis.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Great. Thank you.","Chris Foster - PG&E Corp.","Thank you for that question, Paul. This is Chris. I'll go ahead and close this out. I just want to thank, everyone, again for joining us this morning on the call and for the questions. And have a safe day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This now concludes the conference.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to introduce your hostess, Sara Cherry with PG&E. Thank you, and enjoy your conference. You may proceed, Ms. Cherry.","Sara A. Cherry","Thank you, Lynn. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Before you hear from Tony Earley, Chris Johns and Kent Harvey, I'll remind you that our discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results based on assumptions, forecasts, expectations and information currently available to management.","Some of the important factors that could affect the company's actual financial results are described on the second page of today's slide deck. We also encourage you to review the Form 10-Q that will be filed with the SEC later today, and the discussion of risk factors that appears there and in the 2013 annual report. And with that, I'll hand it over to Tony.","Anthony F. Earley","Thanks, Sara, and good morning, everyone. I'll start off our remarks today and then turn it over to Chris and Kent. I'm going to cover our focus as a company. Chris will discuss the current status of our operations and regulatory and legal matters; and then Kent will conclude with the financial results of the quarter. Let me start with Slide 3.","Since my first day at PG&E, it's been clear to me that everyone here is united around our shared mission to operate a leading utility that delivers safe, reliable and affordable electric and gas service to our customers. Our 3 objectives continue to be resolving the gas issues, positioning the company for long-term success and partnering effectively with others to move the company forward.","So on the gas regulatory front, we continue to await action by the California Public Utilities Commission law judges in the pending gas investigations. But we have not waited to make significant improvements to the safety and reliability of our gas pipeline system. As I've said before, it's vital that the Commission's final decision recognize that we compensated the victims through the civil proceeding and that we made substantial improvements in safety at a very significant cost to our shareholders.","Next resolving the gas rate case. Well, the General Rate Case will allow us to continue the important work we've already begun. We'll be able to upgrade our gas and electric systems and generating assets and continue to grow. As you know, we don't control the schedule, but we expect to receive a proposed decision soon, and we'll look to the Commission to reach a reasonable and timely final decision.","In our gas transmission business, we filed a Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case for 2015. And finally, the U.S. Attorney's indictment of the company under the federal Pipeline Safety Act was a development that we shared in detail earlier this quarter. We just do not believe any employees intentionally violated the federal pipeline safety regulations. And we believe that even where the mistakes were made, employees were acting in good faith.","Turning to operations, in 2014 we continued to see strong progress. As a company, we've been focusing on steps to ensure the safety of our customers. And one area where I'm pleased to see great progress in the first quarter was in the reduction of third-party damages to our gas and electric lines as a result of unsafe digging practices.","With respect to future success, our integrated planning process is now in its third cycle with plans for driving continuous improvement throughout the organization. As we look forward, we continue to focus on superior execution of the work outlined in our rate cases and earning our authorized return this year with the exception of the gas pipeline business. And next year, our objective is still to earn our authorized return for the entire enterprise. So with that, let me turn it over to Chris.","Christopher P. Johns","Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my remarks with an update on our operations and then touch on regulatory developments.","Starting with gas operations, since 2011 we've successfully strength-tested over 675 miles of pipe, replaced almost 130 miles, retrofitted more than 400 miles to allow for inline inspection and installed nearly 150 automated shutoff valves. This work on the pipeline is the most extensive in the United States, and demonstrates the company's commitment to enhance the safety and integrity of our gas system. And this work has not been limited to the gas transmission business. We've taken lessons learned and applied them throughout our operations. We're finding and fixing issues in all areas of our operations, including our gas distribution system.","In our gas distribution system during the first quarter, one of our crews working on a distribution line upgrade accidentally caused a leak, which caused an explosion at a vacant house in Carmel. Fortunately, nobody was injured. We take this event very seriously. The immediate steps we took included modifying our work procedures and hiring an independent third-party engineering firm to conduct a root cause analysis.","The expert firm released their report last week and concluded that the explosion could have been prevented by proper verification of the distribution line status and configuration prior to working on the line. The report recommends a series of safety actions, which we fully embrace and have already implemented or will begin implementing shortly. We know the lessons learned from Carmel will make our operations even stronger and safer going forward.","In the electric business this quarter, we've now fully integrated about 500 new devices on our lines to isolate outages and reroute power automatically in the event of a failure. We've already seen positive results from this program. Just since January 1, we've avoided nearly 10 million customer outage minutes or almost 100,000 sustained customers\u2019 outages. This is just one example of the work we're doing on our electric system to improve the reliability experienced by our customers.","In our energy supply organization, we've successfully completed another refueling outage at Diablo Canyon. As is true every 5 years, 2014 includes scheduled refueling outages on both units at the plant, with the second outage coming in the fall.","Turning to regulatory matters, I'll spend a few minutes on our 3 pending rate proceedings. The first is our 2014 General Rate Case, where we are awaiting a proposed decision. This rate case integrates a strong risk prioritization process and a focus on safety. The Commission's consultants reviewed our request from a safety perspective. The consultants' reports provided some constructive comments, but also recognized the overall improvements we're making, including our integrated planning process that Tony talked about and risk management assessments as well as safety improvements.","We look to the administrative law judge overseeing the GRC, and ultimately to the Commission, to acknowledge the importance of our plans to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution systems and generation assets. As a reminder, once the CPUC issues a final decision, the revenue requirement change will be retroactive to the first of the year.","The second case was the Gas Transmission Rate Case, which we filed in December. During the quarter, we filed a motion with the Commission to request that the revenue requirement for the Gas Transmission Rate Case be retroactive to January 1, 2015, even though the final decision will come later. We're pleased to have partnered with TURN and ORA to gain support for this important motion in the proceedings. We expect a ruling on the motion in the next 2 months.","Finally, with TO15, our electric transmission rate case, we continue to engage with the other parties for settlement discussions in April, and we'll continue those conversations later this month. With that, I'll turn it over to Kent.","Kent M. Harvey","Thanks, Chris, and good morning. I'll now walk through the results for the first quarter, which are summarized on Slide 5. You can see that earnings from operations were $0.54. GAAP results, reflecting the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters, were $0.49.","The table at the bottom has the natural gas item in pre-tax dollars. And you can see the pipeline-related expenses came in at $40 million for the quarter. Keep in mind that work on the pipeline is seasonal. We plan less work during the winter months, and we do expect it to pick up significantly in future quarters.","Slide 6 shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations and the main drivers behind the $0.09 difference. About $0.04 of it is due to the fact that without a decision in our pending General Rate Case, we're not recovering the increase in depreciation and interest expense resulting from capital growth over the past year. After the Commission approves the General Rate Case, which will be retroactive to January 1, we'd expect to recover these costs. And for that matter, turn a return on a larger authorized rate base. So this one's essentially a timing issue.","Another $0.03 is due to the increase in shares outstanding, and the rest is due to a number of smaller items, some of which are also just timing. So that's the summary of our first quarter results.","As you know, we are not providing -- we've not provided guidance for earnings from operations for the year, given the pending General Rate Case and the gas investigations at the PUC. However, on our last call, we did provide some key inputs to assist you in developing estimates, such as ranges for CapEx, rate base, unrecovered gas cost and equity issuance. We've not made any revisions to that information since last quarter, and it's included in today's presentation.","On Slide 7, you'll see the estimated range for our item impacting comparability for natural gas matters remains at $350 million to $450 million pre-tax. At the bottom is the reminder that these figures exclude future insurance recoveries, which obviously would net against these costs and exclude any additional fines or penalties resulting from the gas investigations that haven't already been accrued.","Finally, during Q1, we issued a little over $300 million of common stock, and we continue to target between $800 million and $1 billion of issuance for the year. Keep in mind that, that range excludes any additional fines or penalties resulting from the gas investigations, which will be incremental to the range we've provided.","And with that, we'll go ahead and open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Just -- you mentioned that the Carmel independent report was out last week, has there been any reaction to that from other constituent policymakers?","Christopher P. Johns","Steve, this is Chris. We have not heard anything, and we haven't seen any reactions to it. I mean, we've been aggressive about sharing it with the different policymakers and constituencies. So there hasn't been any reactions publicly yet.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And then just the $300 million of stock you've issued so far to date, how much of that -- do you know how much of that came out of your dribble versus your comp programs?","Kent M. Harvey","Yes, I've got the number here, Steve. The majority was out of the dribble. Our internal programs, I think, were in the $80 million range and the remainder was from the dribble.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And the obvious question, just are you getting any indication from anyone on timing of when you'll get an ALJ on the San Bruno issues?","Anthony F. Earley","This is Tony. No, we still believe that as we approach midyear, we should get it. But obviously we don't control that, and we're just waiting. But we continue to focus on moving ahead and getting work done. Because our belief is the more work we get done, the more we close out all of our gas issues, the better off we are.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I'm just thinking about timing for this year with the GRC waiting on the PD and then formalization. Can you remind me what the time distance or what would be the normal process once you have the PD to once you have a final order in the GRC, just so we can try and figure out if how much time we have left in this quarter before all the catch-up money goes into the third quarter -- or whenever that shows up?","Thomas E. Bottorff","Yes. This is Tom Bottorff. I'm responsible for regulatory affairs. So what we expect once the PD is issued, parties will have 20 days to comment, then there will be another 5 days for reply. So the earliest you can get a final decision is 30 days, roughly, after the PD was issued. But sometimes decisions can change or other issues can come up that cause delay. But the earliest could be 30 days and it could be another month or 2 after that.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So basically, if we don't have something in the next couple of weeks, then we should assume that it's going to be at best case third quarter pickup from an earnings perspective?","Thomas E. Bottorff","Yes, I think that's reasonable.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on the criminal case, as it stands out right now, there's been more talk of maybe going after some of these past profits rather than the per violation costs. Can you remind us again where your legal position is on that point? And then, is this something do you think there's an opportunity to settle on or resolve or does this have to go through the court process?","Anthony F. Earley","Let me start off and then, Hyun Park, our General Counsel, could go into a little bit more detail. But there has been considerable confusion in the press about these alternative fines following the arraignment last month. So I just want to make it clear that the indictment documents do not include any request for alternative fines. And talking to our lawyers, we strongly believe that the law says that in order to seek alternative fines at this point, the prosecutors would need to go back to the grand jury, file a new superseding indictment that specifically seeks alternative fine. Whether they do that or not, we don't know whether they're going to do that, but none of it changes the underlying reality that fundamentally, it's our belief that the criminal charges against the company just are not merited. Hyun, I don't know whether you want to say any more about the -- procedurally what...","Hyun Park","Yes, Dan, this is Hyun Park, General Counsel. And I guess the point that I want to make is that there are actually pretty high hurdles to seek an alternative fine. So what the government would have to do is, in addition to filing a brand new superseding indictment, we believe that they would have to prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the criminal conduct occurred and that the specific conduct actually caused the loss or the gain that they're going to base the alternative fine on, and that they have to also prove beyond a reasonable doubt the amount of the loss or gain. They also have to convince the court that the alternative fine would not unduly complicate or prolong the sentencing process. So they have to jump through lot of hoops for that.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Do you see, given that -- given otherwise the comparable -- these smaller dollars relative to anything else you guys have gone through, is there an opportunity here to settle this and just get it off the plate?","Anthony F. Earley","Well, we are always open to settlement on this, and we'll continue to look for opportunities going forward. I think procedurally right now that the time isn't right for that. But as we get through the initial phase of this proceeding, we will look for those opportunities. Because you're right, the dollar figures are not big issues here.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And I guess just one last question, Tony. You focused a lot on trying to improve the operating performance from third and fourth quartile performance up to higher levels. Can you just give us an update where some of those bigger measures stand, and maybe when we should expect to see good comparability for what you guys did last year relative to the industry?","Anthony F. Earley","Sure, I'll start off and Chris can add some things. You're exactly right. I think 2.5 years ago when I got here, I characterized that we were solidly in the third and fourth quartile for a lot of our key metrics. And I'm really pleased to say that we're pushing up. We moved some of the metrics into first quartile. Even some of the more challenging ones are starting to push up to the median, which will push them from third to the second quartile. Chris mentioned electric reliability. We've had a string of -- we're looking at probably the fifth year in a row this year where we will have record performance on the electric side of the business. Nick Stavropoulos and his team have really transformed the gas business from a solid fourth quartile company to one that's got some really positive things going on. And maybe Chris or Nick can comment on some of the progress we've made.","Christopher P. Johns","Yes, Tony. This is Chris. And what I would say is, is that we've focused on a lot of the different areas. We've talked about reliability on the electric side having five-year -- 4 years now and getting into a fifth year of setting new records for us that will get us into the second quartile nationally. In addition on the electric side, we've been able to offset inflation in that organization last year. And we've embedded that into the rate case because of the continuous improvement programs. I think that's really the key. All of the organizations have embedded continuous improvement programs and initiatives within the organization that is helping them drive out cost and be able to do things like start to offset inflation and some of the other pressures that we've had.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS.","Michael Weinstein","I just wanted to confirm the -- when you're saying that there'll be some recovery once the retroactive nature of the GRC falls in, are you talking about the $0.04 there in the waterfall chart?","Kent M. Harvey","Yes, this is Kent. So what's happened is in the past year, since the first quarter of last year, obviously we've had another year of CapEx and a rate base as [ph] well [ph]. So we have been incurring, in the first quarter, a higher level of depreciation and our interest expense is higher. Once we get the General Rate Case, we expect that it will provide revenues that will cover those costs, as well as the fact that we will have an authorized rate base that will be higher, and we'll be able to earn a return on a higher authorized rate base. So you should see both the $0.04 recovery in a future period as well as just the return component on a higher level of rate base for 2014 as compared to 2013 in the last rate case.","Michael Weinstein","So just to be clear, you're not delaying any capital spending right now? The capital spending is going on, rate base is increasing, it's just not been recognized as such?","Kent M. Harvey","That's correct. And the key thing is that the PUC's decision, we do expect will be retroactive to January 1. So we will get the revenues for -- that we would have otherwise gotten during the first quarter, they will just be booked in a later period. And there's nothing unusual about that retroactivity. That's kind of the standard way.","Michael Weinstein","Right, right. I just wanted to make sure there wasn't a delay in the spending that you'd have to make up, I guess, later on in the year. But it sounds like...","Kent M. Harvey","No, we've mainly been staying on our plan and our plan on the expense side, for the time being, was to stay relatively flat to last year with the expenses, pending the GRC outcomes. And that's the path we've been on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with CRT Capital.","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Could you just walk us through the -- I'm not an attorney, so can you just walk us through the process with the indictment and what goes on from here? And maybe the expected timing for this whole process?","Hyun Park","Yes, so this is Hyun Park. So right now, there is a status conference that's scheduled for June 2. And I think the judge will at that point decide on some procedural schedules. There will be discovery. There will be motion. There will be additional status conferences. I think it's hard to predict how long the actual trial will take. It's probably 1 year, 2 years, or it could take longer than that. There was a federal indictment in August of 2009 against a utility, and from indictment to the actual jury verdict, it took approximately 22 months. That's an example that's out there.","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. Where is this going to be tried? Is this going to be tried in San Francisco? And if so, do you think you can get a fair trial given all the media coverage of this?","Hyun Park","So we believe the trial will be here in San Francisco, and it's before a U.S. federal district court judge. And we believe that we can get a fair trial. And we'll just have to work through this here in San Francisco.","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","And then the last question is, aside from the penalties that might be considered, is there anything operationally that a conviction could have on the day-to-day operations of the company?","Hyun Park","Yes. So some of the remedies that are available to a judge in sentencing in the event of a conviction is that the judge could order a monitor -- a court-appointed monitor, and there are other reporting type of remedies that the judge could also order as well.","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Nothing would impact your Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity, is that correct? Or shouldn't impact, I should say?","Hyun Park","I assume you're talking about our ability to operate our business?","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Correct.","Hyun Park","Yes -- no.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. Just one question. When you think of the delays, we thought we'd resolved right now, we're waiting for the ALJ in the San Bruno proceeding, yet the company is still spending capital. Do you think the delay helps you when it comes to their proposed decision or final decision that maybe cooler heads are prevailing and the parties are seeing all the investment the company's making? Or you think this delay's going to have no impact at all on the final decision?","Anthony F. Earley","I hesitate to speculate on the impact, but our view is that the more we improve the system, the better off we are. And I think the commissioners recognize that we have transformed the system and have really taken it to a whole new level. And we're doing some things in the gas business that will be industry-leading -- are industry-leading. And we think that will be helpful when they're considering the appropriate penalty. Because not only have we compensated the victims in the civil cases, but we've remedied a lot of the issues that were raised in the NTSB report and elsewhere.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kit Konolige with BGC.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Just -- most of my questions have been answered, one quick question. I think, Tony, you mentioned that you have support from TURN and ORA on the retroactivity concept for the gas transmission case?","Anthony F. Earley","Yes, that's correct, Kit.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","And -- so when should we see a final indication from the Commission that, that would be retroactive? And can you just give us a view of what the timing is for the full case?","Thomas E. Bottorff","Yes, this is Tom Bottorff. With respect to that motion that seeks approval of the settlement between ORA and TURN and our company, that's expected within 1 month or 2. So we should see maybe [indiscernible] within the next month or the month after. The entire case, we do have a schedule that's been issued by the judge and the proceeding, and it calls for a final decision in the first quarter 2015.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It's actually Rajeev Lalwani. First question was just on the -- as to whether or not there's any interaction between the criminal case and the state-level investigation as it relates to penalties, fines so that there's no kind of double counting? I'll ask maybe that and then a follow-up.","Anthony F. Earley","We don't see any interrelationship. They are independent proceedings.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And do you know if there's a dialogue between the 2 or anything like that?","Anthony F. Earley","That we don't know. I mean, I'm sure there have been discussions. We do know that in the course of the U.S. Attorney's investigation, they were looking at a lot of materials that were developed in the PUC case. And I would assume that there have been some discussions, but we really see these as separate proceedings.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Understood. Second question was just more on investment potential longer term. I know you've got a 7% to 11% annual rate base forecast, but any thoughts on whether or not you think that can continue longer term? And then, any thoughts on whether or not earnings could follow that closely?","Kent M. Harvey","Rajeev, this is Kent. I think it's fair to assume that the infrastructure investment we're making at a pretty good clip is not going to be done during the next -- this upcoming general rate case period. So we continue to see a lot of opportunity to invest in our existing system, to upgrade it both for reliability and safety.","Anthony F. Earley","And this is Tony. Let me add, I think, from the general standpoint, we're getting a good consensus of thought leaders around California that a, we need to invest in infrastructure -- not only to remedy some of issues we had in gas, but also to take advantage of new technologies. Chris talked about the fabulous performance improvement in our electric business. And a lot of it's been driven by coupling the technology of smart meters with automated switching devices, and we've only just scratched the surface on using the data that we're developing out of those smart meters. And I think there's a lot of excitement of thought leaders around making sure we continue those investments here in California.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then, Kent, just to follow up on that. As it relates to just earnings growth, do you generally think your rate base growth and earnings growth would be close, or do you expect a big delta just from equity needs, et cetera?","Kent M. Harvey","Well, we haven't provided equity guidance longer term, but I think we have given you guys the tools to come pretty close to estimating it. And we do anticipate that we'll continue to have equity needs. So that will impact what the EPS profile looks like going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I wonder if you could characterize the timing and why it's taking so long, I guess, at the FERC, on the transmission case. And how that might back up your next few transmission cases or affect investment?","Thomas E. Bottorff","Hi. This is Tom Bottorff. If you're addressing TO15, our FERC transmission rate case, it's really not off schedule to any significant degree at this point. Settlement discussions are all ongoing. We would expect to file TO16 in July, so we'll see. But I think there's still a good chance TO15 could be settled prior to that.","Christopher P. Johns","This is Chris. I mean I think that's generally in line with our last several years' worth of TO filings.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, would you expect any impact or any further delays based on FERC -- potential FERC rulings in the Northeast case or the MISO case in terms of ROEs?","Christopher P. Johns","No, we would not.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just want to make sure I kind of catch up a little bit on some of the rate case dockets, the General Rate Case and GT&S one. Can you talk to us a little bit about what won't be recoverable as a result of both cases? Meaning, what will still be kind of a potential drag on traditional rate base math for you even after you get that GT&S order?","Kent M. Harvey","Well, this is Kent. And let me just take the gas transmission stuff. I think, in that case, we have not requested the rights-of-way work, which you know is a 5-year program, 1 year of which is behind us. But we're in the second year of that program. And our estimates for the full 5 years was roughly $500 million. So those dollars would not be recovered, and those will continue in '14, '15, '16 and '17. And then, I would say the other ones, there are 2 smaller pieces that we decided not to seek recovery of in the gas transmission case. And each one of them is roughly $25 million per year for the 3-year rate cycles. One has to do with certain remedial corrosion work, and the other one has to do with hydrostatic testing of post-61 pipe. And those are really the items that we've not sought recovery in the gas transmission case.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And can you help us understand when we think about the combination of your GRC as well as the GT&S cases, what the bridge between the O&M you're requesting and as a result of both cases versus kind of historical levels?","Kent M. Harvey","Well, I guess, the way I would say [ph] it from an earnings perspective, maybe one way you want to think about it is, prior to this year we've been consciously spending about $250 million in excess of what we were recovering in those cases. That's putting aside the gas item impacting comparability. But in our normal operations, about $250 million. And those -- that's essentially the gap from an earnings perspective that we're trying to address in the combination of the 2 rate cases. And obviously the General Rate Case is the bigger piece of that.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And finally, can you rehash for us just what's the level of capital spending under PSEP that we won't be recovering in rates going forward?","Kent M. Harvey","I think that's about $500 million that doesn't get recovered.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Of future capital spend or spend that's already occurred?","Kent M. Harvey","Some of that is spend that's already occurred, but we've accrued the total amount. And the rest of it will occur this year, because the PSEP program reaches its conclusion at the end of 2014.","Operator","There are currently no additional questions waiting from the phone lines.","Sara A. Cherry","Thanks, Lynn. I think we'll wrap it up. Thanks very much, everyone, for participating, and don't hesitate to call us if you have any follow-up questions.

[Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Gabe Togneri, with PG&E. Thank you and enjoy your call. You may proceed, Mr. Togneri.","Gabriel B. Togneri","Thanks, Monique, and good morning, everyone. We certainly appreciate you joining us on our call. Before you hear from Tony Earley, Chris Johns and Kent Harvey, let me remind you that our discussion will include forward-looking statements about future financial results. And those are based on assumptions and expectations reflecting information that's currently available to management. Some of the important factors that could affect the company's results are described in Exhibit 1 located in the Appendix of today's slides, and we certainly encourage you to review that. We also encourage you to review the Form 10-Q that will be filed with the SEC later today and the discussion of risk factors that appears in the 2012 annual report.","And with that, I'll hand it over to Tony.","Anthony F. Earley","Well, good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We're going to keep our prepared remarks fairly brief this morning. We had a solid quarter, consistent with our plans. Our focus continues to be on the areas I've outlined at the beginning of last year: resolving gas issues, positioning the company for long-term success and partnering effectively with stakeholders.","In the various investigations, hearings are complete, and we expect the parties to file briefs on fines and remedies in the next few days. While we remain open to settlement, the most likely path will be completion of the litigation. Even though this is a slower process involving briefings and decisions, we believe the PUC proceedings will be completed this year.","Meanwhile, we're doing extensive work throughout the utility to continue driving toward safe, reliable and affordable electric and gas service for our customers. And I'm pleased with the operational progress we're making. And as Kent will report, our financial performance for the quarter is in line with our plans.","But I'll first turn things over to Chris, who will cover regulatory and operational items in a little more detail. Chris?","Thomas E. Bottorff","Great. Thanks, Tony. So I'll start with the regulatory items and then touch on some of our operating results.","In the gas proceedings, we filed our reply briefs in the record keeping in San Bruno investigations last week. In the briefs, we addressed the violations alleged by the other parties to the cases. We challenged the legal basis of those allegations, which we consider to be flawed. On Monday, the interveners and CPUC staff are scheduled to file their recommendations for fines or other penalties related to the San Bruno accident. We'll have the opportunity to file our formal reply brief later in May. And then following rebuttal briefs from the other parties in early June, the record will be complete in all of the investigations. Then the case will be in the hands of the administrative law judges.","Let me highlight a few other regulatory items. During the first quarter, the CPUC approved the automatic adjustment mechanism for the cost of capital. This mechanism is in place through 2015 and provides good visibility to our authorized return on equity during that period as well as some protection for our customers and shareholders. More recently, the CPUC denied requests for a rehearing on their approval of Oakley. And as a reminder, Oakley is a 586 megawatt next generation gas-fired plant that will be an important resource as we ramp up renewables to 33% of total usage over the next couple of years.","And finally, on the regulatory front, tomorrow, we expect the Division of Ratepayer Advocates to file their testimony responding to our General Rate Case request. Now we have taken approach to the General Rate Case application focused on enhancing the safety of our system utilizing a risk-based process. While we hope that the DRA will also take a different approach to their testimony, they've routinely taken extreme positions in the past.","That brings me over to our operations. Over the past few years, this company has spent more than $1.4 billion in shareholder funds to improve our gas pipeline system as we focus on safety and excellence in operations. We continue to make significant and measurable progress in the first quarter of this year.","You can see on Slide 3 of the planned work, we've completed on pipeline testing, replacement and valve installation since the beginning of the year. We don't do as much work on the pipelines during the first quarter because of higher gas demand during the winter months. So you can expect to see the volume of this work increase as the year progresses.","Also during the first quarter, we closed out 3 recommendations made by the National Transportation Safety Board following the San Bruno accident. At this point, we resolved 7 of the original 12 recommendations. The remaining 5 are longer-term projects that are on target, and the D&T has -- characterizes this as open, but acceptable.","On the rights of way, we've completed more than 1,500 miles of the center line survey, which is on target with our goal for the year thus far. We started the survey in the more rural parts of the system, which means we haven't yet had to deal with remediating many material encroachments. We're still early in the surveying process. And as we move into the Bay Area and other more populated areas this spring, we'll expect to gain additional insights.","Shifting to the electric part of the business. Last quarter, we talked about our record level of electric reliability in 2012. And now during the first quarter, we had our best reliability performance ever as a company. That's not just the best first quarter ever, but the best quarter ever. Although favorable weather was a component, the investments we've been making in upgrading the infrastructure and increasing the use of technology on the system have resulted in improved performance. We know that reliability is a critical component to customer satisfaction, so it's one of the key metrics we're focused on.","And last, at Diablo Canyon, we completed a scheduled refueling outage on Unit 2 in March. This was among the most successful outages in Diablo Canyon's history given the extent of work involved. The team finished the outage in less time than planned and demonstrated exceptional attention to safety.","Based on our benchmarking, we understand what good operations look like, and we will keep reaching for top-level performance throughout our business. You can see how we're doing across a range of top-level metrics for 2013 in Exhibit C of the Appendix.","And with that, I'll turn things over to Kent.","Kent M. Harvey","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everybody. I'm going to start by going through Q1 results, which are summarized on Slide 4.","Earnings from operations for the quarter were $0.63, and our GAAP results were $0.55. Of course, the difference is the item impacting comfortability for natural gas matters, and that's laid out in pretax dollars in the table at the bottom. You'll see the pipeline-related costs totaled $62 million pretax for the quarter. This includes our pipeline safety enhancement planned work, our right-of-way and integrity management work and then our legal costs. We expect the overall run rate to increase the rest of the year since a couple of these components are expected to ramp up. You'll remember that PSEP work is somewhat seasonal and is typically lower in Q1. And in the case of the right-of-way work, we're still ramping up that program. So those costs are also expected to increase in future quarters. You'll also see in the table that there were no additional accruals for penalties, third-party liability claims or insurance recoveries during Q1.","Slide 5 shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations, including the main drivers that take us from $0.89 in Q1 last year to $0.63 in Q1 of this year. The new cost of capital that went into effect this year was the biggest driver of the year-over-year decline, totaling $0.10 negative. In addition to the reduction in ROE, there was a small impact associated with the true-up of our debt financing cost. The refueling outage for Diablo Canyon Unit 2 accounted for $0.06 negative since last year's scheduled refueling outage for Unit 1 was in the second quarter.","Increased shares outstanding resulted in a $0.04 impact, and the timing of our planned incremental expenses across the utility drove a $0.03 decline. Last year, our incremental spending was lower in Q1 since we were ramping up our programs. And this year, we expect a more even spread across the quarters. A number of other items totaled $0.08 negative","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we ask that you can see answer -- remain on the call. The conference will begin momentarily. Again, please continue to remain on the call. The call will remain momentarily.","[Technical Difficulty]","Kent M. Harvey","I'm sorry, this is Kent. I understand that you lost me for a moment. So I'm going to just go back to guidance, and we'll take it from there. And if there are any questions about the quarterly results, we can handle those in Q&A.","So our guidance for the year is unchanged and is summarized on Slide 6. The range for earnings from operations remains at $2.55 to $2.75 per share and some of the key assumptions that underlie our guidance are provided in the Appendix of the slide deck. These assumptions have not changed since we provided them on our last call.","At the bottom of the slide, you can see our guidance for the key components of the natural gas matters item in pretax dollars, and these are also unchanged.","Finally, we continue to expect to need roughly $1 billion to $1.2 billion of equity for the year, excluding any fines or penalties beyond the $200 million we've already accrued. Of that, we issued about $430 million in Q1. This was comprised of a $300 million block issuance, about a $70 million under our 401(k) and dividend reinvestment programs and about $60 million to our continuous equity offering, or dribble program. During Q1, we completed our existing dribble program, and we're ready to file for another $400 million program later on today.","That's it for my remarks. We'll now go ahead and open up the lines for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Tony, in your early comments, you made reference that you're probably going to go the full distance on getting San Bruno done. Can you maybe just give a little context on, have your settlement talks effectively broken down? And is there a concern that once the briefs are out there, people's positions are going to be too far apart to be able to settle?","Anthony F. Earley","Well, as we've said, there have not been active settlement costs for some time, but we continue to indicate we are open to those talks. Obviously, as people have to file briefs, positions become a little more hardened. And that's why I think the most likely outcome, Dan, is that we just continue through the litigation process. And we're getting now towards the end, briefs are getting filed. So we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. We can work our way through the process and certainly get it done this year.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the $1 billion to $1.2 billion of equity, just to make sure I understand that. That number does not assume that there is any sort of fine or penalty so whatever gets settled in this case will have to get addressed toward year end or whenever the case gets resolved. Is that fair?","Kent M. Harvey","Dan, this is Kent. So the $1 billion to $1.2 billion includes the $200 million that we've already accrued. So if a fine were larger than that, then that would be incremental to the $1 billion to $1.2 billion.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, Kent, what I had lost off on the call is when you started talking about the $0.08 of drag from Other. So, I mean, I don't know if everybody else missed that or not. But could you just explain what was in the $0.08 year-over-year drag, and how we should frame that up from a recurring basis?","Kent M. Harvey","Yes, Dan, and sorry about the technical difficulties, and I wasn't sure when you lost me. But the $0.08 was really kind of a number of Other items, and it included things like lower gas transmission revenues. And we really had last year during the first quarter, a little bit higher gas utilization for generation. And then it had other items, including our higher below-the-line costs as well.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So that -- is that the gas storage business and kind of where you make some extra profits, is that what you're referring to from the transmission piece? Or this is just a flow-through number?","Kent M. Harvey","In this case on the gas business, it was more the backbone revenues. And it just was associated with the throughput for gas generation.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then the storage business was -- how was that year-on-year?","Kent M. Harvey","I don't believe that was a major driver quarter-over-quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a quick one on the -- I maybe should know this, but I wanted to clarify. The Centerline survey where you talk about having done the 1,500 miles, is that really the -- linked to the encroachment analysis? Are these the same thing effectively? Or are they separate?","Christopher P. Johns","Jonathan, this is Chris. They're the same thing. The Centerline survey is going through the process of major -- or putting on GPS exactly where the center of the pipe is. And that takes into consideration then our ability to know the encroachment on top of our right-of-ways.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So the 1,500 is out of a total of --","Christopher P. Johns","About 6,700.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, and then I think I heard you say that you've started off in the more -- the less densely-populated areas.","Christopher P. Johns","That's correct. And we're just now starting to get movement towards the more highly-populated areas.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So do you -- that not withstanding, do you have -- do you feel any better about the quality of the estimate now than you did last time?","Christopher P. Johns","Obviously, we haven't changed it. And that's our best estimate at this point in time.","Kent M. Harvey","And Jonathan, I'll just add, we really have not yet gotten in to the Bay area and stuff. We've been out in more remote rural areas. So it's going to be a while, I think, before we have additional insights there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","My question's for Tony. As you think about the way that the pipeline matter's proceedings work their way to a conclusion, does the fact that you now are looking or your opinion that you're now looking at a litigated outcome versus a settlements narrow the potential for the type of decision that you ultimately get from the CPUC, i.e. are they limited in a -- in their decision-making process to just either fining you or not fining you? Or do they have the flexibility to determine the way in which they deem the penalty should be applied, i.e. through reinvesting in the system and getting lower returns or things like that? Or is there just a fundamental -- is there a fundamental difference between the flexibility that can be put to bear in a settlement versus the flexibility that can be put to bear in a final decision?","Anthony F. Earley","Greg, we think with respect to penalties versus disallowances, which would be in the form of requiring us to do work that we wouldn't get recovery of, we think they've got the same kind of flexibility that we have in a settlement. Probably the only difference is those other parties, who in a settlement might be able to get some concessions, are not going to be able to get anything in a litigated decision because the litigated decision will just impact us. But in terms of the big-ticket items of whether it's a fine or whether it's in a form of some sort of disallowance, I think the commission ultimately has all the flexibility that they need.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess, I'm referring to Slide 3. Quick question is, I guess, when I get to the gas investigations, we get fine and remedy recommendations May 6. I think you guys have a couple of weeks before you file, I guess, your rebuttal testimony. Roughly, a timeframe, I would guess when we get an ALJ, I guess, recommendation, do we get 1 or we get 3 separate ones? And then from there, just a rough window of when does the CPUC come out with an order.","Thomas E. Bottorff","This is Tom Bottorff in Regulatory Affairs. The PUC -- the judges are expected to issue a consolidated decision. The uncertainty is whether they issue 2 separate opinions: one on the violations and one on the fines. They could, for example, issue an interim decision on whether or not we violated any rules or regulations and subsequently, issue a decision on the fines; or alternatively, they could just do it all at once. At either event, all 3 investigations will be consolidated in those opinions.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And is there -- I'm just trying to come up with a rough calendar, from when an ALJ recommendation possibly could come. Are they like a 60-day window or something, and then a CPUC decision?","Thomas E. Bottorff","Yes, it's at least 60 days. So we wouldn't expect to see any decision probably until July or August of this year. Again, it depends on whether they choose to do 2 opinions, in which case, the -- an interim opinion on the violations could come as early as July. If they choose to wait and issue a consolidated opinion on both the violations and the fines, you probably wouldn't see anything until mid- to late-August.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then from there, from the ALJ, then it subsequently goes to the CPUC, the commission and that's when you get a final order?","Thomas E. Bottorff","Potentially, the difference in an investigation is the administrative law judges could issue what's called a presiding officer decision. And if no one protests the judge's decision, then it becomes final. However, if there are protests, then it would go to the commission for a final order. And that would add probably, at least, 30 days to any final outcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Tony, one question for you, one for Kent. Just a bigger, broader picture, the fact that you've been unable to settle from the San Bruno-related fines and investigation tied to the OII, do you think there's a read across to the broader regulatory environment and the broader regulatory treatment of PG&E, especially given the fact that there's some other key dockets, like the General Rate Case outstanding? That's kind of the first question. And then, a Kent question. General Rate Cases in California have, over the last 3 or 4 years, gone well beyond the normal 12- or 14-month time horizon. I know the commission is trying to kind of rectify that with your case a little bit. But if your case were to extend similar to the same timeframe that the SoCal Ed and San Diego gas cases have done so, what would that mean for balance sheet and capital needs kind of next year?","Anthony F. Earley","Michael, let me start off. We've asked ourselves that question or ask whether there is spillover. We're fairly confident that there won't be. The San Bruno cases are very complex. They have multiple proceedings. We've got civil cases. We've got U.S. attorney and Attorney General involved. And I think the complexity of multiple jurisdictions, multiple cases and also in my view, how interveners are funded in California, all that contributes to the fact that we haven't been able to resolve the cases. All other indications in terms of regulatory relations seem to be moving in a positive trend. We've gotten good feedback from the commission on the work we've done on the system. I think they're pleased with the fact we've been able to deliver 2 years in a row on our commitments to -- just a massive testing and analysis program of our gas system. We got good results in the return on equity proceeding, and we've had a number of other cases where we think we've gotten some good treatment. So I don't think there is going to be that spillover. I think just the complexities of San Bruno contribute to the inability to have an early resolution to it. Kent, you want to comment on rate cases?","Kent M. Harvey","Yes. Michael, in terms of the General Rate Case and the potential for delays, certainly, we've seen that happen with the other utilities of late in the state, but I also think that the commission is aware of the problems that, that creates. And I think there is a lot of interest in trying to get back on schedule. We have to acknowledge the fact that over the last year, between 2 General Rate Cases from the other utilities, the San Bruno proceedings, there has been a lot on the PUC's plate. So we're actually hopeful that we're going to have a more normal experience with the General Rate Case. And we certainly have a schedule that looks very reasonable. And even should there be a few months delay from the schedule, it would still be quite early in 2014, which has been kind of our experience over the last few proceedings. So we're hopeful that's really the future that we're going to face. If, in fact, we ended up under your scenario with a significant delay in the decision, that also makes it very difficult to run the company. And my guess is that it would put pressure on us to hold off on our planned increases that we'd like to make because we've obviously filed for a higher CapEx level than we've been currently spending and obviously higher expenses as well as we want to really improve the safety and the reliability of our system. And a significant delay would probably cause us to have to consider holding off on a lot of that.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And finally, Tony, when -- and just remind us a little bit how you're thinking about when you think you can position PG&E. Whether it's your gas transmission, electric transmission, the distribution businesses, when do you think you'll be in a position to talk about being able to kind of earn a normalized return on equity invested in your rate base?","Anthony F. Earley","Well, our objective is for the parts of the business that are subject to the current GRC, that when we get that decision, we will earn, be able to earn the allowed return there. We've got 1 additional year delay because the gas transmission and storage case is 1-year beyond the GRC. So it's kind of a stepped attainment of that goal to earn our allowed return. But I think when those cases come in, we're committed to working to earn the returns allowed in those cases.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So a little bit different change in tact here. Back on electric transmission, I'd be curious where the status of your own settlement conversations are going, and how you see that shaping up through the course of the year.","Thomas E. Bottorff","Yes, this is Tom Bottorff again. We continue to engage in settlement discussions with the parties. And some of you may have seen a recent note from the judge requesting parties to engage in a conference call on May 28. So we continue to exchange proposals, and those discussions are certainly challenging, given the debate over the rate of return. But nonetheless, a settlement does remain possible. And we really won't know for sure probably until mid-June.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And then ultimately, if that isn't resolved, do you think you bring up the issue of ROE methodology here? I mean how did -- is that something that you bring back to the table if that settlement isn't reached?","Thomas E. Bottorff","Well, we already filed an application for rehearing on that issue. We'll wait for FERC to act on that. If we don't receive a favorable opinion there, we do have the opportunity to pursue it in the courts. But again, there's still the opportunity to settle the proceeding, and hopefully that's where we end up.","Anthony F. Earley","This is Tony. I'll also add, the industry is taking that issue up. And as a whole, the industry believes it's inconsistent with FERC encouraging -- be able to build new transmission, that unless the policy goes back to where it was, it is going to inhibit that investment. So it's a broader issue than just our rate case.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with MorningStar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","We've -- there's obviously been a lot of talk on the GRC investments, the pipeline investments. I was wondering if we look longer term out beyond 2016, what are some areas where you see investment potential? Is it transmission, distribution, gas, electric? Longer term, what do you think are areas? Or are we just going to get down to a maintenance level?","Anthony F. Earley","Well, I think the answer to all of those things is, yes. We continue to look at our long-term strategy and our commitment to really be top quartile in all facets of operations. We're going to see higher-than-traditional levels of capital investment for the foreseeable future. I mean, we are working on our next 5-year plan internally, and I think we'll continue to see investment in the infrastructure. You'll recall that a lot of our infrastructure,certainly, the electric and gas infrastructure was really built in a post-World War II boom years, '50s, '60s and into the '70s, and a lot of that just -- we need replacement work. We've got a fabulous hydro system of 4,000 megawatts. Some of that was built right after the turn of the last century. We've done a very detailed analysis and are doing investment in those assets because they're great assets. They help us meet our renewable requirements. So for the foreseeable future, certainly, our planning horizon, we see a higher-than-historical levels of capital investment.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","When you say that, is that more on those lines of what we're seeing on the 2016 run rate? Or would that be even higher, $4.5 billion to $6 billion range?","Kent M. Harvey","Travis, this is Kent. I think we're going to be determining those years going forward beyond '16, once we complete our -- this year's planning process.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium.","Ashar Khan","Just wanted to check, Tony, how should we look at the, I guess, the fines coming? They'll be done by, of course, different parties, and there will be different numbers. As investors, how should we look at which is the more credible number? How should we judge this information coming next week?","Anthony F. Earley","Well it's hard to say without seeing them, but traditionally, some of the parties are known for taking extreme positions. I think probably the most important recommendation comes from the staff of the commission, but even there in the PSEP proceeding, we're able to get changes in the commission final decision, so none of them are final. There'll be a range, but I would say probably that the staff, the commission will be one that we're certainly going to be looking at very closely.","Ashar Khan","And then, can I ask you, once we get these recommendations, does your -- I know you have not accrued anything beyond what you have, but will that be a data point that, that disclosure could change, and hence, there could be more accruals at that period of time, or no?","Anthony F. Earley","Well it certainly will be a relative data point. We've got to take a look at it. I think we've said in the past, if they all come in and are really extreme, it doesn't help us narrow the gap. And we may not be able to make a change, but if some of them come in, in ranges that are helpful in trying to gather where the ultimate decision will be, we will be taking a hard look at that disclosure and what we've reserved, certainly, once we get those numbers.","Ashar Khan","And then my final question, Kent, can you just -- I apologize, I came in a little late into the call. Can you tell us how much equity has been issued to date out of what was projected for the year?","Kent M. Harvey","Yes. We issued in the first quarter, $430 million, and that's out of our guidance for the year of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. And I'll just remind you that the guidance, that $1 billion to $1.2 billion reflects the $200 million accrual we've taken for a fine or penalty, so anything in excess of that, would affect our expectations for the year.","Ashar Khan","Can I ask you, Kent, I know the range is pretty large. When does that range get narrowed down? I know that what gets a fine is on top of that, but it's a pretty wide range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. What is the determining factor when we know whether it's $1.5 billion, it's $1 billion or $2 billion? I'm just trying to get a sense.","Kent M. Harvey","I wouldn't expect that we're going to be narrowing that range this year. I actually think that, that amount of range is not that wide, given all the different factors that affect your financing needs because it's not only just on recovered gas costs, it's not only just capital expenditures, but it's all of our cash flows that happened during the year as well. There are a number of factors that can affect your equity need and the timing of your equity needs during a calendar year. So I don't consider the $200 million to be very wide, and I think it will probably stay in that range.","Gabriel B. Togneri","And Ashar, this is Gabe. I may have misheard you but I think I heard you say 1 --","Ashar Khan","No, I said it wrong. I apologize, I said it wrong.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just going back, quickly, to your gas progress. You describe on Page 3 the progress you've made in closing the NTSB recommendation. Apparently, there are 5 left to close out. Can you remind us, are any of those material in terms of cost? And if so, could you remind us what they are?","Christopher P. Johns","Yes. This is Chris. I don't have the list of all 5 of them, but what they are, they're the longer-term projects, like the hydrostatic testing and the insertion of the automatic and remote shutoff valves. So those are the longer-term projects, and the costs of all those are already incorporated in what our projections have been over the last couple of years. So all of that has already been taken into consideration.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes, these are already in your PSEP 1 and 2.","Christopher P. Johns","Right, exactly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up cash flow question. Just curious, I'm trying to think about the cash flow statement for this year and beyond. Outside of items that flow through the income statement and outside of CapEx, dividends, debt issuances, retirement, equity issuances, are there other things, like either significant pension contributions or the environmental remediation costs or maybe generator settlements or other items, working capital, that are significant either sources or uses of cash during 2013 and beyond?","Kent M. Harvey","Well, this is Kent. Michael, I mean obviously, we have amounts of everything. It's a complicated business with lots of cash flows. I would say the generator settlements, I don't see that happening near term and being a big impact on our cash flows. And in the case of pension contributions, for example, we recover those through rates and we basically fund those as their recovered through rates. I don't see, at least, the items that you mentioned as being out of the ordinary for us this year. One thing that does move for us significantly for cash flows is just collateral requirements associated with the commodity purchases and hedging we do on behalf of customers. And that's something that we get in the normal course. And if gas prices go down from current levels, we tend to have to post more collateral. If they go up, we actually reduce the amount of collateral. And that's probably the most obvious fluctuation that we tend to see quarter-over-quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just really quickly, just back to the San Bruno schedule, you guys said the ALJ decisions you were expecting sort of in July, is that right? Could you just review those very briefly for me.","Thomas E. Bottorff","Yes. This is Tom Bottorff again. What I was commenting on with respect to the decisions is that if there is an interim decision on the violations piece of the proceeding, that, that could come out as early as July. However, if the judges decide to wait to issue a ruling on both level of the violations and the fines and these [ph] associated with them, we may not see that decision until mid- to late-August.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just in general, in terms of resolution of the San Bruno schedule and everything, we've noticed that there's been some legislative inquiry and sort of, I guess, questions about the CPUC, in general. Do you see that as having any impact? Just in general, as you guys know, the California scheduling seems to be kind of a moving target, and I'm just sort of wondering if there's any potential here for slippage as a result of some of these issues that have been sort of brought up in the media and what have you. How should we think about that?","Anthony F. Earley","Yes. I don't think it's going to have any impact on the schedule. The schedule will move along. I think, as Tom laid out, that's what we -- our best guess is to what the schedule would look like. I don't think these other things will impact that.","Operator","There are currently no additional questions waiting from the phone lines.","Anthony F. Earley","All right, well in that case, I'll -- I know it's a very busy day with earnings season. But I will mention before we end the call that we'll see a number of you over the course of the month. We'll be at the ISI Conference next week, the Deutsche Conference the week following that and the Bernstein Conference at the end of the month.

After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","At this time, I would like to pass the conference over to your host, Chris Foster with PG&E. Chris, you may begin your conference.","Chris Foster","Thank you, Chris, and thanks to those of you on the phone for joining us. Here with me today in the room are Geisha Williams, Jason Wells, John Simon, Steve Malnight, and Pat Hogan.","Before I turn it over to Geisha, I would remind you that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements which are based on assumptions, forecasts, expectations, and information currently available to management. Some of the important factors that could affect the company's actual financial results are described on the second page of today's third quarter earnings call presentation.","The presentation also includes the reconciliation between non-GAAP earnings from operation and GAAP measures. We also encourage you to review our quarterly report on the Form 10-Q that will be filed with the SEC later today, and the discussion of risk factors that appears there and in the 2017 annual report.","With that, I'll hand it over to Geisha.","Geisha Williams","Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. Before we dive in, I first want to acknowledge the one-year anniversary of last fall's devastating wildfires. The efforts by members of the impacted communities to rebuild and improve emergency planning and preparedness for potential future fires continue. We are deeply involved in all of this work as we collectively adapt to the new normal. I also want to take a moment to thank our employees who have worked tirelessly throughout the peak wildfire season to keep our customers and community safe, including the recent activities associated with our decision to proactively shut off power for safety in parts of our service territory.","Following extensive outreach to key third-party agencies and our customers, in mid-October we shut off power in certain communities in the North Bay and Sierra Foothills in response to a forecast for extreme high fire risk weather conditions. When the weather improved, our crews conducted patrols across the entire 3,400 impacted miles of our power lines by helicopter, vehicle, and on foot, identifying multiple lines that had sustained damage. Service was restored to nearly all customers within about two days, and I would personally like to thank our impacted customers and communities for their patience while we worked to turn their lights safely back on.","This morning, I'll touch on Senate Bill 901, and then I'll walk you through our community wildfire safety program proposal, the multiyear effort targeted at wildfire risk mitigation that continues to evolve and expand. I'll reference some of the near-term progress we're making on enhanced programs, and also highlight our plans for the coming years. Finally, we have a number of regulatory proceedings that are underway or will be filed in the near-term, and I'll touch on a few of them today. These proceedings are a key area of focus over the coming months.","Now, as you all know, in September, the governor signed Senate Bill 901, which addresses a set of very complex wildfire related issues. While we believe this bill represents a constructive initial step, more important work remains. This law provides for improved financial stability for the investor-owned utilities in the state. However, it does not address inverse condemnation, and it remains our firm view that this must be revolved through legislative reforms or legal challenges. So while we're pleased with the progress made, we will continue our focus on reforming inverse condemnation, including as part of the Blue Ribbon Commission's work as it comes together during the upcoming legislative session.","Also coming out of the legislative session was the passage of Senate Bill 100, which sets a 60% renewable portfolio standard target by 2030. It also requires that 100% of all retail electricity sales come from RPS-eligible or carbon-free resources by 2045. California's investor-owned utilities are critical to meeting these clean energy goals. And we will require access to affordable capital in order to help the state meet these bold targets. As these policy reform and legal engagements continue, we are actively tackling this new normal on a variety of fronts. Our operational approach and focus must evolve with the growing threat posed by extreme weather conditions.","And with nearly a two-fold increase in the number of acres burned this year as compared to last, we are continuing to further ramp up the work that we began prior to the start of this year's wildfire season. Our expanded Community Wildfire Safety Program was established after the 2017 wildfires to implement additional precautionary measures intended to reduce or further reduce wildfire risks. It consists of three core elements that collectively target reducing risk in the high fire threat areas across our system, will improve situational awareness in the near-term, execute targeted infrastructure hardening in the highest risk areas, and further enhance our operational practices. These plans will be further detailed in the 2020 general rate case that will be filed later this year.","We believe that our proposal sets forth an appropriate level of risk reduction while balancing the cost to our customers, recognizing that we must strike a balance between the two. At a high level, we'll use a mix of the tools I'll describe and apply them in different parts of our service area to efficiently and effectively mitigate risk. First, we're enhancing our situational awareness which improves our ability to track detailed weather conditions, detect fires more rapidly, communicate more effectively with local, state, and federal agencies, and respond to potential fires that are underway. By their nature, some of these program investments can be executed in a relatively shorter timeframe, and intentionally target our highest risk areas.","Our teams are refining advanced fire modeling and detection systems which we'll utilize in our Wildfire Safety Operation Center that was opened earlier this year. The daily areal patrols we're conducting will feed the captured information to this team of experts. And additionally, over the next four years, we plan to deploy more than 600 high definition cameras, establish coverage across these high fire risk areas to roughly 90% by 2022.","Over the same timeframe, we're proposing to add approximately 1,300 weather stations, a density of one station roughly every 20 miles in the highest risk areas. When combined with existing weather stations, they will provide a significant level of awareness of localized weather differences experienced on the ground. As an example, one benefit over time becomes the ability to very narrowly enact targeted outages on specific circuits to minimize impacts to our customers during extreme fire condition as a last resort option that is part of our public safety power shutoff program.","These enhancements will give us additional information that we need to refine our risk assessment, pursue smarter system investments, and make timely decisions across the identified high fire threat districts. Our second area of focus is on hardening our system to further enable any and even safer, stronger, and more resilient grid for our customers.","In the next 10 years, we intend to upgrade our system across a targeted roughly 7000 miles of our highest risk areas with stronger and more weather-resistant poles and insulated tree wire. We're also proposing to replace other equipments such as fuses and transforms to further reduce the risk to our system. We will tailor our upgrades to match the terrain and conditions we expect to face to based on a more granular analysis of these fire-prone regions.","Finally, we are enhancing our operational practices to further align with the changing conditions we are facing daily. This is consistent with what you have seen us do over the last few years including when we significantly increased the vegetation management work we began in 2014 as a result of the historic drought and bark beetle infestation. We will be focused on an enhanced vegetation management program across our high fire threat areas in the coming years.","Part of this plan includes risk-informed targeted tree removal beyond the dead, diseased, and dying trees that may be within the fall zone of our overhead wires and that are part of our ongoing tree management efforts. Our risk reduction strategy also includes 12-foot radio clearances in high fire threat areas consistent with provisions of the fire prevention OIR issued by the CPUC at the end of last year.","And we also plan to clear all vegetation that hangs above our wires. That represents enhanced vegetation management work on over 25,000 miles of our overhead distribution lines in high fire threat areas that we are targeting to complete over the next eight years. We also have our public safety power shutoff program that I mentioned earlier. And we will, of course, only utilize this as a last resort in the most extreme forecasted weather conditions.","All of these efforts are in addition to our ongoing pole maintenance and visual and infrared inspections of our assets. We plan to continue patrolling our poles at frequencies within high fire threat areas beyond the compliance requirements in place in California. Collectively, this is an integrated comprehensive program to further reduce risk across our high fire threat areas.","Jason will cover in more detail the financial impacts of these important programs, but I would offer that they create substantial incremental investment opportunities that we will be presenting to the Commission for approval. Finally, I'll now walk through what is a very full regulatory calendar over the course of the next year.","Starting with one of our core rate cases, last month we filed our transmission owner case with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which included a 12.5% return on equity. In December, we will be filing our Nuclear Decommissioning Cost Triennial Proceeding which includes our request for cost recovery associated with the eventual decommissioning of our nuclear unit.","Next April, we intend to file our 2020 cost of capital application. While we evaluate the operating environment at the time of our filing, we believe our cost of capital is higher than the 10.25% currently authorized given the increased risk of extreme weather event, the continued application of inverse coadunations to invest their utilities, and the State's bold clean energy targets.","In mid-December, we will be filing our 2020 general rate case, which will include the system hardening work that I just mentioned as well as a continued focus on modernizing our Gas & Electric system to meet the evolving needs of our customers and communities. With the substantial investments I have referenced this morning, you can appreciate that top of mind with all of our proceedings is a balance between risk reduction and affordable service for our customers.","The CPUC's shared emphasis on customer affordability was clear in its final decision in the power charge and difference adjustment rule making. This ruling was a positive outcome and allows for equitable allocation cost amongst all our customers. We look forward to working with the Commission on future proceedings that also address cost allocation issues for our customers, including net energy metering.","Alongside these cases, we'll continue our path towards gaining efficiencies in our business. The CPUC recently indicated that in February we will need to file the first annual wildfire mitigation plan as required by SB-901 and the commission two weeks ago held its first meeting to cover some of the initial thinking on the scope of this work in their order instituting rule making.","We expect the vast majority of the work that we present will be captured in existing proceedings such as the 2020 GRC and recognize that the commission has expressed its desire to move expeditiously on these wildfire plants which we support. But we will also involve these plans as we continue to further strengthen our risk mitigation technology and practices which is why we annual plan and review the mandated by SB-901 are sensible approach.","Jason will walk you through our capital plan now, but I just wanted to emphasize we're highly focused on tapping the need for greater policy and financing certainty, executing on a series of necessary system investments and continuing to prioritize affordability for our customers. As I look back over the last quarter, we've made solid progress on a number of fronts including a community wildfire safety program and the passage of SB-901, and we're prepared to aggressively execute on additional work as we seek to further mitigate risks in the communities that we have the privilege to serve. Finally, we're committed to keeping you updated as we walk through our various regulatory proceedings over the course of the next year.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jason.","Jason Wells","Thank you, Geisha, and good morning everyone. Today, I'll walk through the results for the quarter. We will also provide CapEx and rate based guidance through 2023.","Before we dive in, I want to address the customer harm threshold through disallowance GAAP which will establish a cap on the amount that shareholders will contribute to cost associated with the 2017 fires. We're beginning to work constructively with the commission on a process to objectively review this unique charge from the legislature but I want to acknowledge that we're still in early stages. We've recognized there is great interest and better understanding this figure and believe it is critical to establish this threshold timely as new material information becomes available, we will continue to keep you apprised. Also reiterate that given the continued uncertainty, we're facing particularly around the amount and timing of any potential future financings, we're not providing earnings per share guidance on today's call.","With that, let's move now to the financial results for the quarter starting on slide six. Earnings from operations came in at a $1.13 per share. GAAP earnings including the items impacting comparability are also shown here. Legal and other costs associated with the Northern California wildfires net of insurance recoveries total $43 million pretax. Pipeline related expenses were $30 million pretax. We recorded $9 million pretax where legal costs related to the Butte Fire. Lastly, we reduced the previously recorded charge for capital costs that we anticipated would be disallowed based on previous gas transmission rate case decisions. This is driving a $38 million pretax gain this quarter.","Moving on to slide seven, which shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison of earnings from operations of a $1.12 in the third quarter of last year compared to a $1.13 this quarter. We were sixth sense favorable due to the growth in rate base earnings. We expect rate base growth to drive an increase in earnings of $0.25 for the full year. Timing of taxes which fluctuates with earnings throughout the year was $0.02 favorable for the quarter. On a full year basis we expect this item to net to zero, anticipated recovery of insurance premiums was a penny. Following the approval of our wildfire expense memorandum account in June, we expect a record roughly $0.09 in insurance recoveries in 2018.","We were $0.06 on favorable quarter-over-quarter due to the timing of our operational spend in 2017. We bundled some of our work to allow for more efficient execution in the second half of 2017 resulting in a delay in some spend from Q3 to Q4. This year, our spend reflects a more typical pattern we were a penny unfavorable due to the lower authorized return on equity in 2018 as compare to 2017.","We expect this to be approximately $0.05 on an annualized basis. Miscellaneous items, we're also a penny unfavorable this quarter. There are several offsetting items here including incremental wildfire risk mitigation spend associated with our community wildfire safety program. While we have several mechanisms in place to recover costs associated with this program. We believe there is some cost recovery risk as the expanded program ramps up.","Transitioning now to slide eight and our assumptions for 2018, our capital expenditure forecast for 2018 has increased by 200 million with the forecasted total spend of roughly $6.5 billion. This is primarily driven by incremental spend on our electric distribution substations, reflecting our continued focus on improve reliability for our customers. Partially offsetting this increase is reduction in our electric transmission spend mainly driven by project work moving from this year to feature periods.","In the lower right quadrant, we've also updated our other factors affecting earnings from operations. As I highlighted last quarter, the regulatory asset we are recording this year to recover a portion of our incremental insurance premium costs is expected to have a favorable impact on earnings. However, the incremental cost associated with our wildfire risk mitigation work will likely offset much of this favorability we don't anticipate these costs to have an impact on our earnings from operations in 2019. It remains our objective to our authorized return on equity on earnings from an operations basis in 2018.","Slide nine shows our forecasted items impacting comparability. We've narrowed the range for pipeline related expenses to 40 million to 50 million pretax, while small portion of this work will carry over into 2019. We will discontinue reporting these costs and adding impact and comparability after 2018.","We've also narrowed the range for legal cost associated with a Butte Fire resulting in a revised range of $35 million to $45 million. The high-end of the range for the Butte Fire also includes $200 million for third-party claims cost consistent with last quarter.","Estimated legal and other costs associated with the Northern California wildfires, reflecting narrowed range of a $150 million and to $260 million. We've also reduced the expected insurance recoveries associated with the Northern California wildfires to roughly $400 million. While we ultimately expect to recover up to the full amount of our insurance policy, the timing of this recovery I shifted out a bit. The reduction and anticipated gas related capital disallowances of $38 million pretax reflect the partial reversal of the previous disallowances of capital costs that I mentioned earlier. Finally, anticipated 2017 insurance premium cost recoveries are consistent with last quarter.","Slide 10 shows our forecasted capital expenditures from 2018 through 2023. For 2019, we expect our CapEx to be roughly $6.4 billion compared to our forecast of approximately $6 million last quarter. This increases primarily driven by roughly $300 million in system hardening work associated with our Community Wildfire Safety Program.","For providing an annual range for CapEx beginning in 2020 and continuing through 2023 with a low end of $5.7 billion reflecting amounts currently authorized in our rare cases and the high-end of the roughly $7 billion based on amounts we have file or expect to file and future rate case proceedings. The high-end also reflects the capital we are proposing to spend as part of our Community Wildfire Safety Program at roughly $700 million annually from 2020 through 2023. These amounts will be reflected in our upcoming 2020 GRC request, with similar levels anticipated in future GRC requests.","Slide 11 provides a rate-based growth with a compound annual growth rate of approximately 7% to 8.5% from 2018 through 2023. As Geisha mentioned the passage of Senate Bill 901 represents progress and we look forward to executing on this robust capital plan in the coming years.","California's is bold clean energy goals continue to foster the environment growth, which only increase with the recent passage of Senate Bill 100. Attracting capital to execute on these goals is more important than ever and we look forward to partnering with a state on continuing to drive this positive change for Californian's environment. Of course, our shareholders require a fair return for their investment, needed to make these transformational changes. As Geisha noted, we will be considering the factors that drive incremental risk in California when we file our cost of capital application expert.","Moving now to equity, we should approximately $140 million through our internal programs through the third quarter. While participation of these plans can vary throughout the year, I expect that they will generate roughly $200 million for the full year. As of September 30, 2018, our equity ratio was 51.5% at the utility resulting in a pretax cushion of roughly $500 million relative to the 51% minimum that would require a capital structure waiver.","Looking ahead, given the continued uncertainty regarding our financing plans, we are not issuing equity guidance today for 2019 and for future years. However, we do expect to continue to utilize our internal programs in future periods.","On slide 13, we've summarized the key factors that will influence future equity issuances.","In closing, I want to reinforce that we are laser-focused on working through the items that will ultimately provide the investment community greater clarity.","We have a strong growth plan in front of us, and we are well positioned to execute on it. At the same time, we continue to drive efficiencies in our business as we look for ways to keep our service affordable for all of our customers, a key focus in coming years particularly as we ramp up on system hardening to continue to keep our communities we serve safe. While this year have proved challenging, our priority remains on solutions that result in favorable outcomes for both our customers and shareholders. And this same priority will guide our efforts associated with our wildfire litigation strategy and how we approach the customer threshold process.","With that, let's open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Jonathan Arnold","Good morning, guys.","Jason Wells","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold","Quick question on, I'm just curious at previous occasions you've give sort of a three-year GRC type outlook and this is the 2023, if I'm not wrong, would be after the to-be-filed 2020 GRC, or is it are you perhaps signaling that you could look for a four-year GRC here?","Jason Wells","No, Jonathan. Our intention with providing the five-year forecast was to reflect our confidence in the long-term spending program that we're proposing. We anticipate the 2020 GRC will cover the period of 2020 through 2022, but we have light of sight to the long-term spending plans which gave us confidence to provide the five-year forecast.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay, that's helpful. And then you also -- I think the details you gave on the Community Wildfire Safety Program, you're showing us a five-year look. But what's the kind of real longevity on this. And yes, you mentioned spending at similar levels in future GRCs, plural, if I heard you correctly.","Geisha Williams","Jonathan, this is Geisha. Our view is the Community Wildfire Safety Program has different elements. The veg management work that I described, our intention is to really address that 25,000 miles over an eight-year period. On the system hardening, we're look at a 10-year focus on roughly the 7,000 miles. And this is a long-term approach to frankly de-risking our assets in these high fire prone areas.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. And then just had one other thing, when I look at the rate base for 2019 it's obviously higher than what you had approved in the prior GRC. Is the difference there pretty much all to do with this community planned spending or are there some other -- can you unpack any other differences, Jason, there, as we're trying to translate that into sort of probability of getting approved at that level, et cetera?","Jason Wells","I do think if there's low cost recovery risk. In 2019, the higher level of CapEx and rate base associated with the Community Wildfire Safety Program is roughly $300 million. The remaining difference is essentially the timing of spend associated with our general rate case and gas transmission storage rate case decisions with a small amount coming from CapEx. Essentially, we have been spending more in the later years of those rate cases then we did in the earlier years. But the spend, overall, during those rate case periods is generally consistent with what has been authorized in those cases.","Jonathan Arnold","So you would isolate the amount by which '19 rate base exceeds currently approved amounts to the piece related to the wildfire program, is that fair?","Jason Wells","To roughly that $300 million that we intend to spend for the Community Wildfire Safety Program.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay, thank you very much, guys.","Geisha Williams","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Stephen Byrd","Hi, good morning.","Geisha Williams","Morning.","Jason Wells","Good morning, Stephen.","Stephen Byrd","It was helpful disclosure you provided in terms of the CapEx. And I'm just sort of thinking through that CapEx that you laid out on slide 10. And at the higher end of that range, at the $7 billion, kind of the far right bar, how should we think about how you would fund that? Would you be able to rely solely on your programs? And I'm kind of thinking steady state; I know there are a number of moving parts in the near-term, but longer-term at that higher end. Could you rely on your equity programs? Would you need to go out and seek larger amounts of equity in offering, how should we think about sort of financing that $7 billion number you lay out?","Jason Wells","Stephen, I think at the $7 billion level the required equity contribution it would exceed what we anticipate to recover through our internal programs, both kind of the amount that we're seeing this year as well as sort of the amounts that were generated prior to the 2017 fires. And so I really think there's a number of factors that are going to be impacting our financing plans, mostly largely associated with the 2017 wildfires. As we think about dividend reinstatement down the road, we are going to have to balance the growth that we see in our business with the competitive payout ratio of our dividend.","And so we will balance all those factors. So I think it's too early to really be specific with how we will raise that incremental equity that will be needed to fund that higher level of CapEx.","Stephen Byrd","Yes, and I respect that, there are a lot of factors. Actually -- and just you had mentioned dividend, which was another area I just wanted to touch on. When you think about both the factors that are really driving your thought about potential dividend reinstatement but also I think, importantly, about the policy to pay out level, et cetera. Would you mind just giving us your latest thoughts around the key drivers there, both of timing the three institute as well as sort of philosophically, does -- obviously we have much higher wildfire risk than we used to. Does that factor into your decision about payout ratio, any color on the dividend would be helpful.","Geisha Williams","Yes, thanks for that question, Stephen. I can tell you, we couldn't be more cognizant of the importance of dividends and the role that dividends play to our utility investors. So as we think about this, I would also tell you that our Board is very engaged, and is continuously evaluating, both the timing of the dividend reinstatement as well as to what level it should consider. But it has to look at a number of factors that are impacting our environment. So for example, we've got to take a look at what are the ultimate determination of the cause of the pub fire from Cal Fire. What is the Safety and Enforcement Division's report in terms of our operating practices in regard to the fires that we had in '17? And we're also looking at what are the potential decisions of local DAs in terms of brining charges against the company.","Now, all of these factors we believe could impact the determination of the customer harm threshold process that is going to be kicking off at the CPUC. What I would tell you is that, well, we're not looking at any of these specific items or milestones as a triggering event. We do need to acknowledge that there are a number of uncertainties that could impact the longer-term value of the company. So with all that said, the focus is on, in our Board anyway, is really to consistently evaluate all of these relevant factors. It's a pretty fluid situation. And our goal is to provide you with clarity in terms of the dividend reinstatement when it's appropriate. But we're just not in a position to do that today.","Stephen Byrd","Understood, thanks. I'll get back in the queue. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Steve Fleishman","Hi. Just on the affordability, could you maybe give a little more color on this capital plan when you see all the different factors, costs -- cost cuts, and PPAs that roll off, kind of what do your rate levels look like over the five-year plan?","Geisha Williams","Well, I think I'll talk about it pretty broadly. I mean, we are absolutely focused on costs, and we understand how important the issue of affordability is for our customers, particularly at a time when we're proposing additional wildfire-related spend, and then also write the potential for the securitization of third-party liability in the years ahead. So we understand we've got to take a look back and figure out how do we expand the necessary work to de-risk our system, while at the same time focus on doing that in the most cost effective way possible. So as you know, Steve, we've been really focused on our affordability initiatives for several years. And those initiatives, as we look at our costs and our efficiencies will apply as well for all of the hardening effort that we have planned.","So we're also, frankly, looking at our own costs, our own programs, and at the same time looking at broader policies that are designed to release cost pressure. So for example, and I mentioned this in my opening remarks, we advocated really aggressively for changes to the PCIA, and we're gratified to see the substantial progress that we made on correcting that cost shift from CCA customer to a broader bundled customer. Next year, we've got another opportunity to take a look at those cost shifts as we start thinking about net energy metering and how to reduce those cost shifts as well. So our view is to look at the work we can do on our own in terms of our own programs, our own efficiencies, while also looking more holistically at the policy area to see if there's opportunities to reduce costs further for our customers.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then you probably noticed that Edison gave the -- their view of their -- I guess fall on the Thomas Fire prior to Cal Fire actually issuing a report. Do you see any chance that you would do that on pubs or you're definitely going to wait till Cal Fire issues a report?","Geisha Williams","I think that we're at this point in the game, we are really very much waiting on Cal Fire to complete its work. We're looking forward to seeing them complete their work. And we obviously don't have access to all the information, all the evidence, all the various things that they're considering. So it's our belief that at this point, given what we know, that it would be prudent to allow Cal Fire to complete its work.","Steve Fleishman","Okay, that makes sense. And one last question on the customer threshold filing, when you do make a filing is it going to be more of here's what the procedure we think should be or will it actually be here's what we actually think the customer threshold should be?","Geisha Williams","Well, I think that when you look at SB 901, it left a lot of room for interpretation in terms of how to answer that question, which I think adds a lot of complexity, and frankly likely adds a lot of stakeholders into the process who might be really interested in the outcome. Our point of view is and what we've been advocating is that the process, whatever that process is, needs to move forward soon. And we've been expressing that view throughout this last quarter. So not exactly sure in the bottom line, Steve We're working expeditiously with the CPUC, we're asking them to take up this important question.","What I would tell you is we are working urgently. This is a high priority; we want to bring clarity to both the process as well as what the final threshold amount is going to be as soon as possible. We understand how important that number, that process is to the various stakeholders.","Steve Fleishman","Okay, thank you very much.","Geisha Williams","You bet.","Operator","Your next question is from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Greg Gordon","Thanks, good morning.","Geisha Williams","Good morning.","Greg Gordon","Has there been a formal process that's even been started in terms of engagement between the different utilities who'll be affected by the stress test, or as we're calling it now, the customer threshold and the CPUC, so that we'll have a sense of when that -- there's been an official sort of starting date for that?","Geisha Williams","Well, first of all, I think in terms of the stress tests, the customer harm threshold for 2017, it's really a PG&E issue primarily, and so we've been, as I mentioned earlier just to Steve, engaged in dialogue with the CPUC on the importance of getting started, getting started quickly. We recognize that there likely will be other stakeholders that will have an interest in the proceeding, whatever that may look like. And so it's in process, but there isn't an official date or timing that I can give you at this time.","Greg Gordon","Got you, thank you. And how does the wildfire mitigation plan filing sort of dovetail with the GRC, are they sort of operating in parallel but relate to each other as it pertains to the $7 billion spend that you've requested?","Geisha Williams","Yes, that's a good way of thinking about it. We're using the vehicle that's available to us, which is I think appropriately the GRC, the 2020 GRC, to propose our wildfire mitigation activity -- our wildfire mitigation plan. Having said that, on an annual basis, the CPUC will take a look at what the wildfire management plans are. And so they've kicked off, through that OIR process we're using. The GRC is a funding mechanism, and then we'll have a separate proceeding to approve those plans through the SB 901 annual review process.","Greg Gordon","Got you. And the Safety Enforcement Division is conducting a review of the fires as well. If my memory serves me correctly, I don't see that on the timeline of key regulatory cases here. But when we last spoke your lead director indicated that was something that you were keenly watching. So can you explain why and when the expected timing is of its release?","Steve Malnight","So this is Steve Malnight. Greg, thanks for the question. The SED has that they are investigating working alongside with Cal Fire and others. We expect that they will issue a report once all of the Cal Fire reports are out. We don't really yet know the timing. And we don't know what would result from that. Obviously as you know this PUC has wide discretion to consider potential penalties if they found something as a result of that investigation or also could launch an OII. I think at this point, we don't know yet where that proceeding will go but we've mentioned that that is a factor that's out there as well.","Q \u2013 Greg Gordon","Okay, final one really quick, the safety culture investigation that came out of the San Bruno fire is still open, what are our expectations there in terms of whether that will ever be resolved?","Steve Malnight","So this is Steve Malnight again, thanks. The recently the PUC actually issued a proposed decision in the safety culture OII. That proposed decision effectively agrees with the recommendations from North Star and the North Star originally reported and requires PG&E to implement them by July 2019 with quarterly reports to the commission. So we're actively engaged in implementing those recommendations and moving forward and we expect that the commission could vote on their proposed decision, I think the earliest is at the second meeting in November.","Q \u2013 Greg Gordon","Okay. And there is no ROE penalty proposed in that meeting?","Steve Malnight","That proposal was, that proceeding was just to look at those recommendations and where they go, they did they rejected other recommendations from other parties. So it's just about implementing the existing recommendations from North Star.","Q \u2013 Greg Gordon","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Praful Mehta","Thanks so much, hi guys.","Geisha Williams","Good morning.","Jason Wells","Good morning, Praful.","Praful Mehta","Good morning. So there is obviously a lot going on the legislative legal side related to wildfires and waiting for the customer threshold as well, how should we think about the financing and the plan for like the 2019-2020 timeframe given all of these uncertainties, is there any near-term equity I guess related to the current fires that you already know about or how should we think about all of this playing out I guess for the 2019-2020 timeframe?","Jason Wells","Praful, I think it's just too early to be to be definitive there with the suspension of the dividend, there is not a near-term equity need, I think the sort of clarity around sort of the longer-term equity needs for 2019 and 2020 are really largely going to be driven by the timing of the customer harm threshold process and so it's just really too early to put a date to that time.","Praful Mehta","Got it. So in the near-term any financing need would be more funded through holding company debt or revolver borrowings?","Jason Wells","Currently, we don't have any discrete equity needs, we're going to continue to issue equity through our internal programs as I mentioned in my prepared remarks and we will continue to raise long-term debt consistent with our rate base growth as we periodically need that as we have in the past.","Praful Mehta","Understood. And then in terms of the customer threshold again just to get back to that given the importance wanted to understand is there any -- when do you expect I guess somebody to get appointed to do that process, you said you already working with the CPUC on it, so is that directly with the CPUC or do you expect somebody to be appointed by the CPUC and what is the timing for that?","Geisha Williams","Let me start Praful, it's a very fluid situation without specific sort of milestones that have to be achieved by a particular time, so it's a difficult question to ask in terms of how the CPUC is looking at it at this point, we're continuing to advocate for timely starting the process whatever that process may look like, we understand that other stakeholders will have a point of view on that as well as will we but there is not a specific series of actions that are needed to be taken in order to provide that customer harm threshold analysis to be completed. As I mentioned earlier, SB-901 provided pretty broad discretion to the CPUC on how it handle something like that.","Praful Mehta","Understood. And do you expect the Overland report to have any kind of framework or guidepost to that process or do you see this as completely different?","Geisha Williams","It could, again it's I think it possibly could be something that acts as an overarching framework but we certainly don't know what the CPUC's intentions are what they're thinking in terms of how or if to use the Overland report.","Praful Mehta","Got it. Thanks so much guys.","Geisha Williams","You bet.","Operator","Your next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey good morning everyone.","Geisha Williams","Good morning.","Jason Wells","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So I wanted to go back to the projected rate base figures you provide through 23, I wanted to understand just reconciling the CapEx ranges the 577 relative to the rate base. When you think about the lower and upper ends, does that necessarily reconcile with the 577 or there other moving factors that we should be aware of when it comes to whether it's tax reform or perhaps other items that you may be accruing to rate basis? I want to make be extra clear about this particular given the wide range of the rate base.","Jason Wells","Julien, this is Jason. Largely it's a reflection of the CapEx, obviously the rate base figures have assumptions around appreciation, deferred taxes but none of those things are unusual nature, they're just sort of byproducts of the CapEx spending plans.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. So said differently to be clear, if you got the $7 billion number through that 2022, 2023 period that would be consistent with the upper end of that range to be sure?","Jason Wells","Yes, that's right.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Is that reason for the wide range is not a reflection of some other factor to simply reflection of the range of the CapEx itself?","Jason Wells","In a compounding nature of that of the wide range of CapEx over that period of time, yes.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Great, excellent. I wanted to come back to Steve's earlier question around the customer threshold process, how do you in light of the commentary around the Overland report, what other methodologies are you thinking about again, again I know it's early days in the process but how would you frame it outside of the Overland report given how relevant or lack of relevant data points there might be within that?","Steve Malnight","Hi, this is Steve Malnight, Julien. I think as Geisha was saying really look there are a lot of different processes and pathways that this proceeding could go, I think we're engaging in conversations with the commission about different potential pathways, different processes that could be engaged in other interveners will have, they will have their point of view as well. I appreciate the desire to know more, I wish we just don't have more to really tell you about that today and I think as you can imagine many different ways they could go and we're going to continue those conversations.","As Geisha said, obviously this is an urgent focus for us, it is something we're focused on driving clarity on not only process but obviously getting to clarity on the amount as well and we'll continue to keep you updated as we go.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Right, sorry. Just a quick clarification on the rate faith given that a lot of the wildfire mitigation seems to be running through the GRC process as well as I suppose in parallel a wildfire mitigation plan. Do you expect to get definitive kind of CapEx related updates more in the mid part of next year or are we really waiting for a GRC outcome before getting real comfort on where you are in this range. Just to be clear incremental over time obviously?","Jason Wells","I think the incremental CapEx spending associated with the wildfire mitigation efforts roughly $700 million a year in that 2020 to 2022 period. I think we'll get a stronger signal next year as we go through the wildfire safety action plan at the commission obviously we're going have to wait for the GRC decision to finalize that overall spending level. But next year we should get a good indication of the support for the program that we're proposing.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael Lapides","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Real quick on interpreting Senate Bill 901 and what costs are potentially recoverable via securitization and what are not. I get it that anything that would be inverse condemnation related would be recoverable via at least some portion of that if not all would be via recoverable securitization. What about private liability or if there any negligence related costs that come out of various lawsuits that are under way. Is that covered under 901 or is that covered separately?","Steve Malnight","Michael this is Steve Malnight. So under Senate Bill 901 what it really did was establish the customer harm threshold to apply against all costs that the utility could bear as a result of the wildfires. So it really is indifferent to the drivers. It's just the point that beyond a certain threshold, customers would be broadly harmed and therefore the better alternative past that point is securitization. So really it doesn't speak specifically about different aspects of the costs.","Michael Lapides","Okay and is there is at this point meaning or at least until you have the docket next year. There is no real way of kind of knowing or defining what is that kind of harm to all rate payers' number or level. You've got to literally go through that and have you in the commission and others kind of analyze that and come up with whatever the best estimate is for any number of years?","Steve Malnight","Yes, that's correct. The Senate Bill 901 really doesn't spell it out beyond the general direction for the commission to consider, customer harm and the inability for us to continue investing in the safety and reliability of the system, so that they left it to the commission to decide the best process and pathway and that's what the commission will be doing.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you guys. Much appreciate it.","Geisha Williams","You bet.","Operator","Your next question is from Christopher Turnure with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Christopher Turnure","Hi, I wanted to follow-up on the fire safety or fire mitigation plans that you're going to be filing shortly with the commission. How specific do you think the plans should be or how specific do you think the CPC would want those plans in terms of milestones to achieve the exact timelines cost buckets et cetera as opposed to just one or two big numbers over the 12 or 18 month timeframe?","Steve Malnight","Yes, Chris. This is Steve Malnight again. So I think that that is the process that the commission will lay out in their scoping memo which will be coming soon. As they've laid out this process, so they'll issue the scoping memo we'll have the discussion in November we'll be filing those plans in February and they will be deciding on those plans three months after.","So they've set out an aggressive timeline here. I think this would be the first time through So a big part of it will be the specifics. I should say that as you and Jason laid out in the comments, we have a very specific plan in mind in terms of what we want to go deploy and we'll be advocating for that through this proceeding as well as through the GRC. Those will align and our initial filing and the GRC filing, so the Commission will set that really soon. We'll see more on what they're going to propose.","Christopher Turnure","Okay. Got it. And then my second question is on your overall capital plan and funding requirements. There's been a couple of questions on this already obviously but I think it's probably fair to assume that you view your cost of equity as being above your authorized cost of equity right now. How reasonable a source of funding is equity overall for your five year plan, given the current numbers authorized to you by the commission and your current estimate of your own cost of capital.","Chris Foster","Yes, we've seen, we've clearly seen an increase in the in our cost of capital Chris and I think in recent transmission on a rate case that we filed with first reflects our current thinking about that elevated cost of capital, when we think broadly about sort of funding CapEx over this five year time horizon. I think what an important element of that is going to be the timely resolution of the customer harm threshold as well as the securitization of costs above that threshold. And so, our focus right now is working constructively to bring clarity to those items to lower our cost of capital so that our customers don't have to pay that elevated cost for an extended period of time. I think it's really too early to be specific or any more specific than that.","Christopher Turnure","Okay, fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.","Shahriar Pourreza","Hey, good morning guys.","Jason Wells","Good morning, Shahriar.","Geisha Williams","Good morning.","Shahriar Pourreza","I know you touched a little bit on the ultimate cost to the consumer but maybe specifically honed on O&M, obviously it's a healthy amount of O&M that you guys requested in the current wildfire plan. So how should we sort of think about your O&M growth path on a go forward basis especially as we think about the rate impact given sort of the sizable capital program you presented today. I mean knowing the plans you know and obviously they'll you know somewhat change through time. Is there a way we should be thinking about your O&M growth profile?","Jason Wells","Sure, this is Jason. I think it's too early to give a specific O&M trajectory, what I will say is as Geisha has mentioned in her comments we are laser focused on continuing to drive efficiencies in our core work. We have lowered the cost of our base O&M over the last couple of years however those reductions have been largely offset by cost increases, we're seeing with insurance costs as well as the elevated levels of vegetation management that we're proposing here. So while we've made good progress, there's more to do and we are laser-focused on continuing to execute on those long-term affordability programs for the company.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. And then, just real quick from legality standpoint, the power shutoff program is leading the summary parachuting for the disruption, is this sort of any merits to these cases?","Geisha Williams","Hey, Shah, this is Geisha. I'll tell you know actually initiating that Public Safety Power Shutoff program a couple weeks ago was a very, very difficult decision. But from our point of view, it was a right one given the forecast that we have of extreme weather conditions. The real -- the real-time whether modeling that our team was doing and frankly field observations from our employees. So as we took a look at all that, there was no doubt in our mind that we have to initiate it and I would tell you if we are faced with similar conditions in the future, similar forecasts.","We're going to do it again, it's as we've talked about this in the past, it's not a free play when you do a Public Safety Power Shutoff, there's clearly implications associated with doing right that, but as we look at the potential implications of another ignition associated with these extreme wildfire conditions? We've got to take the broader public safety. Sort of considerations in mind and that's what we've done. As far as litigation and whether it has merits, I'm not sure I mean, that's something that will have to play out over time, but we would do it again, we would absolutely do it again. I don't know John, if you want to comment on that.","John Simon","Well, we haven't seen any claims from it yet and the CTC in the CTC will evaluate the reasonableness of our actions. We file the fairly detailed report on what that was. So we are pretty hopeful, confident that they're going to see what we saw when they read that and not overly fixated on claims at this point.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. And then, Geisha you've been you've been pretty visible as far as the somewhat of the shortcomings of 901, though, it was obviously a very good start. Are you going to sit out next year as far as looking for a fix around inverse and let the state kind of digest 901 and reasonableness and or are you going to pursue a fix next year?","Geisha Williams","Well, I think that it's a -- inverse contradictions flawed, and it needs to be addressed as I've been -- as you said, very, very vocal about that. As we look at the next legislative session. I think one of the most important drivers or one of the most important activities in that will be the Blue-Ribbon Commission's work looking at wildfire issues broadly and including whether and how to socialize those costs. So we think the Blue-Ribbon Commission's work will be important and we will be engaged in that to the extent that we can be and that work is supposed to be completed in July, so will it be too late for the next legislative session? I'm not sure; it depends on how much work they've done, how much they've socialized, how much they've been able to engage with stakeholders and the legislators in particular. But we are certainly going to continue to advocate for a change, whether that be through legal court sort of system or through continued legislative process. We're going to continue to look for opportunities to change what we believe is a flawed doctrine, not really properly applied to investor owned utilities.","Shahriar Pourreza","Terrific. Thanks, guys.","Geisha Williams","You bet.","Operator","Your next question is from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open.","Paul Patterson","Good morning, guys.","Geisha Williams","Good morning.","Jason Wells","Good morning.","Paul Patterson","Just to follow-up on the cost of capital. Did I hear you correctly to say that it was kind of in the ballpark of what you power for transmission? That's your kind of thinking. I know there's going to be some fine tuning et cetera. But that's kind of a proxy we should be thinking about or could there be a change in equity ratio or ROE from there?","Jason Wells","I think it's too early to be definitive, but clearly that filing with the FERC represents our current thinking on our current cost of capital and how we will approach the cost of capital proceeding with the CPC next spring. But it is early and they're going to be a number of factors that that may influence that filing.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then, just finally following up on the affordability question that's been asked, is there a metric or a particular class of customer that we should be thinking about as being particularly sensitive? Just how should we think about that I mean if it's -- if there's any sort of direction we have yet in terms of exam? I mean, what we're talking about, I assume it's not just average rates across the system or is it. Can you give us a little bit more of a feeling for what we should be thinking about sort of the thresholds that that might be really key?","Jason Wells","Yes, thank you for the question. And we look at customer affordability through a number of different lenses and its sort of highest sort of view, we consider sort of rate increases in line with inflation. But we also do look at share of wallet or share of disposable income for the different communities we serve. And I think really where the pressure point largely lies is more in the Central Valley, those customers who are higher users of electricity feel more of the burden of cost increases. And so that's why we're trying to work very diligently in with a lot of rigor on continuing to drive not just affordability and our efficiency and our spend, but also focusing on working with a commission on the policies that may impact those communities as well.","Paul Patterson","So could a rate design change, perhaps augment some of the issues or how should we think about the potential for rate design particularly alleviating some of the affordability issues versus actual cost cutting and what have you?","Jason Wells","I think that, we look at these issues holistically. It's not just spent, it's the policies associated with that. I think the recent proposed decision on PCIA was a decision rather on PCIA, it was a good step in terms of minimizing the impact on some of those communities that are sort of move sensitive to rate increases. And I think as the commission looks at net energy metering. I think that's another opportunity for us to update our rate design to take more pressure off some of those communities that face the most direct pressure from customer -- rate increases.","Paul Patterson","Great, excellent.","Operator","This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I'll now turn it back over to Chris Foster.","Chris Foster","Thank you, Chris. I'll just wrap this up. Thanks everyone for joining us this morning on the call, and please have a safe day.

[Operator Instructions] ","At this time, I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Gabe Togneri, with PG&E Corporation. Thank you, and enjoy your conference. You may proceed, Mr. Togneri.","Gabriel B. Togneri","Thanks, Monique, and hello, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for our call. This morning, you'll hear from Tony Earley, Chris Johns and Kent Harvey, who will be providing our remarks, and other members of the team are also here and will participate in the Q&A. ","Our discussion, of course, will include forward-looking statements based on assumptions and expectations reflecting information currently available to management. Some of the important factors that could affect the company's results are described in Exhibit 1 located in the Appendix of today's slides. We encourage you to review those and also to review the discussion of risk factors that appears in our 2011 annual report and in the form 10-Q that will be filed with the SEC later today. ","And with that, I'll hand it over to Tony.","Anthony F. Earley","Thank you, Gabe, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. On our last earnings call, we outlined our top priorities for 2012. But I'd like to start today by reviewing these priorities again, because I think they provide a good context for the discussion of our actions and results from the last quarter as well as set the context for our plans for the rest of the year. ","So if you look at Slide 2, our key objectives for the year are, first, we want to resolve as many of the gas-related issues as we can in 2012. Second, we want to position the company for a long-term success. And third, we want to work very hard at rebuilding relationships with stakeholders. ","So let me start with the gas issues. We're continuing to work to the various regulatory and legal proceedings. We'd like to resolve the regulatory proceedings as soon as possible, because the sooner we get clarity on these issues, the better it is for everyone from the utility to regulators to our customers. There's no way to predict whether settlement discussions will go forward or be successful, but we do support this approach as a way to accelerate the process. If and when there's any further news to report on this, we'll share it at the appropriate time. ","On the legal front, we also continue our efforts to settle the various individual claims related to the tragedy in San Bruno. Our goal is to provide victims with fair compensation. Just as with the regulatory issues, we'd like to do that as soon as possible, and we're making progress towards that goal. Separately, we were pleased in this quarter to reach a critical agreement with the city of San Bruno by making a contribution to benefit the citizens of the community. This was an important milestone for us in that it helps the city move forward in the healing process. And it's important for us, because it's another step on the road towards resolution of all of these issues.","Let me shift to the steps we're taking to position the company for long-term success starting with the gas business. We're maintaining the momentum that we established last year with safety improvement efforts in gas operations, and Chris is going to provide you with lots more detail on what's planned for 2012. ","We've also now essentially completed the restructuring of the gas business, which has significantly improved accountability and the expertise in the organization. Recently, several highly experienced gas industry veterans have come onboard, filling our remaining vacancies for vice presidents overseeing key areas in gas operations. By the end of this quarter, we hope to complete the last of our high-level hires and have the team completely in place. We're also continuing to add new talent in other areas of the company. This includes officers with excellent credentials in customer care and information technology, which clearly are areas that where we can benefit from their deep expertise. ","And then most recently, we announced the hiring of Ed Halpin from the South Texas Project as the Senior Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer. Ed's full-time presence at Diablo Canyon builds even greater depth into an already strong nuclear program that we've got. ","All of these additions to the team give me greater confidence that we're making the changes necessary to achieve a new level of performance and operations in customer service. Everyone on the team is focused on safety compliance and continuous improvement and working to close the gaps between where we are today and where we need to go to deliver outstanding service to our customers.","So last, let me touch on rebuilding relationships. Chris and I and many of our other senior leaders continue to meet as often as possible with customers, policymakers, business partners and others. It's become clear to me from the conversations that we have that our stakeholders do want us to be successful, and broadly speaking, we're getting positive feedback on the direction that we're moving. ","In that vein, a few recent successes are worth noting, because I think they demonstrate we're doing a better job of listening to our customers. So for example, for that segment of customers who do not want to participate in our SmartMeter program, we now have an opt-out alternative. Another example is the economic development rate that we've proposed to the CPUC. In these difficult economic times, this is a way to bring electric rate relief to businesses that need it to preserve or create jobs at our service area. And finally, for our residential customers, we're working to further modify the current multi-tiered rate structure to streamline and simplify it and improve the affordability of our service. ","Rebuilding relationships will be a long-term effort, but these are steps in the right direction, and we'll continue to look for these kinds of opportunities going forward. Ultimately though, we know that the key is for us to continue to deliver what we say we're going to deliver. Importantly, we did that last year when we completed our aggressive hydrostatic testing commitment and our operating pressure validation in our high-consequence gas transmission pipelines. ","So with that introduction, let me turn the mic over to Chris. Chris?","Christopher P. Johns","Thanks, Tony. Good morning, everyone. So this morning, I'm going to provide the regulatory and operational updates that are described briefly on Slide 3. Starting with the regulatory side, procedural schedules have now been set for all 3 of the gas investigations with hearing dates scheduled for the fall. The CPUC staff has filed its findings and reports in 2 out of the 3 of those investigations, and they are going to provide the report on the third one at the end of this month. These are all important milestones in each of the cases on our path forward towards resolution. ","In our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan, the administrative law judge held 2 weeks of hearings at the end of March. A key issue covered in the testimony of the various parties was the categorization of work proposed in the company's safety plan. We believe that most of the work is needed to comply with the new standards, while other parties argued that much of it should have been done to comply with existing standards. We expect that final resolution will deal with both the scope of the gas work required through 2014 and the allocation of cost between shareholders and customers. We continue to feel our proposal for this split is appropriate. And that is that PG&E shareholders will continue to pay the cost necessary to comply with existing regulations, but work that we undertake to meet new standards set by the CPUC is appropriate to recover from our customers. The final decision in the safety plan is expected in September.","In other regulatory news, on April 20, we filed our cost of capital case as did the other California utilities. And we proposed a reduction in our return on equity to 11%, and that's from our current level of 11.35%. We did not propose any changes to our common equity ratio of 52% nor to the current multiyear adjustment mechanism. That mechanism would continue to link ROE to the performance of the Moody's bond yield index. We expect hearings to occur this fall and proposed and final decisions by the end of the year. The new levels in mechanism would go into affect in January of 2013. ","And finally, this summer, we'll file the notice of intent for our next General Rate Case. We'll provide you details of our expense and capital requests at that time. And as a reminder, the GRC addresses electric and gas distribution and electric generation, and it will go into effect in 2014. Our next Gas Transmission & Storage case is a year later.","Now moving over to operations. Obviously, we continue to perform important gas work this year. Building up the extraordinary work completed in 2011, this quarter, the gas team continued to deliver impressive results. Even with the limitations of working on the system during the winter, when gas demand is much higher, we completed several miles of hydrostatic tests in the first quarter, and that's on our way to the planned performance of hydrostatic tests on another 160 miles during the remainder of this year. ","We also made significant progress on our efforts to validate and document the Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure of our pipelines. We completed about 900 miles in Q1 out of 3,600 miles planned for the entire year. In addition, as we performed fieldwork and identify emerging issues, we will continue to shift the pipeline work plan to ensure that the work of the -- at the highest safety priority is completed. ","In the area of nuclear operations, Diablo Canyon Unit 1 began its regularly scheduled refueling outage about 2 weeks ago, and the outage is progressing as scheduled. Now although we don't -- we have not experienced similar issues at Diablo Canyon, we do recognize there is currently a lot of focus on the steam generators at San Onofre, so I'll offer some comments pertaining to our Diablo Canyon plan. ","As you may recall, we replaced the steam generators and all the associated tubing several years ago. They have since then passed the rigorous one-year inspection, demonstrating very strong performance. In addition, our steam generators are of a different design and were sourced from a different manufacturer. Nonetheless, we continue to monitor them and with the next more detailed inspection of the steam generator tubing scheduled for 2014 and 2015 for the 2 units. Obviously, both San Onofre and Diablo Canyon are important resources for California, and we'll continue to monitor Edison's findings and apply any lessons learned from San Onofre to Diablo Canyon.","Shifting gears, we recently reached a milestone in our long-term commitment to resolve the chromium exposure in the groundwater at Hinkley. We were supplying residents in the area with bottled water, and we've established a program that offers eligible residents a set of alternatives, including a whole house water replacement system or the choice to sell us their property. Primarily as a result of this program, we took a charge for $71 million for environmental-related cost this quarter. We have not changed the overall estimate of cost related to the ultimate resolution of all the chromium-related issues previously provided. Resolving the whole house water issue addresses a significant component of our obligations to the community of Hinkley. The most notable remaining issue, which is the final remediation plan, is expected to be resolved late this year or early next year.","Moving on to overall performance. We continue to focus on our highest priorities of safe, reliable, affordable, customer-focused electric and gas service. You'll see our high-level operational performance focus areas described in Exhibit 7 in the Appendix. We place greater emphasis than ever before on safety in operational performance, specifically adopting measures that tie to public safety, employee safety, customer service and financial performance. ","For each of these measures, we have developed quarterly and annual targets based on improving our performance and ultimately, over the years, providing first quartile utility service. In some areas, such as nuclear operations, we already meet first quartile benchmarks, and the year-end goal is to maintain that level of performance. In other areas, the year-end goal is to improve performance by a specified percentage as part of a multiyear plan to provide exceptional levels of service. ","Our first quarter results show we're exceeding year-to-date performance targets in nuclear operations, gas leak performance and emergency response. We're meeting performance targets in gas reliability, and we need to improve our performance to achieve our targets for employee safety, customer satisfaction, electrical liability and the outages caused by downed wires. As 2012 progresses, our goal is to show improvement in each one of these areas. ","With that, I'll turn it over to Kent.","Kent M. Harvey","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everybody. I'm going to walk you through the results for the first quarter, and then I'll cover our outlook for the rest of 2012. ","Our Q1 results are summarized on Slide 4, and earnings from operations for the quarter were $372 million or $0.89 per diluted common share. GAAP results for the quarter were $233 million or $0.56 per share. The difference between earnings from operations and GAAP reflects the items impacting comparability for natural gas matters and for environmental-related costs at Hinkley. ","The item related to natural gas matters totaled $0.23 per share for the quarter, and the components of that are delineated in the table at the bottom. First is the pipeline-related costs, which totaled $104 million pretax during Q1. So this includes the strength testing and the pipeline validation work as well as our legal costs incurred during the quarter. And most of this work was generally on plan for the quarter, although legal costs exceeded plan due to an upswing in activity. Below that, you see that there were no additional accruals during the quarter related to potential penalties stemming from the various gas matters. And you remember in Q4 of last year, we accrued $200 million for potential penalties, which represented the low end of a range of possible outcomes. Of course, we'll continue to assess the accrual in future quarters until the issues are resolved. ","The next component is the $70 million pretax charge we took during the quarter for the contribution we made to the city of San Bruno, and Tony mentioned in his remarks the importance of reaching this agreement with the city. Next, you can see there also were no additional accruals during the quarter for third-party liability claims, and to date, we've accrued the total of $375 million for third-party liability related to the accident. And then finally, we booked insurance recoveries of $11 million in Q1, and that brings us to $110 million of insurance recovery since the accident. We'll continue to wait until we've resolved claims with each carrier before booking future recoveries. ","In the table at the top, you can see that in addition to the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters, we also took a charge for environmental-related costs at Hinkley totaling $0.10 per share. This accrual represents the expected costs associated providing the whole house water option that Chris described, and is in line with our original guidance range of 0 to $0.14 for the year. ","Now Slide 5 has the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations, and the $0.89 that we earned in the first quarter, which is shown on the far right, represents a $0.31 increase compared to Q1 of 2011. Most of that increase is due to unusual items in the first quarter of last year rather than activity in the most recent quarter. So for example, in Q1 last year, we were still waiting for final approval of the General Rate Case and the Gas Transmission & Storage case. So $0.14 of this quarter's increase is because we weren't able to book the associated revenues in Q1 last year. As a reminder, because we booked the catch-up revenues in Q2 of last year, you should expect to see a similar item but in reverse when we discuss our second quarter results a few months from now.","Next, $0.07 of the increase is due to lower outage restoration cost in comparison to last year, when we had an unusually severe winter storm season. And $0.05 cents relates to lower litigation and regulatory cost compared to last year, in large part because the prior period included an accrual for the Rancho Cordova accident.","We had a $0.05 increase due to higher authorized rate base investments this year compared to last year. We also picked up $0.02 in gas transmission revenues and $0.07 in miscellaneous, most of which includes a number of small items that we expect will reverse by the end of the year. These increases were partially offset by a reduction of $0.06 related to the planned incremental spending we've undertaken to improve our operational performance and $0.03 dilution for higher shares outstanding. And by the way, you should expect a larger impact from dilution in future quarters. And this is in part because we issued $250 million of equity late in Q1, so it's full effect wasn't felt in the quarter.","Now our guidance for the year is summarized on the next slide, and you can see at the top that there's no change in our guidance range for earnings from operations. That remains at $3.10 to $3.30 per share. Some of the key assumptions that underlie our 2012 guidance, such as authorized rate base, capital expenditure levels, the incremental expenses we expect to incur and our authorized ROE and cap structure, those are all provided in Exhibit 3 in the appendix. The guidance range for the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters has been updated basically to reflect the accrual made in Q1 for the contribution to the city of San Bruno and the proceeds we received from insurance providers during the quarter. ","So moving to the bottom part of the slide, you can see in the table that we're maintaining the range of $450 million to $550 million for pipeline-related cost for the year, although we are trending towards the upper end of that range. And while our fieldwork is generally on track fairly early in the year, our legal costs have risen significantly as the pace and scope of discovery and other activities have picked up more rapidly than we expected. So we'll continue to monitor this trend, and we'll provide an update on our next call.","The range for third-party liability claims remains unchanged at 0 to $225 million. And this range, again, just reflects the difference between what we've already accrued to date, $375 million and then the upper end of our estimate for third-party liability, which is $600 million. As in past quarters, we're not providing guidance for additional penalties beyond what we've already accrued or for future insurance recoveries. ","Back to the table at the top, you can see our guidance for the item impacting comparability for environmental-related costs. The upper end of the range is unchanged at $0.14. The lower end of the range reflects the $71 million pretax charge we took in Q1 associated with the whole house water replacement program.","So I'll finish up with our updated plans for equity issuance in 2012, and that's on Slide 7. On our last call, I indicated based on various guidance assumptions, we expected to issue roughly $600 million of equity this year, and that estimate is shown on the left. Next to that, you can see that we've increased our expectation for equity issuance this year by about $100 million. So our new estimate is roughly $700 million based on our guidance assumptions. The primary driver for the increase is the contribution we made to the city of San Bruno during the quarter as well as the trend towards the higher end of the range of our pipeline-related cost.","Moving to the right in the chart, you'll see that we actually issued a significant portion of that, almost $400 million, in the first quarter. This includes about $60 million to our internal programs, our DRIP and 401(k); about $80 million to our Dribble Program; and then about $250 million through the block equity offering we undertook in March. That allowed us to prefinance some of our equity needs for the year and provides us more flexibility pending resolution of the various gas issues. Our remaining need based on our guidance assumption is roughly $300 million, which is shown on the right. Obviously, our actual issuance during the year will depend on the resolution of the gas matters as well as other factors.","So with that, we're going to open up the lines for your questions, and then Tony will provide some closing remarks following Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Can you give us any incremental -- 2 questions. One, can you give us any incremental sort of guidance on how you -- on whether you feel you'll be able to bring the majority of the pipeline legal matters to a close this year through settlement, or whether you feel like you're going to have to litigate through the -- these sort of 3 to 4 separate paths? And the second question is, when we look at the Slide 7, with the $300 million of remaining equity needs, is that inclusive of equity that you need to issue in the course of normal operations to fund capital spending? Or is that exclusive of equity you need to fund ongoing operations?","Anthony F. Earley","Greg, this is Tony. Let me take the first part of the question. I'll let Kent handle the second. So what we know is that some of the parties have indicated both directly and indirectly through other people that they are interested in settlement of these regulatory proceedings. And we've said very clearly we're interested in settling those regulatory proceedings, because we think that's the fastest path to closure. But I do want to be clear that we have not had substantive discussions at this point, and obviously, those discussions, if and when they do begin, are sensitive. So we won't be able to comment on them until we finish with those discussions. So I think that's kind of the status that I can provide you.","Kent M. Harvey","And Greg, this is Kent. In terms of the $300 million of remaining equity need, that is what we expect to need for the end of the year based on our various guidance assumptions. So it is inclusive of needs that are driven by our CapEx program as well as our gas expenditures. And you should remember that for the $300 million remaining need, a good portion of that will be met through our normal internal programs, our (401)k and DRIP.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right. And when I think about 2013 -- and I know you haven't given guidance on any financial matters for '13. But should we presume that when we think about costs that roll over into '13, we should think about a similar funding profile? That -- to the extent you have pipeline-related matters, the O&M expenses that you expect to incur, that you would also need to fund them pro rata with equity in addition to your ongoing capital spending?","Kent M. Harvey","Well, Greg, yes. I mean the same factors potentially could influence us next year as influence us this year. So obviously, our CapEx program, which is significant this year, that is one driver of our equity needs, and I would expect that we'd continue to have the healthy CapEx program next year. I would also say we are incurring a lot of unfunded gas expenditures right now, and to the extent we continue to have unfunded gas expenditures next year, that would be a driver of equity needs. And I would say one significant issue next year compared to this year is just that obviously, there's been bonus depreciation both last year and this year, and it's not clear that that's going to be the case next year. So that will be another driver that you should keep in mind.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Two questions. One, balance sheet you'll put out later today when you file the Q, but could you just give high level in terms of where you sit right now in terms of cash balances and in terms of equity ratios Holdco and Opco?","Kent M. Harvey","Michael, this is Kent. In terms of our equity ratio, of course, what we focus on equity ratio-wise is the way it's measured for regulatory purposes. So that excludes our short-term debt, and I would expect that we would be very close to our 52% common equity overall. And our cash balances are down somewhat from the end of the year and comparable to the year before at this time. I think they're a little bit over $1 billion in terms of short-term borrowings, which is what we'd normally expect.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Meaning short-term borrowings is around $1 billion. And how much was the cash balance?","Kent M. Harvey","Yes. I don't know that there's a significant -- I think about $600 million of the cash balance in short-term borrowings and normally in that range, so a little over $1 billion.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And Tony, when you think about the issues in resolving the various pipeline dockets, is there one particular -- of the 3 or 4 dockets outstanding, is there one particular docket you think will be the most challenging to reach settlements on? And if so, what are the 2 or 3 biggest reasons why?","Anthony F. Earley","No, I think while they all focus on different issues, if we can get into settlement discussions, which we've said we'd want to, I don't think it's -- we're going to be able to distinguish where one is going to be harder than another. What we would like to do is have a comprehensive settlement. So I don't see that one could be singled out as harder than the other. I think it will be hard. As I said, the spirit is willing on trying to get settlement discussions, but whether we actually can get there and get it all wrapped up, we'll see over the next couple of months.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","One question I had on the sixth sense that you called out as being the incremental work, should we think about that as lining up quite cleanly with the $200 million annual numbers that you've been guiding to?","Anthony F. Earley","Yes, Jonathan. It's essentially the first quarter component of the $200 million.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So it's obviously looking like it's not quite 1\/8 or I guess 1\/4 of $200 million?","Anthony F. Earley","Yes. But it's the first quarter of the year, and there are some seasonal dimensions to our work plan.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So can you give us a flavor of what the seasonality might be as we look in the next -- is it going to be more weighted to the middle of the year, more weighted to the end?","Anthony F. Earley","I don't think there'll be dramatic differences among the quarters.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And as you progressed with this, are you still confident that this is $200 million of items that won't recur beyond 2013? Or is -- are you getting your arms around the workflow more?","Anthony F. Earley","Jonathan, when we identified this incremental spend of about $200 million to this year and next year, I think we indicated that about 1\/3 of the work is essentially work that we wanted to accelerate from multiyear plans to a shorter time frame, this year or next year. And so you would expect that that component, we would try to complete during the 2-year time frame, but the remainder is work that we wanted to take to another level, that we anticipate is a higher level of operations.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So therefore would continue beyond '13?","Anthony F. Earley","Yes.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then on another -- could -- Tony, you'd mentioned you had some progress on civil cases. Could you be a bit more specific about how many cases have been settled, how many outstanding or any other color you can give us there?","Anthony F. Earley","Yes. We have not been providing specific numbers. I will tell you we have settled some cases in the last quarter. Kent gave you the insurance numbers on them, but as we work through these individual cases, we'd prefer not to give specific numbers right now.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And if I may, I have just one other item. I noticed that you'd been -- you're supporting this bill in the Senate, Bill 971, that would exclude large-scale hydro from the sales denominator on the 33% renewables. Can you talk a little bit about your views on the prospects for that legislation? And secondly, how impactful would it be to your investment plans?","Anthony F. Earley","The reason why I think it's important is to give people an understanding of the high quality portfolio that we have on the generation side. I mean, one of the things that struck me coming to California, I kept hearing, \"Well, PG&E is at 20% renewables.\" We're actually over 40% renewables, and if you take into account our nuclear, over 50% of our generation is from non-emitting sources. And I think we and the policymakers need to understand how much progress we've made. So I think by eliminating the large hydro, which are excluded from the formula for the renewables mandate -- and I understand why it was excluded, because at the time, we wanted to stimulate new investment in renewables, but it is renewable nonetheless. The irony is that we're expanding some of our large hydro plants, and incremental megawatts count, the base megawatts don't. So I mean it illustrates that it's kind of artificial. In terms of the prospects, I don't know. I think we've -- it's been received well. People understand what we're trying to do. We're not trying to change the renewables mandate. We just want to have more clarity over how much progress we've made.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And if it was to pass, would it -- how -- what would it mean for the CapEx plan?","Anthony F. Earley","Oh, it wouldn't have any impact on the CapEx plan. It doesn't change, I think, where we're going.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just on the insurance front, you have still slow collections. Is there a view of when that could can pick up as far as reversing cash? And can you remind how that might affect the equity ratio that you guys have laid out so far?","Kent M. Harvey","Well, Dan, what happens, obviously, is we resolve issues eventually with our insurance providers once we've actually settled a lot of the claims, and so it will follow the third-party liability claims resolution. And it's hard to tell exactly what that pace is going to be. I think there is a fair amount of potential activity in the coming quarter in terms of the legal process, and the degree of success we have there will be one key driver about when insurance will follow. But it isn't unusual to see a significant lag between insurance recovery and settlement of the third-party liability claims.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And you guys are funding those third-party claims effectively with the equity raised this year with the assumption of not getting recovery. So when the money does come in, it will help mitigate some future equity needs?","Kent M. Harvey","That's correct. It's an interim issue for us.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Good. And I guess just a couple of, actually, operational questions, as crazy as that may sound. With the SONGS issues kind of facing Southern California, how do you guys see that affecting your system this summer? And is there any concern about reliability concerns creeping up your direction?","Christopher P. Johns","Yes. This is Chris Johns. Dan, it's a good question in that that's a significant and vital resource for California in general. But most of it, from what we've seen, is going to be more localized effects in Southern California. We don't see any impacts on us as far as reliability or resources in Northern California. Obviously, we're following it pretty closely, but from a supply and reliability aspect, we believe in our service territory, we ought to be fine.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, Chris, if you look at kind of balancing out the proposed lower ROE, the drop in natural gas fuel costs against higher renewable expenses, where do you guys see electricity rates going next year or the year after from those inputs you can look at right now?","Christopher P. Johns","Yes. When we look out over the next couple of years, we still feel pretty good around maintaining rates around the level of inflation growth on a year-to-year basis. I think that we still are focused a few years down the road on the impact of some of the renewables as they start to come online and the -- and what they'll do to our rates, and that's something that we're working through with both regulators and policymakers on how do we really make sure that the rate system is set up for the best for our customers. But over the next couple of years, you mentioned some of the good things that put downward pressure on rates, but obviously, we still have a lot of investment in the infrastructure of the system that we need to make, and we do need to get in compliance with the renewables as they come online. So it should balance out over the next couple of years to keep us right around the inflationary rate.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Does the step-up in rates kind of coincide with the next GRC? Is that the timing we should be thinking about comping [ph] the renewables impacts more?","Christopher P. Johns","It's -- yes. I mean, that time frame is probably not bad. It's a couple of years out when a lot of the renewables come on in bigger chunks, and that probably is right around the same time as when our General Rate Case will kick in.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein & Company.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","My question is around the PSEP CapEx and the OIR. If I understood correctly, you don't expect the OIR to be resolved until September, and you won't know, consequently, until then whether the full PSEP CapEx will be included in rate base or whether some portion will be disallowed. And my question in this are on the financing and the accounting for the PSEP CapEx. I assume until the OIR is decided that you're funding that as if it were included in rate base with the normal equity ratio. If that assumption turns out to be too optimistic and some portion of the CapEx is disallowed, you would then write off that CapEx and issue incremental equity that cover the write-down. Is that right or wrong?","Kent M. Harvey","Hugh, this is Kent. I think, generally, that's directionally right. In other words, we are essentially financing that CapEx, which really is just beginning, because we've been in the winter months, but we are financing that with the weighted cost of -- weighted capital structure. And then we do -- in our guidance, we assume that essentially, the annual costs associated with that capital, the carrying costs essentially is part of our earnings guidance for the $450 million to $550 million. It's a small component of the overall expense.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin with Citigroup.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Any quick thoughts or reactions on the citation decision? I mean, we got the board's recent decision, and thoughts on how the company should best proceed with that program going forward.","Anthony F. Earley","Well, I think we were disappointed in that decision, because the principle of assigning maximum penalties for self-identified violations just is not consistent with regulatory practices in many agencies. But that said, we'll continue our discussions with the CPUC on how we might modify that approach, but that one particular proceeding, it's behind us right now.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then on a separate issue, just going back to the bonus depreciation question, any sort of quick stab on the year-over-year effect of that? Trying to quantify that somehow, Kent?","Kent M. Harvey","Well, I think we indicated for this year that the bonus depreciation allows us to do some incremental CapEx given that our rates were fixed in our last General Rate Case, and that incremental amount for the year was roughly about $600 million. So you can essentially see the headroom that was created through bonus depreciation. And you'll remember in our case, the PUC allowed us to set up a memorandum account in order to try to utilize that headroom for the benefits of customers with incremental infrastructure investment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski, Macquarie Group.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","You mentioned the high-profile hires for your gas business. How should we think about it from a cost perspective? Is it going to be covered under your GRC that you're supposed to issue notice for this summer? Or is that already the Gas Transmission Rate Case, which will be filed on the following year?","Anthony F. Earley","Yes. I mean, I think the incremental cost of our hires in the overall scheme of things is in the rounding. Some of the positions were positions where we're backfilling. Some of them were new positions as part of the reorganization, but I don't think it has any bottom line impact in the long term.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Okay. And secondly, about the reset of allowed ROEs and the equity ratio. You mentioned that currently, you have about a 52% equity ratio. What happens if the -- if there's a reduction in that equity ratio and you have already issued equity? So you're basically -- in a way, you are starting from a higher level of the equity ratio than the allowed one.","Kent M. Harvey","Well, in that scenario, obviously, we would need to true up our equity so that it matches the authorized ratios. In reality, of course, the proceeding is going to take place during this year, and I'm hopeful that we'll have some view whether or not that's truly a controversial issue at the commission or not. I continue to believe that the 52% makes a lot of sense for us. And while simplistically, some of our observers have noted that our common equity ratio was higher than the other utilities -- although frankly, I think Sempra is looking to raise their common equity ratio to look more like ours. But particularly with respect to Edison, that's more like 58%. It's important that people also recognize that Edison has a lot more preferred stock than we have. And as a result, we end up at the same place from a credit perspective overall, which is really the purpose of having the right balance for your capital structure. And we have looked at the alternatives of issuing a lot more preferred stock and having less common stock outstanding, and it is essentially equivalent from a cost perspective of our customers, given our credit ratings and our expected cost of issuance. So we think we have a capital structure that makes sense. And especially given the fact that S&P downgraded us in recent months, we don't think that increasing leverage makes sense for us right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I believe in February you had mentioned about $230 million that you expect to at least apply for recovery. I was wondering how comfortable you are with that and the pipeline costs number after the initial regulatory proceedings.","Kent M. Harvey","Travis, I think what you're referring to maybe was within the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan, the portion that was -- that we were seeking recovery for. Because you remember, in the overall program, there were some components, particularly for newer pipe, that we were not going to seek recovery of. We right now are challenged in terms of actually achieving that recovery this year just given the fact that the proceeding is still underway, and we're having -- we're beginning to incur those costs. So until that proceeding gets resolved, we won't have more confidence about actually achieving that level for this year. We do hope to seek recovery -- once the decision is made, we hope we do obtain recovery for all those costs that are associated with new requirements, and we're hopeful that the commission will move expeditiously to resolve the proceeding.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. But you're still comfortable with that $230 million as of now?","Kent M. Harvey","Yes. I think the split -- we might have adjusted slightly, but it's not a dramatic difference.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And then remind me, you mentioned it, but how much of the $230 million has been spent to date?","Kent M. Harvey","It's fairly modest. And we have not broken out, out of our total pipeline-related costs, the specific amount that would be part of the PSEP.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan [ph] with Visium Asset Management.","Unknown Analyst","Yes. My questions have been answered.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Bank of America.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of questions. First, on the OIR case, the -- where do you stand on addressing the gas distribution side of the business?","Kent M. Harvey","Steve, this is Kent. The -- in the rule making, the gas distribution is not really a part of it. That's focused on the pipeline.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. But I think it's been brought up in terms of addressing that as well at some point. Is that...","Christopher P. Johns","Yes. This is Chris, and right now, that would be addressed through our General Rate Case. We're still continuing to look and work with the CPUC to see if there is a different forum for addressing that. But as of right now, our plan would be to include that kind of a program in our filing this year on our General Rate Case.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then on the remaining equity for this year, any sense on what -- how you are likely to do that and maybe related to how much is left on the dribble plan?","Kent M. Harvey","Yes. The dribble program, I can't remember the number right now. We do have some left on that, and that's, of course, easy for us to renew, which we have done in the past. So the dribble program can be very flexible for us and allow us to do it rateably as we go. But I indicated earlier of the $300 million, we'll get a chunk of that through our internal programs. And so the remainder we can handle through a dribble or any other alternatives that are out there, and we're really going to kind of see what make sense at the time given the situation.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then one last question. I think during this quarter, you got a court ruling on the Oakley plant. Could you update us on that and kind of what's next?","Thomas E. Bottorff","Yes. This is Tom Bottorff from Regulatory Relations. We have refiled an application to seek approval of the Oakley plant. That was filed on March 30 of 2012. So we asked for expedited treatment. We hope we get a decision this year, but it may be delayed until the following year.","Operator","There are currently no additional questions waiting from the phone lines.","Anthony F. Earley","Well, this is Tony. Let me just wrap up the discussion this morning. The next several months are going to be very important and challenging for the company. As we work to bring to a close the various San Bruno regulatory proceedings, we're going to see a whole new round of public discussion about the tragedy that, quite honestly, will not put the company in a favorable light, because we'll review all of those issues. But I've told our team here that that's part of the closure process and that we can't let that distract us from moving forward with the plan. The good news is that we will be much closer to giving closure to the victims, to the public and to all of our constituents so that PG&E can focus on a bright future for the company. So I thank you all for joining us this morning, and I look forward to talking to you in the future.

Togneri","Thank you, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Before you hear from Tony Earley, Chris Johns and Kent Harvey, let me give you the usual reminders, and that being the discussion today will include forward-looking statements that are based on assumptions and expectations reflecting information currently available to management. Some of the important factors that could affect the company's results are described in Exhibit 1 that's located in the appendix for today's slides. And we also encourage you to review the discussion of risk factors that appears in the 2012 Annual Report and in the Form 10-K, both of which will be filed with the SEC later today. And with that, I'll hand it over to Tony.","Anthony F. Earley","So good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We have a lot to cover this morning starting with our results over the past year, and then we'll discuss our outlook for 2013 and beyond. I'll begin and then turn it over to Chris and Kent.","Our focus continues to be on the areas that I outlined at the beginning of last year, resolving gas issues, positioning the company for long-term success and rebuilding relationships and partnering effectively with stakeholders. We've made significant progress in all of these areas in the last year. As you know, we've been working diligently to resolve the outstanding gas issues. Unfortunately, we reached an impact in settlement discussions with the other parties in the investigations, and we're now moving forward with the scheduled regulatory proceedings. We're committed to bringing this to a conclusion that is fair to all the parties involved including our shareholders. Since the San Bruno accident, we've spent 1.4 billion in shareholder dollars on unrecovered pipeline-related expenses and capital investment. And the total cost is $1.9 billion when we add the charge we've taken related to potential penalties, the contribution we made to the City of San Bruno and the incremental work we've done to improve our performance across the utility.","While the investigations remain undecided, we are well on the path to resolving many of the other issues. The decision on the pipeline safety enhancement plan was an important step forward in closing out some of the cost uncertainties. While the result was not what we originally had in mind, it was an improvement over the proposed decision. We've also continued to make substantial progress on third-party liabilities. We've settled all of the most serious cases, and we're now focused on resolving the remaining cases. As a result of this settlement, the judge in the case recently took the trial off the court's calendar and encouraged the parties to continue settlement discussions on the remaining cases, and we continue to receive insurance payments.","As we reported to you each quarter, we've also made substantial progress on gas operational needs. One area where our assessment is not complete is the encroachment issue on our gas pipeline rights of way, but we are including a range of costs in our guidance today and Kent will get to that later. We continue to be focused on that issue, as well as resolving CPUC and criminal investigations. We're starting to transition from the uncertainties of the past couple of years and we have taken steps to position the company for long-term success. As I've mentioned before, we've adopted a more rigorous multiyear planning process, which has put us on a positive trajectory towards operational and financial success. As part of our planning process, we established key operating metric target at the beginning of last year and we closed the year with strong performance against those metrics. Our continuous improvement program is up and running, and we filed our 2014 General Rate Case application, which is intended to re-baseline the company's distribution and generation operations. Our objective is to execute well on the programs outlined in the GRC, enabling us to earn our authorized return in 2014 with the exception of the Gas Transmission business.","As I've said since arriving at PG&E, we can't rebuild our company without also rebuilding relationships and being a trusted partner. The first step is with meeting our operational commitments. In 2012, for the second year in a row, we executed an unprecedented level of gas work and we've gotten much better at communicating with our stakeholders about the work that we're doing. We've been collaborating with public officials in Sacramento on important policy issues such as residential electric rates and greenhouse gas emissions. We're also improving our relationships with the cities and towns across our service territory. Last year, we piloted an initiative to strengthen our local PG&E presence, and we're so pleased with the result that we're expanding those pilots across our system. In addition, the customer outreach and education effort that we won in 2012 is delivering results. We're seeing strong momentum in our customer satisfaction survey scores, and our brand favorability numbers have moved up sharply, but we recognize that relationships with our customers are still fragile. To continue to earn back their trust, we simply have to keep our focus on improving the safety and reliability of our system and our service. We believe that delivering strong operational results for our customers will lead to strong financial results over time.","So now I'm going to turn things over to Chris, who will cover the regulatory and the operational items in a little more detail. Chris?","Christopher P. Johns","Thanks, Tony. First, I'll start with our regulatory activity. In December of 2012, we saw resolution of several significant cases at the CPUC. First, the commission voted out the cost of capital case resulting in a 10.4% return on equity for 2013 and a capital structure of 52% equity. In addition, last month, the parties filed a settlement that would essentially extend the previous adjustment mechanism through the end of 2015. The CPUC also approved our application for the Oakley generating station, a 586-megawatt high-efficiency gas plant to be built in Contra Costa County. We expect to take ownership of the facility from the developer some time in 2016 or 2017. Also in December, the CPUC awarded us $21 million in energy efficiency incentive revenues associated with the successful results of our 2010 customer energy efficiency programs. As you know, the CPUC also voted out our pipeline safety enhancement plan, or PSEP. Although the vote provides certainty on how the plan will be implemented, the punitive disallowance is disappointing. The PSEP decision and the current gas transmission rate case remain in effect through the end of 2014 and will incorporate future pipeline spending in the 2015 Gas Transmission rate case.","Looking at significant regulatory items in 2013. As Tony mentioned, we filed our $1.28 billion application for the 2014 General Rate Case in December. The administrative law judge on that case has approved a schedule that, if followed, would allow the case to be resolved by the end of this year. As part of this rate case, we are participating in a new CPUC process where a third party performs an independent safety overview of our filing. We also filed our Transmission Owner Case, or TO 14, with the FERC and refiled the application at the end of the year under order from FERC staff to use a much lower return on equity. We have filed a request for rehearing as we believe the resulting ROE is insufficient to attract capital.","Moving on to operations. 2012 was a very busy year across the entire company as we executed on our plans to enhance the safety and reliability of our system. In the gas business, in 2012, we completed pressure tests on 175 miles of pipeline. This level of strength testing in a single year on pipes already in service exceeds anything any other utility has done before. We also replaced 40 miles of pipe and installed 46 remote or automatic shutoff valves across the system. This year, we will complete our comprehensive validation of the Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure on all of our gas transmission pipelines. As you know, we have brought in an experienced gas leadership team and tasked them with ensuring that we have a safe and reliable system. As part of their evaluation, they've identified additional work related to integrity management requirements and maintaining pipeline rights of way across our system, both of which we've discussed with you in the past.","On the integrity management side, we've made some changes to our risk assessment methodology to better align with leading practices. So for example, we've strengthened our procedures associated with identifying manufacturing and construction defects in the internal corrosion on our pipes. We're now incorporating assessment and testing for these and other potential challenges into our integrity management program, where we'll also use the information for asset management and investment planning. Much of this work was not included in our last gas transmission rate case. The cost for the work we do this year and next will not be recovered, but we do plan to include this enhanced integrity management approach in our request for the next gas transmission case starting in 2015.","With regard to the encroachment on our rights of way and the necessary mitigation we'll have to undertake, we're conducting a detailed survey to ascertain the exact coordinates of the pipeline within the rights of way across our entire service area. We expect to complete this survey later this year. Meanwhile, we've relied on aerial photography and other inputs to develop preliminary cost estimates. Our information thus far confirms that the encroachments are numerous and significant and because this issue arises from our ineffective patrolling in the past, we will not be able to recover these costs and rates. We expect the total cost for this right-of-way work to be on the order of $500 million over the next 5 years. Obviously, this is a significant cost, but it's work we're committed to get done and to get done effectively and efficiently.","Shifting gears, we're really pleased with the work being done to provide reliable customer service in the electric operations and in energy supply. For example, in electric operations, installing smart grid technology such as intelligent switches on more than 100 distribution circuits helped us reach record reliability for PG&E for the fourth year in a row. While we're not yet at the first quartile level we aspire to be, our consistent improvements give me confidence that we're making good progress in that direction. At Diablo Canyon, we had another year of strong performance on safety in operations and ended the year with a 90% capacity factor overall. And earlier this month, we began a regularly scheduled refueling outage on Unit 2. Finally, we continue to progress on the renewables area and are on target to meet our commitment of having 33% renewable power by 2020. However, as part of that process, we have decided not to continue with our utility-owned solar PV program after this year as we are getting better pricing for our customers through competitive bidding.","We're seeing the results of our focus on operations in planned incremental spending and capital investments, all of which continue in 2013. This year, the additional capital spending will support things like consolidating our electric and gas distribution control centers and installing more sophisticated technology. We believe it makes sense to continue these efforts going into the next General Rate Case given our progress in improving our operations across the board. Our customers are responding in these efforts. Last year, our customer satisfaction survey results were the highest they've been since 2009. This reflects our customers' appreciation for our team's commitment to restoring power quickly and safely. And with that, I'll turn things over to Kent.","Kent M. Harvey","Thanks, Chris, and good morning. I plan to briefly go through Q4 and 2012 results and then spend most of my time on guidance going forward.","Slide 4 summarizes the results for the quarter and the full year. Earnings from operations were $0.59 for the quarter and $3.22 for the year. GAAP results are also shown here and reflect the items impacting comparability for natural gas matters and for environmental-related costs. The natural gas item is laid out in pretax dollars in the table at the bottom. Pipeline-related costs came in at $106 million pretax for the quarter and $477 million for the year, well within our guidance range of $450 million to $550 million. We had been trending towards the upper end of the range during much of the year but some of our expected legal costs were pushed into 2013 given delays on the pipeline investigations while settlement discussions were underway.","Importantly, during the quarter, we took a pretax charge of $353 million for the capital that was disallowed in connection with our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan. Going forward, we don't expect additional capital write-offs unless our costs trend higher than our current assumptions. During Q4, we accrued an additional $17 million for possible penalties related to the gas matters. Our original accrual of $200 million done in Q4 of 2011 included potential fines for missing maps in our gas leak survey program. Since those fines have been paid, we took an additional accrual in Q4 in order to restore the total accrual to $200 million. We continue to believe this represents the low end of the range for possible penalty. During the quarter, there were no additional accruals to third-party liability claims, but we did book additional insurance recovery for $50 million, which you see near the bottom. That brings total insurance recoveries to $185 million during 2012 and $284 million since the accident.","In terms of the items impacting comparability to environmental-related costs, which is back in the top part of the slide, we accrued an additional charge of about $0.02 per share in Q4, reflecting updated cost estimates related to property purchases and whole-house water replacement.","Slide 5 shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison of earnings from operations including the main drivers that take us from $0.89 in Q4 2011 to $0.59 in Q4 2012. And most of these drivers are consistent with the items we've seen in past quarters. Planned incremental work across the utility totaled $0.11 negative and employee incentive compensation accounted for a $0.09 difference since the annual incentive in the prior year was well below target. In addition, increased shares outstanding drove a $0.05 decline, storm costs and litigation costs reached $0.02 negative and we had various other items that together totaled $0.06 negative. A few of these items include somewhat lower awards for our energy efficiency programs when compared to the prior year and in lower tax settlements. These factors were partially offset by a $0.05 increase in rate base earnings compared to a year ago. In terms of our equity issuance, we issued a total of $775 million of common stock during the year, bringing our year-end share count to 431 million shares.","That's it for 2012 results and I'd now like to move on to our outlook going forward. I plan to walk through our guidance for 2013 and then I'll also provide some thoughts about 2014 and beyond.","As we've discussed before, 2013 is going to be a down year for us due to the impact of our lower authorized return, the additional dilution from share issuance year-over-year and our continued incremental spend across the utility prior to a reset in our 2014 General Rate Case. Let's start by going through some of the key assumptions in our guidance, which are shown on Slide 6. First, we're assuming capital expenditures for the year of a little over $5 billion, somewhat higher than last year's level, and you can see the key components of the planned CapEx on the left. We're also assuming an average authorized rate base of about $26 billion in 2013. This reflects past regulatory decisions like our 2011 General Rate Case, as well as pending proceedings such as our current electric transmission case with the FERC. The authorized return on equity for most of our rate base other than electric transmission is assumed to be the 10.4% that we recently received from the California PUC. However, we are assuming an ROE of only 9.1% on the electric transmission business for guidance purposes given where we currently are with the FERC on that issue. Our authorized equity ratio continues to be 52% across the board.","We assume that we'll continue to incur about $250 million of expenses across the utility in excess of levels authorized in recent rate cases in order to enhance the level of service we're providing customers. We requested recovery of most of these costs starting in 2014 in our next General Rate Case. There is roughly about $50 million of that total that relates to gas transmission, and that's expected to be incorporated in our next gas transmission case in 2015.","Because the CapEx program described will exceed levels authorized in our last General Rate Case and other proceedings by about $1 billion this year, we expect to incur some additional financing and depreciation expense that won't be recovered in 2013. We do anticipate truing up rate base in our upcoming General Rate Case to include recovery of most of these investments beginning in 2014.","As we've previously discussed, we expect our below-the-line costs in 2013 to fully offset CWIP earnings. So that's another assumption underlying our guidance. And as has been the case for the past couple of years, we continue to experience lower revenues for our gas storage business due to market conditions being less favorable than was assumed in our last gas transmission case. Roughly offsetting this last item is the assumption that we earn an incentive award for our customer energy efficiency program this year that approximates the one we earned late in 2012.","Turning to Slide 7, you'll see that these assumptions lead us to provide a guidance range for earnings from operations in 2013 of $2.55 to $2.75 per share. The primary drivers year-over-year are the reduction in authorized ROE for both the PUC and FERC jurisdictional assets, the additional dilution due to share issuance year-over-year, the impact of below-the-line costs which are expected to fully offset CWIP earnings as compared to partially offset in 2012, and then planned CapEx in excess of authorized levels. These factors are partially offset by the growth in authorized rate base.","Moving on to Slide 8, you can see our guidance for the item impacting comparability for gas matters in 2013. We're providing guidance for pipeline-related costs that we expect to incur but not recover during 2013 of $400 million to $500 million pretax. So let's go through each of those components. In terms of the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan, we wrote off the capital that was disallowed by the CPUC in Q4. So our guidance in 2013 includes the expenses that we expect to incur but not recover through rates. Our pretax guidance range for this component is $150 million to $200 million. In terms of the emerging work, we're looking at the cost to survey and begin clearing our pipeline rights of way and the higher level of activity we've undertaken on our integrity management program. Our pretax guidance for these emerging work categories is $175 million to $225 million. We expect the right-of-way work to represent more than half of this spend in 2013; as Chris indicated, to be carried out over a 5-year period. We do not expect to recover these costs for the rates. We'll continue to refine our estimates once we've completed the center line survey late in the year.","We expect the integrity management work to represent less than half of the spend in 2013 and to continue in future years. However, we plan to seek recovery of these ongoing costs beginning in 2015 in the next gas transmission case. Finally, we're showing a range of $50 million to $100 million for legal and other costs since some costs we planned in 2012 were pushed out with the delayed proceedings at the CPUC. We would expect these costs to decline significantly after this year. You'll notice also that the guidance range we're using for total pipeline-related cost is somewhat narrower than just the sum of the ranges for each period.","At the bottom of the slide are the other categories we've been tracking related to gas matters. As we've done in the past, we're not providing guidance for additional penalties coming out of the investigation and the range we show for third-party liabilities continues to reflect the difference between what we've accrued today, $455 million, and then the upper end of the estimate we've disclosed, which is $600 million. We're also not providing guidance for insurance recovery, but anticipate those to continue to follow from the resolution of the third-party claim.","On Slide 9, you can see our estimated equity issuance of $1 billion to $1.2 billion for 2013. This range is consistent with our guidance assumption and does not reflect any equity issuance that would result from fines greater than the $200 million we're already accrued.","Key factors driving our equity issuance in 2013 compared to 2012 are lower earnings from operations in 2013, somewhat higher CapEx and the PSEP capital charge at the end of last year. We'll continue to utilize various ways to raise equity efficiently and effectively including our dividend reinvestment 401(k) programs and our thermal [ph] program.","Slide 10 summarizes 2013 guidance including earnings from operations and the gas matters item. As you can see, we're also including a modest guidance range for environmental-related costs in connection with the Hinkley cleanup. The range here reflects some true-ups we may experience on our whole-house water program during the year, as well as habitat protection activities we may undertake. You'll remember we've already accrued the expected costs associated with our proposed final remedy to clean up the groundwater. Our guidance does not include additional cost in the event of more onerous final remedy this quarter.","I know many of you recognize that 2013 is an unusual year for us and you're interested in getting a read on what things might look like in 2014 and beyond. So while we're not providing earnings guidance beyond 2013 at this point, I do want to share with you our current view of our CapEx and our rate base going forward.","Slide 11 shows a range of estimated CapEx for 2014 through 2016. The upper end of the range provided for each year reflects the CapEx level included in our 2014 General Rate Case and attrition request. It also represents our current view of future regulatory requests for electric transmission and gas transmission. The lower end of the ranges reflect current spending levels across the utility with some adjustments for known changes such as the end of the Cornerstone Program and the utility Photovoltaic Program. I should also point out that we've excluded the recently approved Oakley generating project from the 2016 CapEx numbers shown here just in the interests of being conservative. Our turnkey purchase of that plant will occur when it's ready to go operational and that could be as early as 2016. The level of CapEx I've described would provide for significant growth over the next few years. And as you'd expect, we continue to issue a meaningful amount of equity to support this growth.","Slide 12 shows ranges for authorized rate base consistent with the CapEx numbers. Under these assumptions, average authorized rate base for 2014 ranges from $28.5 billion to $29 billion and would grow to between $32 billion and $35 billion in 2016. The compound growth rate over this period ranges from 6% to 10% excluding the Oakley plant.","These numbers reflect our intent in the 2014 General Rate Case to true up our rate base in order to reflect the higher CapEx we're undertaking this year. In addition, we hope to true up our revenues to recover most of the incremental expenses we've been incurring across the utility-approved service both last year and this year. As a result, our objective is to earn our authorized return from the nonpipeline segments of our business starting in 2014.","Slide 13 just addresses the fact that in future years, we still expect to incur some costs for gas pipeline work that will not be recovered. You already know that the PSEP decision did not sufficiently fund our planned expense work and that affects us through the end of 2014. After that, we anticipate incorporating our ongoing pipeline safety work into our 2015 gas transmission case. By then, there will be even more data to demonstrate the true cost of doing this work.","In terms of the emerging work, Chris mentioned that our current estimate for the right-of-way activities is roughly $500 million over 5 years. So we expect those unrecovered costs to continue through 2017. We also expect our enhanced integrity management program to continue next year and beyond. Though we won't recover those costs in 2014, we do plan to incorporate them into our 2015 gas transmission case.","And finally, we expect our legal costs to decline significantly in 2014. On this slide, we have not included things like third-party liabilities, insurance and penalties, and our objective is to resolve those as much as possible this year. Obviously, there may be some things that don't get fully wrapped up. We plan to continue to break out these costs so that you can keep track of the impact that they have on our GAAP results. I'm going to stop here. I know I've covered a lot. Hopefully, the information that we've covered today will be helpful to you in assessing our financial prospects going forward. Tony?","Anthony F. Earley","Thanks, Kent. Let me just reiterate some of the points from this morning's call. We weren't able to resolve all of the San Bruno issues last year as we had hoped to do, but we have resolved many of them, including the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan and much of the third-party liability and I'm pleased with that. Operationally, 2012 was a very productive year for us. We accomplished the work we set out to do and I'm proud of the employees who have been working hard toward our goal of becoming a safer, high-performing company. So challenges remain, our recovery is clearly underway, and our progress will continue in 2013. We have a good team in place, a solid fundamental operating plan and some successes under our belt. We're committed to becoming a high-performing gas and electric utility that our customers, regulators and shareholders deserve. So with that, let me open up the floor for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski from Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","I might have missed the statements about how much you've accrued for the potential penalty versus the $1 billion to $1.2 billion equity guidance. So your Slide 9 says that does not include potential penalties above the accrued level. So what's the accrued level?","Anthony F. Earley","The accrued level is $200 million.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Wow, so you're assuming that, that issuance is largely a function of basically unrecoverable expenses?","Anthony F. Earley","And our capital expenditure program.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Okay. And so -- okay. Now if you -- yes, I'm basically a little bit stunned that this is how much equity you would need in 2013. I would have assumed that this is partly a function of the penalty, but well in excess of the $200 million that you have already accrued for. But that's fine. Now can you talk a little bit more about the FERC transmission ROE? It seems extremely low.","Anthony F. Earley","Yes, we received a FERC staff order in our Transmission Owner Case that essentially ordered us to file with a 9.1% return on equity, so obviously something we don't think is adequate to attract capital. We think it's a very narrow way to actually consider what our true cost of equity is and we hope to be able to resolve it through some [indiscernible] discussions or else through the legal process, but that's going to take us a while to actually resolve. So we have assumed the 9.1% return on equity for the electric transmission component of our business in our 2013 guidance.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then lastly, the pipeline-related expenses, if I look beyond 2014 where you have your legal expenses significantly down, is it fair to assume that the only expense, unrecoverable expense, that I should assume is the right-of-way payment of roughly $100 million, say, '15, '16, '17?","Anthony F. Earley","Yes. If you look at Slide 13, it really kind of lays out the natural gas matters beyond 2013. And you can see most of those items we would be either completing the expenditures on are pursuing them through our normal pipeline rate case so it really is the right-of-way encroachment that is the multiyear item that we do not intend to pursue recovery of.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Leslie Rich with JPMorgan.","Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.","Just a couple of quick questions. Can you remind me the purchase price for Oakley when you do have to pay for it and it goes into rates?","Christopher P. Johns","This is Chris. We have not put out the price for Oakley. It is under a confidentiality agreement and we still have to negotiate some of the pieces of getting the contract completed. But what I can tell you is it's 586 megawatts. It is a modern facility. It is dry cooled and it is in California with all our related regulatory costs that go with that.","Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.","Okay. And then on your comment on solar, you said that you would not continue with utility-owned solar investments beyond this year. And I recall you had a solar program for x number of megawatts over a multiyear period. Was that scheduled to finish this year? Or are you building less than you had originally thought?","Christopher P. Johns","Leslie, we completed the first 3 years of a 5-year program so basically we're not completing the last 2 years and as I said in my prepared remarks, we're just seeing prices that are much better through the contracting process.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Dan Eggers with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Tony, just kind of on the OII proceedings and kind of the outlook given, the fact that the settlement talks fell apart a little while ago, is this something from your perspective that's going to have to go through the full regulatory process to come to conclusion? Or do you think there is leeway or interest in finding a workable solution for all the parties, given what you guys have been through so far?","Anthony F. Earley","Yes, we made it clear that we are open to settlement. As I've said time and again, we need to get these proceedings behind us. That said, we've got to get the other parties to the same position. Disappointed toward the end of last year, we thought we were getting very close and it became apparent that we weren't as close as we had hoped, but we made it clear to everyone, we're ready to sit down. But what I don't want to do is go into extended settlement discussions and defer resolution of the proceedings. As we saw from the PSEP proceeding, while the result wasn't what we had wanted, it is a result we know where we are, we had the plan approved and we can now move forward and deal with it. So it's almost more important to us to keep the proceedings moving to get them done. But that said, these settlements can occur very quickly if, in fact, we get all the parties agree and that's what we want to do.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then I guess on the encroachment issue, how did you guys come to the $500 million number you based on kind of what you surveyed so far? And how high is your confidence that's going to be the ultimate cost?","Christopher P. Johns","Dan, this is Chris again. Well, what we did is, as I said, we're going to go through a detailed center line project. But that project is going to take us through the end of this year to get completed. And so we wanted to be able to provide some overview of what we think the numbers would be. So we used a lot of our aerial photography capability to look over the lines and then we also used some inputs from testing that we've been doing over the last year, including some pilots that we had in place. And so what we tried to do was estimate based on what we've seen in the past, how many -- how much vegetation is out there around our lines, how many structures might be in and around them and then estimate what those costs would look like in doing that. And so as you can imagine, the large part of that $500 million is construction-type costs and vegetation management-type costs that are associated with that. So we feel like we've done a lot of due diligence around it. Obviously, we'll have to tweak it as we physically get out and walk the line to make sure, but we think we have a pretty good estimate there.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. I guess one last one. Kent, when you look at the range of CapEx, the high end to base case, can you just maybe help bucket a little bit more of that spend? How much of that is going to be pipeline-related versus electric transmission-related versus other stuff just so we can try and gauge the potential for the high versus low?","Kent M. Harvey","Dan, I think on the slide, we kind of at least for 2013 show our pipeline spend, broken out in the assumptions page, which was, I think, Slide 6. So you get a sense of our electric transmission CapEx for this year is about $800 million -- excuse me, are you saying electric or gas? I'm sorry.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Both actually.","Kent M. Harvey","Okay. Yes, that slide shows you kind of how much is electric transmission. It shows about $850 million and then you see the gas transmission, which is in the $350 million range. So those are kind of -- then you want to add the PSEP down below, which is $450 million, so there are comparable sizes for those 2 parts of our business.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Do you expect to continue at that rate? And does the sensitivity to that spending is going to affect the range?","Kent M. Harvey","Well, it's not exactly the same number in future years, but you'll see overall we are increasing, and those would be some part of those increases.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I'm just curious, I think Tony made the comment at the beginning that in 2014, you [indiscernible] earnings allowed return everywhere except the Gas Transmission business. And given that a lot of these merging were costs and other stuff so, if I'm understanding it rightly, are excluded from operating earnings, will you comment on the GAAP results or are there other things that are causing you not to earn that allowed return in '14?","Kent M. Harvey","Jonathan, this is Kent. In 2014, it's just that the GAAP pipeline profile is what it is. We're spending dollars in a lot of areas that weren't in our last Gas Transmission case. Our intent is, in 2015, to be able to true that up for the items other than the right-of-way work. And so that's really why 2015 is a really important year for us on the Gas Transmission business. The other lines of business, we would be addressing to our General Rate Case in 2014 and then our Transmission Owner Case for electric transmission, which we tend to do just about annually.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So it's really the integrity management and other work, or that's below the line kind of...","Kent M. Harvey","Well, the integrity management, you're right, we have been breaking out as a big, new category where we're spending a lot. But even within the Gas Transmission business, notwithstanding the item impacting comparability, I indicated that of our incremental spend across the utility of $250 million this year and last year, about $50 million of that is the Gas Transmission business. So that piece of the $250 million also wouldn't be trued up until 2015.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then on the equity, Kent, you've listed out the sort of various -- the drift, 401(k), dribble, can you just remind me what the reasonable expectations for how much you could raise through those programs collectively and at what level you'd be looking to step outside of those plans?","Kent M. Harvey","Well, if you look at our 2012 equity issuance, for example, which was $775 million, we did those in sort of 3 fairly equal pieces. So we got about 1\/3 of that through our internal programs, our drift on our 401(k). We got about 1\/3 of that through our dribble program and then the remaining 1\/3, about $250 million, we did through a block transaction early last year. So that's not to put a cap on how much you could do, for example, through the dribble program. That's just how much we did last year. And we're going to continue to evaluate the options that make sense for us given our profile and the timing and so forth in 2013. Obviously, one factor will be when and how the pipeline matters get additionally resolved.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","For sure, but I mean there's -- does it seem -- so is there a scenario where you could do the number you've put out? I guess the number's likely to be bigger, whatever, but is -- would you use the base assumptions from last year, about 2\/3 of last year's number through the programs and the rest of the block? Is that a good working assumption?","Kent M. Harvey","Yes. Jonathan, I think the key will be we'll probably get up to about $300 million to our internal programs, and we'd want to optimize the rest of our issuance. Undoubtedly, the dribble will be a significant component of that, but we're going to really use the various options that we have in the way that makes the most sense so that we can have issuance that is both efficient and effective.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Tony, as you know, I mean, the normal utility business model is you provide safe and reliable service, you get to invest a lot of capital doing it and you earn a nice return on that and then you pass through the operating cost to the customer. On the gas side, PG&E seems to be running kind of an anti-utility where the service isn't safe and reliable. You spend a lot of capital trying to catch up on the safety and incur a lot of integrity management costs and then you just write it off. It's kind of like burning $100 bills. How confident are you that this is over now or do you fear that there could be other items like the right-of-way clearance that are still looming ahead and might limit your ability to recover capital and operating costs in the future?","Anthony F. Earley","Well, we're clearly playing catch-up in investing in the system, but I think we're starting to see certainty emerge. So for example, Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan, as we said, went through the proceeding. We had proposed that we recover about 85% of the plan. Some of the interveners in the case said, \"No, you ought to recover nothing.\" We ended up in a 60% range or so, which is less than we want, but it gives us some certainty about what we are going to recover going forward in the future. In terms of what other expectations, one of the things that we've done is we've reviewed -- or in the process of reviewing, every single aspect of our gas business, kind of divided the system into asset classes, so gas transmission, rights of way, gas storage, and we prioritized based upon where we thought the largest risks might be. And we're comfortable that we think we've identified all of the large risks. We're not through all of the asset classes yet, but the ones that we're working through and we want to be through our top to bottom review certainly by the end of 2013. But since they're lower-risk areas, we don't expect numbers to emerge that would be anywhere near what we're seeing from the right-of-way clearance numbers.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Right. And if you've already said this, I apologize. But can you remind me what FERC ROE is assumed in the earnings guidance for '13?","Kent M. Harvey","Yes, Hugh, we're assuming the 9.1%, which was what we were ordered to refile with the FERC. So that is assumed for 2013.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Brian Chin with Citi.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Asked and answered, actually.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Ashar Khan [ph] with Visium.","Unknown Analyst","Kent, can I just ask what -- I might have missed this in your presentations, I apologize. Running -- what is the average shares outstanding in the '13 guidance?","Anthony F. Earley","I actually didn't provide a share count for the '13 guidance, but we have indicated that the year-end count was 431 million shares and that our guidance based on the assumptions we've provided is to issue equity of between $1 billion and $1.2 billion during 2013, and that all is based on our current accrual for the fine so if the fine ends up being an incremental amount above that, then you would want to adjust those estimates accordingly.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. If I can then ask another related question, where did the book value per share end up for the corporation at the end of the year?","Anthony F. Earley","I don't have that with me, Ashar, but that will be available when we get our 10-K out later today.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. Looking at both Page 6 and Page 8, kind of the guidance on the natural gas matters. First question, I completely understand the moving all the PSEP and all the San Bruno items into the IIC. But just curious what went behind the decision to move things like the right-of-way work. I mean, doing work for the next 5 years strikes me as a recurring item a little bit. That's the first question. Second, can you clarify that second bullet point on financing and depreciation cost? Are you saying that's $1 billion and therefore you'd apply kind of whatever depreciation rate to that to get to what the earnings drag from that would be?","Kent M. Harvey","Yes, this is Kent. I'll take your second question first and you're interpreting the bullet on Slide 6 correctly. We expect our CapEx to be roughly $1 billion over what was authorized in our last GRC and other proceeding and so during this year, we'll incur the associated financing and depreciation costs on that. And then that's what we would true up in the 2014 General Rate Case, so that's the correct interpretation. Your other question about the natural gas matters is -- you're correct that the right-of-way work is for a long period of time. What we try to do with all the gas matters is give you the full picture of them because every -- all of this really relates to the recovery following the accident at San Bruno. And so what we're trying to do is give you as much transparency as possible so that you can understand what's in there as compared to just have it all blended into our overall GAAP results.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And when we look at your rate base guidance slide of the kind of through 2016, I think it's Slide 12, does that include or exclude the CWIP balance and can you just give us an update on what that CWIP balance is?","Kent M. Harvey","It does not include the CWIP balance and I've indicated in our guidance that we would expect our below-the-line costs that we normally incur to largely offset our equity AFUDC. So we've not included that on the slide. In terms of what CWIP has usually run for us, I would say over the last few years, it's probably averaged in the $1.5 billion range, something like that. So you could probably use that as a ballpark guesstimate.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And I guess one final question just when you think about financing and over the next 12 to 24 months, really the next several years, would you ever consider using anything other than just straight common, meaning converts or something like that? We've seen some other companies in the industry use that to help finance when they've got a multiyear kind of high growth in CapEx planned? Or does -- from a regulatory standpoint, does that make it harder to use instruments like that?","Anthony F. Earley","No, I would say those are instruments that we are definitely considering in the future. We have a lot of different alternatives, and we're really trying to figure out which ones make the most sense for us given our profile, sort of the timing and nature of our needs. But those are definitely on the radar screen.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I just want to know when I look at your -- the midpoint of your 2013 guidance, I look at your forecasted rate base, I calculate an earned ROE of somewhere like 5.0%, 5.1%. Can you break out what you think the earned ROEs will be in '13 for your electric and gas business? And going forward in '14 and '15, any comments on where you expect those ROEs to be?","Kent M. Harvey","This is Kent. I don't intend to break out earned ROEs that specifically, but I would point you again to Slide 6, which essentially shows you what our authorized returns are. And then in the lower right-hand corner, we have what we label as EPS factors. Those are the key items that will affect our ability to earn the authorized return. So we've been telling you for a while about our incremental spend across the utility and that includes both the gas and the electric parts of our business of $250 million. We just spoke briefly about the impact of higher CapEx for 2013. We talked about the fact that we're expecting our below-the-line costs to essentially offset our CWIP earnings this year. And then we have continued to have a little bit lower gas storage revenues that was -- than was assumed in our gas pipeline case and that's kind of comparable to last year, but it has been a bit of a drag compared to an authorized return. And then the offset to that is that we do assume that we get energy efficiency incentive as we got late last year.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. If I look then I guess past '14, and I just want to make sure I've heard the correct statements, I think Tony had said earlier in the call that in '14 you expect to earn your allowed return in electric. Is that correct? And possibly in '15, when you file your gas case, is it reasonable to assume that you earn your allowed return or I guess the only cost that you're not putting in there would be the right-of-way encroachment. Is that accurate?","Anthony F. Earley","Yes, I think that's right. When you say gas, in that case, what we're talking about is the gas pipeline part of our company. Gas distribution will be addressed in our General Rate Case in 2014.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And it's reasonable to say that '14, you guys earn the allowed return in, I guess, gas distribution and electric, and '15, you hope to have all the gas pipeline costs except right of way in that rate case for new rates, January 1 of '15?","Anthony F. Earley","That's what our objective is.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jon Cohen with ISI Group.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I just had a question about the timing of the equity issuance. So if we're standing at the end of 2013 and you would have issued the $1 billion to $1.2 billion, can we assume that all of the unrecovered costs through '13 are now going to be incorporated in your capital structure and you're going to be sitting at a 52% equity ratio and really beyond 2013, the only equity that you'll have to issue other than normal course of business CapEx and the fine is going to be for the integrity management, the PSEP, O&M in '14 and the integrity and -- sorry, and the encroachment beyond 2013?","Kent M. Harvey","This is Kent. I think you're thinking about it the right way. We don't really necessarily manage to be at exactly our authorized equity ratio of, say, December 31, 2013, but we do have to manage our capital structure over a period of time such that it averages to that level. So sometimes, we're slightly below. Sometimes, we're slightly above. But the intent of your statement is correct, which is that we try to keep up with our equity needs over time. And I think the way you articulated some of the cost beyond 2013 that we would need to fund with incremental equity sounds appropriate to me.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then can you just let us know in that $1 billion to $1.2 billion, do you assume any incremental insurance recoveries above what's already been received?","Kent M. Harvey","We've not provided in our guidance any assumptions about insurance. When we do our internal forecasting and determine some of the ranges of our -- what financing needs we have, we usually try to come up with some assumptions about insurance proceeds, but we're not disclosing what those are baked in to our equity assumptions.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the last question is do you have some flexibility over when you issue the equity? So if you think that you might get closer to a settlement between now and year end, could you put off the equity issuance and sort of lean on short-term debt or the parent revolver and do one big equity issuance later in the year?","Kent M. Harvey","Yes, we do have flexibility about the timing. Although we do need to maintain our capital structure over time. So we wouldn't want to get too far off on that issue, but we do have some flexibility there and we do intend to issue it in a way that's efficient and to not be -- to have to be rushed to issue equity in a way that wouldn't make sense for our company and our shareholders. So we would try to manage that and I would anticipate if we needed to manage the timing of an issuance that we could do some short-term measures to give us that flexibility such as you describe.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I wonder if you could quantify the difference in the drop from 2012 EPS to 2013 midpoint guidance that came from that cut in the allowed ROE and then also perhaps the cash flow impact from that.","Anthony F. Earley","Well, that is the biggest item, Travis. There's no doubt about it. I think you can pretty much just get there by taking the rate base amounts, which we have broken up by line of business so you can take electric transmission, for example, and you could go from what was sort of implicitly in our guidance before for last year of 11.35% and take it down to 9.1% from 52% of that rate base. And then you could do the same calculation for the other lines of business going from 11.35% to our new assumption of 10.4% based on the PUC's decision. And I think you'll pretty much land with what we landed with.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then, real quick, how much incremental debt do you expect to issue in 2013, I would say, for the equity above that?","Anthony F. Earley","We've been -- if you look over the last several years, we've been issuing long-term debt annually that probably averages about $1 billion and I wouldn't expect a significant difference in that in terms of an order of magnitude change or anything. So somewhere in that very rough range would probably be a reasonable expectation for 2013.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fallon with SIR Capital Management.","Kevin Fallon","Just a question, do your financing plans and your rate base guidance include the impact of bonus depreciation?","Kent M. Harvey","They do for this most recent bonus depreciation, but the reality of our situation is given the pancaking we've had from last several years of bonus depreciation, even before 2013 bonus was approved, we already were expecting to be in a net operating loss position for 2013. So it's really not going to be providing us any financing benefit incrementally in 2013. And we'll probably see that benefit actually next year just given our current situation.","Kevin Fallon","Okay. And just to clarify, on Slide 12, the rate base slide, those are average rate bases or year-end rate bases for the shown years?","Kent M. Harvey","Those are average rate bases.","Kevin Fallon","Okay. And finally, just if you could give some color on the FERC rate case process? As you go through the settlement talks, when you ultimately come to the endpoint, however it turns out, is the ROE adjusted for the change in the 10-year treasury? So if interest rates move higher, do they make adjustment or are you stuck at that base 8.6% for this proceeding no matter what?","Thomas E. Bottorff","This is Tom Bottorff, Senior Vice President of Regulatory Affairs. The rate of return has yet to be determined that we're seeking but if we settle the case, the rate of return is sort of [indiscernible], it's not explicitly adopted as part of the settlement. So as in prior rate cases, there really is no adopted rate of return. That would only happen in the event of going to litigation [indiscernible].","Kevin Fallon","But that's what I mean. They gave you a point estimate to change rates on under the current to the 8.6% base ROE and that's what I'm asking. That was an administrative determination by the FERC and is there an administrative process x something in your settlement that changes that or is that 8.6% the base unless you reach a different number in the settlement?","Thomas E. Bottorff","If we reach a different number in the settlement, then the rate would we based on that adopted figure.","Kevin Fallon","But if the case is litigated and rates move higher, is it adjusted upward or is it stuck at that 8.6%?","Kent M. Harvey","Right now, the issue is we had to submit our application with the 9.1%. It has the 8.6% plus the 50 basis point adder for the California ISO and that is based on data that was available when we did the filing. And essentially, we looked at a number of comparable utilities and it is prescriptive in that we're required to use the DCF model, which, of course, is particularly disadvantageous in this current economic environment and we don't think representative of our true cost of equity. So we would have to litigate that and unless the FERC ended up with something that was more reasonable, then we would have to seek legal review of that decision.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from the line of Ashar Khan [ph].","Unknown Analyst","Kent, I just went back and looked at your 10-K from the third quarter, so I guess you were around $30 and then I've got the GAAP earnings and the dividend. Am I -- tell me if I'm doing my utility maths wrong or right. GAAP earnings, you're showing this year, $1.66 to $2. The dividend is around that level. So assuming we come out book value does not increase, it remains at 30 or so, then is it fair to look at it that if the company earns around 10% that by the end of '13 that the earning power is more like $3 a share or something like that?","Kent M. Harvey","I don't know. I can't follow your logic over the phone. So if you want to follow up with our IR team about your question, maybe we can handle it that way, Ashar.","Gabriel B. Togneri","I apologize for breaking in and if there are any questions remaining, but we do have some constraints on this end.

As you know, we took quick and decisive action, making it clear to our employees and the public that non-compliance has no place in our organization. And with the help of outside side experts, we\u2019re establishing a best in class compliance program. I also want to acknowledge that we still don\u2019t have a final resolution in the gas transmission OII investigations. With the proposed decision issued last September, we believe the commission has all the information it needs and we hope to see a final decision soon.","Now, as we look ahead with the resolution of the General Rate Case last year, we\u2019re positioned to continue investing in our gas and electric systems. We plan to build on our progress for the past few years by continuing to upgrade our gas and electric infrastructure and leverage technology to enhance performance and modernize the grid.","Over the next few years, we expect our capital spending to be more than $5 billion a year and we\u2019re optimistic about PG&E\u2019s growth opportunities. We plan to continue to take advantage of our location near Silicon Valley to help design and build the grid of the future, or as we\u2019ve been calling it, the grid of things, where distributor generation, electric vehicles, energy storage, and other technologies are integrated into a two-way power grid.","Governor Brown recently set out some ambitious goals for California to significantly reduce carbon emissions by 20130. We believe these policies are in line with our own strategies on clean energy, vehicle electrification and energy efficiency and look forward to working with policymakers to develop and implement these new standards. In fact, yesterday, we filed an application at the CPUC to invest $500 million over five years in electric vehicle charging infrastructure, which we believe is critical for EV adoption and greenhouse-gas reduction. We\u2019re glad the CPUC has recognized that the utilities are important players in the electrification of the transportation sector and we\u2019re eager to get our program approved and under way.","So with that, now, let me turn it over to Chris.","Chris Johns","Thanks Tony and good morning everyone. As you can see on Slide 4, I\u2019ll begin my remarks with an update on our operations and then touch on some additional regulatory developments from the quarter and the year. As Tony mentioned, we had a really strong operational results in 2014. Starting with safety, we\u2019re extremely proud of our performance on key public safety metrics such as gas odor response time, 911 response and third party dig-ins. For example, last year PG&E employees responded to gas emergency calls in an average of less than 20 minutes, which represents one of the fastest response times in the industry.","In terms of electric reliability, 2014 was our sixth straight year of record performance for outage duration and our customers experienced the fewest outages in company history. We also opened our first of three state-of-the-art electric distribution controls centers last year, integrating leading technology to further improve operations. In terms of electric supply, we continue to make good progress on our goal of 33% qualified renewables by 2020. In last year, our electric supply portfolio was more than 50% greenhouse-gas-free making us one of the cleanest utilities in the country.","On the gas side, we\u2019re especially proud of the international certifications we received for our asset management practices. Not only did we receive the initial certifications from Lloyd\u2019s Register in May, but in November, we were recertified after an extensive follow-up audit, which validated the sustainability of our program. We\u2019re one of only a few utilities in the world to achieve these certifications.","Also in gas last month we announced that we now completed our system-wide cast iron pipe replacement program, making our gas system even safer. And you can see on the slide the extensive work we completed on strength testing, valve automation, and pipe replacement. Now, all of this work is being acknowledged by our customers. Our customer satisfaction results in 2014 were the highest we\u2019ve seen since 2009, which is before the San Bruno accident. While we\u2019re proud of all of these achievements, we know we have more work to do, and we\u2019ll continue to look for, find, and fix areas that need improvement.","Moving on to our pipeline safety enhancement plan, or our PSEP, we\u2019ve completed the majority of the planned expense work in PSEP, although a small amount of work will continue into this year, and Kent will cover how this fits into our 2015 plans. On the capital side of the program, the last part of the PSEP has proven to be very challenging. Late last year, we determined that the permitting and routing for a number of the remaining pipeline replacement projects, including some in environmentally sensitive areas, will be more difficult than we previously expected. So we now expect the work to be more costly and will be completed over the next few years, which is longer than we had originally anticipated. Since the PSEP program has a cap on the recovery of capital, we took a charge of $116 million in the fourth quarter for these higher expected costs.","Shifting to regulatory matters, the hearings in the gas transmission and storage rate case started last week and are expected to conclude this month. The current schedule calls for a final decision in August, with revenues retroactive to January 1st of this year. As a reminder, the final decision on the order to show causes related to ex parte communications in the gas transmission rate case called for a disallowance of up to five months of the increase in the authorized revenue. As you know, we have appealed that portion of the decision.","In other regulatory matters, in December, the commission approved an incentive award for our energy efficiency programs and our cost of capital mechanism was extended for another year. It will now be in place through the end of 2016.","So with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Ken.","Kent Harvey","Thank you and good morning. As usual, I plan to go through our Q4 results and I\u2019ll provide some insights about our 2015 outlook. Slide 5 shows our results for Q4 and full year 2014. Earnings from operations came in at $0.53 for the quarter and $3.50 for the year. GAAP earnings, including our items impacting comparability are shown here as well. We\u2019ve got the details regarding the natural gas item in the table at the bottom in pre-tax dollars.","Our pipeline-related expenses came in at $102 million for the quarter and $347 million for the year, which was just below our guidance range. As Chris mentioned, a modest amount of PSEP related expense work will spill over into 2015. Next is the disallowed capital write-off for PSEP of $116 million related to the higher costs to complete the remaining PSEP capital work. Because there is a cost cap in place, we wrote off those costs that we anticipate will come in above the cap.","On the next slide, you see that we recorded $12 million of fines, mainly for the gas distribution accident in Carmel last March. We believe that fine is excessive and we\u2019ve requested a rehearing. We adjusted our third-party liability claims related to San Bruno down by $7 million as a result of settling the last few claims in Q4. That leaves our total loss at $558 million versus our previous estimate of $565 million. Finally, we booked $26 million in insurance recoveries in the quarter for a total of $112 million for the year.","Slide 6 is the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations and you\u2019ve seen many of these same drivers in previous quarters. The first three items relate primarily to 2014 \u2013 to the 2014 General Rate Case and they totaled $0.19. I\u2019m just going to go through each of them briefly. First, as a result of the GRC decision, our expense recovery increased $0.08 quarter-over-quarter. This represents the impact of recovering higher levels of spend that were not being recovered in 2013.","Second, we had a positive $0.06 resulting from tax benefits related to our federal tax deduction for repairs costs. Third, we recorded earnings on a higher authorized rate base. This totaled $0.05. As you see, we also had some smaller positive items in the quarter, a pick up on some regulatory matters, the absence of some project and lease charges experienced in the prior year and various other items included in miscellaneous.","These positives were partially offset by a $0.14 timing item related to taxes and operating expenses that was driven mainly by the delay in our General Rate Case. You may remember this from last quarter\u2019s call. In Q4, this item turned around, as expected, reversing out the impact experienced earlier in the year. Finally, our share dilution came in at $0.02 negative quarter-over-quarter.","Now, I\u2019d like to provide a few thoughts about our future performance. Since we\u2019re still awaiting resolution of the gas pipeline investigations by the CPUC, we\u2019re not providing guidance today for 2015 earnings. However, we are providing key assumptions for earnings from operations and items impacting comparability to help you understand our profile.","If you turn to Slide 7, you\u2019ll see some key assumptions for 2015 earnings from operations. First in the upper left, you see we\u2019re assuming capital expenditures of roughly $5.5 billion this year. The breakdown by line of business is included here as well. In the upper right, you see that our estimate of weighted average authorized rate base is about $31 billion. Both the CapEx and rate base assumptions are consistent with ranges, we\u2019ve previously provided, so no real change there. In the lower left, you\u2019ll see that there also are no changes to our assumptions regarding authorized return on equity and equity ratio. At the bottom right of the slide, we list some other factors we believe will affect 2015 earnings from operations.","Our objective for EFO is to earn our authorized return on rate base for the enterprise as a whole plus the net impact of the factors listed here. Many of these should look familiar from last year and I\u2019ll briefly touch on them and reiterate what we\u2019ve previously told you about them. In terms of the gas transmission and storage rate case, the first bullet is just a reminder that the outcome of the case is not known at this stage, so we have some uncertainty regarding the impact on 2015 results.","The second bullet under the gas transmission case is also a reminder that we\u2019ve not sought recovery of some operating expenses in 2015 and beyond. These are for certain corrosion and strength testing work. We previously indicated that these expenses taken together should average roughly $50 million annually over the three year period although the amount may vary year-to-year. Next is the tax benefits associated with the repairs deduction. Last year, the net impact from this item was almost a quarter and we\u2019ve indicated that we expect it to be a similar order of magnitude in 2015.","The next two factors: incentive revenues and monetizing SolarCity shares, you saw last year as well. In terms of SolarCity, we said that about two thirds of the shares were monetized in 2014. As a result, you should expect a smaller impact this year than last. Finally, like last year we expect earnings on construction work in progress to be roughly offset by the below-the-line cost, so these include advertising, charitable contributions, environmental costs, and so forth.","Before I move on to the next slide, I want to make one more point. We won\u2019t receive a final decision in the gas transmission rate case until at least the third quarter, based on the current schedule. Because the decision will be retroactive to January 1, the timing should not affect our annual earnings from operations, but it will have an impact on our quarterly results, just as you saw with our General Rate Case last year.","Okay, turning to Slide 8, you\u2019ll see our assumptions for items impacting comparability in 2015. Our framework for 2015 will have three components, pipeline related expenses, legal and regulatory related expenses and fines and penalties. I\u2019ll walk you through each of these. First, we\u2019re providing an estimated range for pipeline related expenses of $100 million to $150 million, which represents a significant reduction from prior years. The majority of the dollars here are for clearing our pipeline rights away. We\u2019re now beginning the third year of that program, which we have estimated to cost up to $500 million from its inception in 2013 through its plan completion in 2017.","The range for pipeline related expenses also includes a smaller amount, roughly $25 million, for the PSEP expense work that was carried over from last year. Second is legal and regulatory related expenses, which we estimate it to be between $25 million and $75 million for the year. Here, we\u2019ve consolidated all legal and other cost expected to be incurred in connection with litigation and enforcement activities related to either natural gas matters or regulatory communications.","Third, our potential fines and penalties, again, related to either natural gas matters or regulatory communications. For example, this would include resolution of the gas pipeline investigations by the CPUC. It would also include gas transmission rate case revenues disallowed by the CPUC as a penalty for ex parte communications. As has been our practice in the past, we\u2019re not providing guidance for fines and penalties in 2015.","Moving onto Slide 9, we assume equity issuance of $400 million to $600 million in 2015 that compares to equity issuance last year of $827 million. This range is consistent with the other assumptions I provided this morning, including our CapEx profile, and our items impacting comparability and assumes we receive a reasonable outcome in our gas transmission rate case. Importantly, the range does not reflect additional fines or penalties in connection with natural gas matters or regulatory communications, those would be incremental to this range.","Finally Slide 10 and Slide 11 summarize our assumptions for CapEx and rate base through 2016 and these are consistent with what we\u2019ve shown you previously. A total CapEx is expected to remain well above $5 billion annually during this period, our average rate base is expected to grow to more than $33 billion in 2016, representing about a 9% CAGR over 2014. ","We anticipate providing you with CapEx and rate base numbers beyond 2016, once we filed our 2017 general rate case this fall.","I\u2019ll end with that and we\u2019ll open up the lines for your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instruction] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Julien Smith with UBS. You may proceed.","Julien Smith","Hi good morning. ","Dinyar Mistry","Good morning ","Julien Smith","Hi, so congrats again on a good and decent quarter here. And just wanted to kind of kick it off with the question on bonus D&A here. If you don\u2019t mind rehashing. It didn\u2019t look like the rate base has shifted all that much versus what you last projected here. How does that flow through, if you can kind of realigned [ph] it? ","Dinyar Mistry","This is Dinyar Mistry, the controller. So as you know, bonus was past all the way at the end of 2014 and in our general rate case we have a mechanism that similar to what we had in the past it\u2019s called Tama. And it basically provides for us to use that bonus benefit for additional CapEx. Since we got bonus all the way at the end of the year, it really didn\u2019t have very much impact and we factored that into the rate base numbers that you see here. ","Julien Smith","Got you. So no real negative impact here for 2015 earnings as far as it goes.","Dinyar Mistry","No it should not be, and additionally we\u2019re in an annualized situation. So that dampens the impact.","Julien Smith","Great and then secondly, for bigger picture here. As you look at the renewable portfolio standard and the potential shift to 50%. What is that mean near-term in terms of spend just broadly speaking the renewables and secondly, your specific spend whether would be directly in renewable technologies broadly or frankly from a T&B perspective what does this mean, in terms of accelerated deployment. ","Tony Earley","Well, this is Tony. I\u2019ll start off. First of all there is a long way to go between where we\u2019re today and a specific plan for California, the governor person stated the state speech outlined some long-term objectives, the utilities here in California are all working together and want to work with the state to develop. What those policies are, clearly will be going above 33% we think that a clean energy standard that gives us some flexibility going forward make sense, but in any event even assuming we\u2019re going to be continuing to develop our renewable portfolio. Most of the renewables now are part of our purchase power portfolio.","We did do some utility owned seller early on decided that wasn\u2019t strength for us. So I would anticipate that in the future as our renewables go up that just we\u2019ll slow through our purchase power accounts rather than being investment in capital. Although, we continue to look at new technologies, but it will do as this renewables go up, the grid becomes more complex to manage and as Chris said in number of speeches that\u2019s our investment opportunity to invest in going from the traditional one way flow of power on the grid to multi flow power that is not as predictable. And that\u2019s going to be where we think their growth opportunities.","Julien Smith","Great. Could you elaborate just a little bit about the growth opportunity has been, what\u2019s the timeline here which you think the 50% moves happen if you will? What could we see the dollars flowing and how do we get from A to Z here, if you will?","Chris Johns","Yes. This is Chris. First of all, we don\u2019t know again as Tony said on the timing of what the 50% would look like and again we would most likely wouldn\u2019t be making investments in any of the facilities themselves. But as far as the future of the grid we\u2019ve actually already started that we\u2019ve been working on it for last several years, you may remember our Cornerstone project that helped us start to make investments in modernizing the grid and we\u2019re going to continue to do that. We don\u2019t have projections out there throughout the dollars look like, but those are dollars that we\u2019ve already started to put in place.","And some of our projections that you already see here around 2015 and 2016 include some dollars for continuing to modernize. So as we\u2019ve continue to move forward with making sure that we\u2019re in a position to be able to hook up the solar panels in the batteries in the plug-in vehicles into our system, we\u2019ve continued to evaluate, not just replacing old wire, but modernizing the entirety of the system in putting more technology into it. And that\u2019s what you\u2019ll continue to see from us and we\u2019ll just continue to build them into our rate base growth.","Julien Smith","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. You may proceed.","Greg Gordon","Thanks, good morning.","Chris Johns","Good morning, Greg.","Kent Harvey","Hi, Greg.","Greg Gordon","The tax benefits, should we assume that they will repeat, but at a lower level n 2016 and then sort of work \u2013 and then be gone post 2016 or - I remember [indiscernible] you\u2019ve given any guidance with regard to the trajectory post 2015?","Kent Harvey","Greg, this is Kent. We\u2019ve really just indicated that the tax benefits were really in connection with our General Rate Case, which is a three-year proceeding. So yes, you should expect them through 2016.","Greg Gordon","Okay. And then you have a rate case in 2016 and the rates in 2017 and so that would get\u2026","Kent Harvey","That would be reflected in that proceeding, that\u2019s correct.","Greg Gordon","Okay, energy efficiency revenues, you booked \u2013 so I think you booked $0.04 in fiscal year 2014. Based on the new scheme, should we expect that you have an opportunity annually to continue to book earnings in that order of magnitude? And how should we think about that?","Kent Harvey","Well, last year we did book in December the award was for a year and a half. So it\u2019s a little unusual. It wasn\u2019t just a single year. And again, it\u2019s with significant lags, these awards. So the awards we just got were for 2012 I think and half of 2013. So I think what we\u2019ll be booking this year will probably be for subsequent to that. The new scheme will be in place after that.","Greg Gordon","Okay. And then finally on page eight of your handout, you pointed out, there\u2019s a place holder for fines and penalties. Just to make sure I have this right that\u2019s for potential fines and penalties in the San Bruno cases. You also potentially be disallowed some revenue requirement in the GT&S case? And then should we also sort of notionally have a place holder there for the potential for financial impacts from criminal indictment? Is there anything else out there that I\u2019m missing that would sort of go into that catch-all?","Kent Harvey","Well, right now it\u2019s hard to know what is going to happen with all the ex parte stuff because there is a lot of stuff that we have filed at the commission. And we\u2019re not really clear what will come out of that. In addition, we do know that there are investigations related to the regulatory communications by the State Attorney General as well as Federal prosecutors and that\u2019s also unclear.","Greg Gordon","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. You may proceed. ","Dan Eggers","Hi, good morning, guys. Just maybe as a follow-on to Julien\u2019s questions, can you give us a little more explanation of all the things that are going into the grid of things project that\u2019s going on, how much CapEx is going into that right now and kind of the scalability of that. How long you think it would be before that was more broadly deployed on the system?","Tony Earley","Yes, Dan, we haven\u2019t broken out the specific capital investments associated with the grid, but you see our capital budgets next year, about 5.5 billion I think is our spend. We haven\u2019t given guidance for future years, but we have said that you can expect comparable levels of capital investment. Now, within that, a big - there is a big chunk for upgrading the grid. So you go back a couple years and you start with going to virtually 100% smart meters. We\u2019ve talked about then automating switches on the system. So that we can automatically shift when we have outages and that has paid tremendous benefits.","The Napa earthquake and the storms that we had at the end of 2014, in fact just last week we had some major storms here in California and had really superb results because we\u2019re able to immediately detect where the outages are and then automatically reconfigure the system. So we\u2019re doing that. And then the other future investments will be control systems, A, to monitor the state of the grid as you\u2019ve got all of these renewables dumping into the system at points that we never anticipated when the system was built. So to be able to detect and then to be able to control voltages on those systems. And that\u2019s an ongoing program. Chris, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment on the specifics. But I think that\u2019s going to be something that\u2019s going to be in every capital budget going forward.","Chris Johns","Yes, I agree. And again, we haven\u2019t put out what those dollars look like on a forecast basis, but they are included to the extent we\u2019re working on them in 2015 and 2016 and the numbers you see in front of you\u2026","Tony Earley","I mean one other point I\u2019ll make is our filing this week proposing about a $100 million a year investment in charging is also part of that. I mean, our view is that as we go forward, as we renovate different circuits, we ought to be installing EV charging at appropriate places within that renovated circuit, because that\u2019s what the grid ought to look like going forward. ","Dan Eggers","Tony, just on the charging release, how was the approval process going to work from that and the other is what people who are trying to do it on a merchant basis who know that will challenge you? How do you guys kind of defend this as utility and investment opportunity?","Tony Earley","Let me start off with the issue around challenging as a merchant activity. I mean, California for a number of years did not allow utilities to participate in the public charging market. We could build charging stations for our own fleet, but not for the public. On the theory that entrepreneurs would jump in and provide this service, I can tell you not only from our experience here in California, my experience at DT where we had unregulated subsidiaries that at times would look at this. The entrepreneurial model just isn\u2019t going to work. There isn\u2019t enough margin in that business, where at my work is for some of those entrepreneurs that actually produce the charging stations to partner with us and we\u2019ll install the infrastructure. Let me ask Steve Malnight is here with me to talk about what the regulatory process looks like for going forward.","Steve Malnight","Hi, this is Steven Malnight from the Regulatory Affairs team. So, we filed our application and we will be looking for the commission to issue schedule for that proceeding. As you know, Southern California Edison and San Diego also have proceedings that are going on at the same time. So we\u2019ll wait to see what that schedule will look like, as it comes out.","Chris Johns","And the only other thing, Dan, that I would add to that, this is Chris, is that our filing, we are only looking at about 25% of the marketplace. So, there is still huge amount of room for competitors, if they want to try to continue to operate in that market, there\u2019s plenty of opportunity for them.","Dan Eggers","Got it. And I guess one last question just on, I guess your challenger your appeal to the delayed revenue recovery, because they are ex parte communications on GT&S. Can you just walk through the process and the schedule for that to get resolved? And this is just something that could be said with some other number, rather than having to go through it fully adjudicated process?","Chris Johns","Let me let\u2019s say Hyun Park, General Counsel talk about the schedule for that.","Hyun Park","Yes, Dan, we filed an application for rehearing of that decision. That was filed on December 26 and all the briefings have been submitted by all the parties, so it remains to be seen when the commission will act on that rehearing and, as you know, the GT&S case is currently going through hearings right now.","Dan Eggers","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. You may proceed.","Anthony Crowdell","Hi, good morning, I guess I want to ask the same question. What is 2017 CapEx looks like so? Is moving toward a different, you\u2019ve seen like you punch it on the first two. I guess just a two quick questions. One is you\u2019ve given us equity guidance in 2015, I mean, any thoughts to doing converts or something else, something other than equity going forward with this large CapEx forecast? And the second the GT&S rate case is delayed, but I think there\u2019s a GT&S 2 that\u2019s down the pipe. When does that get filed?","Kent Harvey","Anthony this is Kent. Let me take the first one. In terms of our equity needs, you can see they are more modest this year for our normal CapEx program. The uncertainty that we really have, obviously from a financing perspective, are when are the gas matters really resolved with the OII. And that\u2019s really what\u2019s going to drive our financing needs. And as I\u2019ve said in the past, depending upon the nature of that, the timing of it, the magnitude and the various components, that there are alternatives such as, such as mandatory converts that we would consider. It all just depends on the details of the final decision. The second part of your question.","Chris Johns","This is Chris. Your second one, I\u2019m not sure there is a specific GT&S Phase 2 that you\u2019re thinking of but the next rate case with GT&S would be filed in 2017 or 2018 because it\u2019s a three year cycle.","Anthony Crowdell","Okay. So I guess just in \u2013 in your electric case ends in 2016, new electric rates I guess in 2017 and then new gas rates would be in 2018 is that correct?","Chris Johns","Before the pipeline that is correct.","Anthony Crowdell","Before the pipeline, great, thank you. And do you sure, you don\u2019t want to give us the 2017 CapEx or?","Chris Johns","Let us make it better.","Anthony Crowdell","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.","Michael Lapides","Yes. A couple of questions, first of all, I know somebody ask about bonus D&A in terms of what it means for rate base. But can you talk about what it means for cash flow in 2015?","Dinyar Mistry","Hi, Michael, this is Dinyar, again. So as I mentioned, we\u2019re in an annual situation so it really doesn\u2019t mean much for cash flow.","Michael Lapides","Okay. Can you talk about expectations kind of the spread do you expect which mean kind of gap in cash taxes meaning the fact you\u2019ve got such as sizable NOL does that imply that you\u2019re not really - you\u2019re not much of a federal cash taxpayer this year and how far out in the future do you expect that to extend?","Dinyar Mistry","Yes, that\u2019s correct. We don\u2019t anticipate being a federal cash taxpayer in 2015 or 2016. So I think it will extend out into 2017.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you, guys, and one thing on CapEx.","Dinyar Mistry","Michael, I just wanted to add that \u2013 that\u2019s already embedded in the equity assumptions that we\u2019ve given out.","Michael Lapides","Right. Okay. So it already impacts the financing. When we look out at CapEx can you talk about the variability as part of the GT&S case meaning how much \u2013 how much from the GT&S case outcomes win your expected CapEx in either 2015 or 2016?","Dinyar Mistry","Well, you can actually see on the Slide 7, that we show for gas transmission a couple of $100 million of potential variability.","Michael Lapides","Okay. So that\u2019s both 2015 and for 2016?","Chris Johns","Well, we\u2019re showing that as the, as for 2015 because that\u2019s the year that we\u2019re providing line of business guidance like that. But you could expect probably a similar type of impact in two years, depending upon how the rate comes out.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thanks guys much appreciated.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock. You may proceed.","Paul Patterson","Good morning, can you hear me? Okay.","Chris Johns","We can hear Paul.","Paul Patterson","With respect to San Bruno, I know you guys were thinking that was going to be done by the end of the year. I\u2019m just wondering what do you think if cause the delay and how should we think about the conclusion of this process going forward?","Chris Johns","Well, I think it\u2019s fairly, obviously the delay was caused by the issues around the ex parte communications. And then with the departure of President Peevey, getting a new President, appointed and then a new commissioner in. But we now have all of those pieces in place, with President Picker there and a new commissioner so. Everything is now in the hands of the commission, they\u2019ve got the recommended decision and so I think it\u2019s now in their hands to go ahead and make a decision, we don\u2019t think there is anything more the parties need to do in the case.","Paul Patterson","Okay, but you haven\u2019t had any word or anything about how of any sort of template and data or anything like that is to \u2013 we should be thinking about?","Chris Johns","No, we haven\u2019t.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then just in terms of the ex partes I realized that there is several proceedings going on and we don\u2019t know how those are going to necessarily go or how long they are going to take, but is pretty much most of the ex parte communications to that to your knowledge, now out there? I mean, is that should we I mean in terms of discovery and stuff, are we sort of finished with that, do you think?","Chris Johns","As I said in the past we have done a comprehensive search of all of the places where we believe there is some \u2013 there is a possibility that there would be ex parte communications","And I have disclosed to everyone that \u2013 every instance that we are aware of. That said, there are multiple proceedings going on. There are lots of requests for more access to company records and e-mails. When you put it in perspective, we got 22,000 employees if they produce 10 e-mails a day, that\u2019s a million e-mails every five days.","Paul Patterson","Yes.","Tony Earley","I get asked all the time, have you looked at every e-mails, my answer is no. Have we looked where we think it\u2019s likely to have an ex parte communication absolutely.","Paul Patterson","Fair enough. Okay and then just on the criminal case. Do we have a schedule now at this point or we still sort of where are we in the process?","Hyun Park","So this is Hyun Park. So we have a hearing that\u2019s scheduled for March 9 and I think the expectation is that\u2019s when the motion schedule will be set.","Paul Patterson","Okay, then back to sort of Dan\u2019s question on the electric vehicles, it looked to me, I mean from what I read, $654million and looked that there was going to be a charge for customers between 2018 and 2022. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m piecing together. I haven\u2019t actually been able to look at the full filing. Is there some sort of amortization that\u2019s unique to this CapEx that would suggest that the recovery would be over that period of time or just to sort of get a flavor for what exactly is going into this. I mean, it looks like it would be $26,000 per station. Is that a fair number? Or is that just also all the other stuff that\u2019s sort of supporting this kind of effort? Do you follow me?","SteveMalnight","Yes this is Steve Malnight yes, the filing we\u2019re anticipating putting that capital into rate base. Normally as we do with our, the rest of our capital and the total cost that we talked about is for all the cost associated with implementing that program.","Paul Patterson","Okay and then the amortization period or the collection period for customers that was mentioned between 2018, 2022 sounds kind of slow, sounds kind of shortened. Is there something about these facilities that would suggest that their recovery should be over a short period of time or is that just how the release came out? Do you follow me?","Kent Harvey","The period of time that looking at wasn\u2019t meant to be what the recovery period time it\u2019s just the expenditures in our implementation of them.","Paul Patterson","Okay. ","Kent Harvey","So this is correct, so the recovery would just a normal recovery period of time. And I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s about, I think $80 million annual revenue requirement stretching out beyond that five-year, or that six-year period of time.","Paul Patterson","And you mentioned the margins were low just a quick clarify this, how much if we would talk about the revenue requirement associated with these stations is being covered by customers versus what quote, unquote the marketplace would be theoretically covering? Do you have a rough breakdown of that?","Chris Johns","Probably not to the level of detail that you\u2019re asking for. But we\u2019re asking for the what would be included in the cover for the customer\u2019s choice is the capital cost that is putting the infrastructure in place. Then the meters would go on and the charges off of those meters would cover the cost of electricity and everything else%.","Tony Earley","And we\u2019re actually looking at having a third party manage that the process. So we are not in that payment processing business. Users would use their credit card and there is a third party would manage that process. ","Paul Patterson","Okay, thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein. You may proceed.","Hugh Wynne","Hi, good morning and congratulations on some of these achievements on the operational side. I just wanted to address initially that I continue to be concerned about on the regulatory side which is the OII into the accuracy of record keeping on the gas distribution side of the business as opposed to gas transmission. And I guess I\u2019m still worried that if the commission really wanted to get grotty about this they could probably find enough inaccuracies in the records to come up with a substantial fund. Can you give us any parameters for how that investigation is going, what likely outcome you see, what financial impact there might be?","Chris Johns","Huge this is Chris. I wish I had more details for you, but we don\u2019t because we don\u2019t have an information yet on the scope of the investigation. So they haven\u2019t - they\u2019ve done, just for reminder for everybody on November 20 of last year, the commission issued an OII in order to show cause, to look into the record keeping around the gas distribution system and they specifically reference six incidents from 2010 to 2014 where they were no fatalities or injuries. But we\u2019ve done a lot of work on a record keeping over the - since San Bruno not just the transmission pipe, but also the distribution pipe. And we continue to do that, but they have not had a scoping meeting or scheduling meeting yet at all and so we filed our responses, but otherwise we don\u2019t have a lot of information as to where they may go on this. We\u2019re waiting for the pre-hearing conference and that has not even been scheduled yet.","Hugh Wynne","Thank you. As I recall there was a program of upgrading the gas distribution system that you conducted several years ago which fell under the items impacted comparability and because those expenditures were not recoverable. Do you foresee the potential for any further unrecoverable capital expenditures on the distribution side of the business such as we\u2019ve seen with the PSEP on the transmission side.","Chris Johns","Yes, I mean obviously again, we don\u2019t know what that record keeping OII would be about, but otherwise we wouldn\u2019t because we just went through our General Rate Case which addresses our gas distribution side of the business. And we got the results of that and we\u2019re going to be operating under that and so we don\u2019t see anything on the horizon that would say we believe we\u2019re at risk of non-recovery of things that we\u2019re doing on our investments in the gas distribution piece of the business.","Hugh Wynne","Great, alright, thank you very much. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar Capital. You may proceed. ","Travis Miller","Good morning, thank you. The TO 16, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the key issues where you are the farthest apart suppose in the settlement conference that\u2019s coming up. And then second, depending on that outcome how would that affects the $1 billion plus that you guys have tagged for CapEx and presumably a similar amount in 2016 and 2017.","Kent Harvey","Travis, this is Kent. Typically we go through a TO case every year. This isn\u2019t going to be any different than the other ones, but we really don\u2019t provide much commentary on it, while it\u2019s underway. ","Travis Miller","Okay. And then would that affect, if you were to get an unfavorable decision, would that affect the transmission spend material those, are those projects that kind of in the process in the ground type of projects.","Kent Harvey","Well, we\u2019ve had a pretty good track record in resolving TO cases and we\u2019re hopeful that\u2019s going to be the outcome this time as well.","Chris Johns","Okay. And this is Chris. Along those lines, as we do with all of our rate cases in regulatory orders, we try to operate within what they rule. So if there was something that wasn\u2019t going to be a project that they didn\u2019t think we need, we would have to reevaluate whether we would do that or not.","Travis Miller","Okay. I think everybody asked my CapEx question is before, so I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed.","Brian Chin","Hi, good morning. ","Tony Earley","Good morning, Brian.","Chris Johns","Good morning, Brian. ","Brian Chin","Just on the slide where you are talking about 2015, what things to think about even though you haven\u2019t given guidance, on the SolarCity, monetizing SolarCity shares, can you just give us a general sense of how big that should be. I realize you\u2019re not in a position to give full guidance, but at least a sense of scale on that part would be helpful.","Kent Harvey","Brian, it\u2019s Kent. Last year, I believe it was in the third and fourth quarter we monetized SolarCity second and third. We monetized shares and I think each of those pickups were about $0.03 for each of those quarters and that basically represents about two-thirds of the total. So I think that gives you a pretty good indication of sort of roughly what we\u2019d expect for this year.","Brian Chin","Great. And lastly, my second question is when it comes to rights of way and surveying costs. It\u2019s been a little while since we\u2019ve heard you guys talk about that in great detail. Should we be at the level now where we feel relatively comfortable that there aren\u2019t going to be unexpected additional costs there? Is there like a percentage of completion that we can think about going forward from here?","Chris Johns","This is Chris. I think as we talked about last year, we did experience some delays in the pathway program because of some vegetation issues in some of the cities, but we still at this point in time are reiterating that we don\u2019t - we believe we\u2019ll be able to finish the program by the end of 2017, which was the original five-year schedule and that we still don\u2019t expected to be in excess of the $500 million that we originally have put out there.","Brian Chin","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.","Steven Fleishman","Hi, good morning.","Chris Johns","Hi, Steve.","Steven Fleishman","Hi, so just on the TO case, the transmission case, you\u2019re assuming kind of returns similar to what you get in the California regulated business.","Kent Harvey","Steve, it\u2019s Kent. We have filed for 1126. Over the last few years, we\u2019ve just been telling people when they think about guidance, particularly given the relative size of electric transmission the rest of our business. We\u2019ve been telling people to do an approximation of comparable authorized return is that the PUC. But the proceeding and the ROE is still under way at the FERC.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. And then just going back to the e-mails and communications side from kind of - I guess do you still owe anything per the process to anybody beyond the 65,000 e-mails you already filed? Is there something that you still have to provide?","Tony Earley","I\u2019ll ask Hyun to answer that. As I said, we get discovery requests in all of our proceedings, but we\u2019re pretty much up to date on all the things we owe.","Chris Johns","So Steve, as Tony said to the request from various parties for discovery and information is ongoing, so I would say we\u2019re current, but I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re completely done with this.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. And then I guess Edison at times talk about kind of other programs that could add to their current rate base plan, things like storage and the like. Do you - and obviously something like this electric vehicle program you announced. Do you have some of those that are out there that would be kind of additive to the plan as it is now? ","Chris Johns","Well, we do anticipate that we\u2019ll be doing storage. We just went out for bids for proposals on storage, but we also have the opportunity to invest in storage. Quite honestly, we\u2019re early on and trying to figure out what technologies make sense and what don\u2019t. We have not factored in any storage investments into our capital plans right now. It\u2019s just too early to do that. The other things around upgrading the grid, they are kind of built into our forecasts of, as we upgrade our system will be upgrading to the newest technologies.","StevenFleishman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.","Michael Lapides","Hey, guys just real quick on the electric transmission, where do you think you are in the cycle in terms of the level of electric transmission capital spending each year, meaning, do you think 2015 is a normal level and kind of a good run rate longer-term, do you think there\u2019s strength that could make that number significantly higher going forward or significantly lower going forward? And if so what would those private drivers be?","Kent Harvey","Michael, its Kent. We really only have guidance out to electric transmission for this year. So I can\u2019t really give you a view beyond 2015 at this point. ","Michael Lapides","Yeah, I\u2019m just, I\u2019m not really looking for a number of more drivers like how do you think about - just kind a where in the cycle and may be not just for you, but kind of for the industry or for the State of California?","Tony Earley","Yes, Michael, what I would say is, of course, the major projects are lumpy, they come and go as the needs go. I think you can assume, if we continue to build the renewals portfolio in California to support that, there\u2019s going to be transmission investments whether we make those investments or not depends on a number of things. There\u2019s a bidding process in California and we did win a bid to jointly develop a new project that\u2019s underway.","In the future, we\u2019ll look at opportunities as they come along. But you can assume we\u2019re going to do them, maybe other parties that will build the transmission to support renewables, then we just purchase the services.","Michael Lapides","Thank you, Tony. Much appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors. You may proceed.","Andy Levi","Hey, good morning.","Tony Earley","Good morning Andy.","Kent Harvey","Good morning.","Andy Levi","I think most of my questions were, after just I have two housekeeping. But I did see that you must have ticked the top on that SolarCity stock when you sold it, so very good on that one. We\u2019ll have to give you a job here, too.","Kent Harvey","Yes.","Andy Levi","Just two housekeeping things, just on the $5.5 billion of CapEx for this year, do we back out any of that that\u2019s not recoverable? Like is part of that like PSEP costs or something like that, so it\u2019s not - doesn\u2019t all go to rate base, I guess is the question.","Dinyar Mistry","Yeah, so this is Dinyar. I think if you look at Slide 7, you\u2019ll see that separately funded piece of a $100 million for PSEP, that spending that we will be doing in 2015 associated with the charge we took in 2014. So that would be the component.","Tony Earley","And that\u2019s the only piece.","Dinyar Mistry","Yes.","Tony Earley","Like, none of this stuff on Page 8, gets backed out, one of those expense items.","Kent Harvey","So the way the accounting works is you take a charge for costs that you anticipate you will not recover on the capital side. So we haven\u2019t yet spent the capital, but we\u2019ve had to take a charge in 2014. That capital will be spent in the future years.","Andy Levi","Alright, but that - for rate base purposes we should be adding $5.4 billion less depreciation in differed taxes to our rate base?","Chris Johns","You could think of it that way, we\u2019ve already given you a rate base guidance.","Andy Levi","No I understand, I understand. Yes, I just like to do it with myself too.","Chris Johns","Sure.","Andy Levi","Okay.","Chris Johns","Sure, yes that [indiscernible] would not be recoverable.","Andy Levi","Okay. And then the second question, just on the insurance recoveries, Kent is there like you\u2019ve collected a 112 in 2014, I don\u2019t know what the total amount is, since the inception of the recoveries. But it\u2019s there - go ahead I\u2019m sorry. ","Dinyar Mistry","Andy the total was $466 million to date.","Andy Levi","Okay $466 million and what\u2019s the maximum you can recover?","Dinyar Mistry","Well we can recover the full liability which we have booked at, $557 million now I think,","Kent Harvey","$558 million.","Dinyar Mistry","Excuse me and then also the litigation cost associated with the third party liability.","Andy Levi","How much could that potentially [indiscernible]?","Dinyar Mistry","That we haven\u2019t separately disclosed. ","Andy Levi","Got it, so it\u2019s up to 558 plus, whatever litigation costs. And there\u2019s no maximum on that litigation cost?","Kent Harvey","That is our estimate of the litigation cost. Oh excuse the litigation cost there is no maximum, it\u2019s whatever was required to pursue the clients.","Operator","I think we have one more question. ","Andy Levi","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium Asset Management. You may proceed.","Ashar Khan","Good morning and great quarter. Kent can you give us an idea like last year in the equity piece, there was a component which came in because of late timing of the GRC. So in this year\u2019s equity $400 million to $600 million, can you give us some rough estimates what could be the impact, I\u2019m assuming there is an impact for delayed GT&S rate case which is coming in later than, should have come in at the beginning of the year. Is there\u2019s somewhere you can guide us on that?","Kent Harvey","Well I\u2019ll say if you actually look at Slide 9, we give some of the drivers to lock you from last year to 2015 and the equity need. And you\u2019re right, the first item is kind of a timing item to when during the year you actually do the financings, but also in the case of last year, the fact that the General Rate Case was delayed until fairly late, means we had a lot of months during the year where we otherwise had to increase our equity component a little bit in order to manage our overall equity ratio.","What you really ask about is, is there a similar phenomenon in 2015 for the gas transmission case? And there is. That\u2019s absolutely true. It\u2019s probably not the same magnitude but there is a similar phenomenon, which otherwise will cause us to have a little more equity this year as compared to the subsequent year when you have the revenues throughout the year. The other drivers up here, just to quickly go over them, we do have because of rate base growth, we do have higher earnings in 2015. So that slightly reduces the equity need this year. We also have lower unrecovered costs we talked about that on the call, similarly reduces the equity need. But we have higher capital expenditures and that\u2019s one factor that goes in the other direction.","Janet Loduca","All right, we would like to thank everybody for participating today and we\u2019ll end the call now.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for attending today\u2019s conference. This will now conclude the call. Please enjoy the rest of your day."],"17400":["PG&E Corp. (NYSE:PCG) Q1 2015 Earnings Call April 29, 2015 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Janet C.

All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call, with an opportunity for questions and answers at the end. I would like to introduce your hostess, Ms. Janet Loduca. You may proceed.","Janet C. Loduca - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Monica. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Before you hear from Tony Earley, Chris Johns and Kent Harvey, I'll remind you that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results based on assumptions, forecasts, expectations and information currently available to management. Some of the important factors that could affect the company's actual financial results are described on the second page of today's slide deck. We also encourage you to review the Form 10-Q that will be filed with the SEC later today and the discussion of risk factors that appears there and in the 2014 Annual Report.","With that, I'll turn it over to Tony.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Janet, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with some opening remarks, and then turn it over to Chris and Kent to provide more detail on both operational and financial issues.","As you know, we received a final penalty decision in the gas transmission pipeline investigations earlier this month, which is a significant milestone. Following the San Bruno accident, we worked hard to do the right thing for the victims, their families and the community of San Bruno. We've dedicated ourselves to becoming the safest and most reliable utility in the country. We've been working to build a culture across the company that supports this mission, and we've completed an unprecedented level of work to improve the safety of our systems, much of it funded by our shareholders.","So although the final penalty assessed by the Commission is the largest in state history and certainly one of the largest in the country, we've decided not to appeal. We just don't feel that prolonging the proceeding is in anyone's interest. As we move forward, I can assure you that the lessons from San Bruno will continue to guide us. The San Bruno accident has changed the way we look at everything, from the way we plan what work we do to the way we execute and document work in the field.","Safety starts at the top. It also requires the unequivocal commitment of every employee. My management team, our employees and the unions who represent them have all made that commitment, and safety has been at the heart of our decisions and actions over the last several years.","I want to acknowledge that we still have a number of proceedings outstanding. On the legal front, a trial date in the federal criminal case has been set for March 8, 2016. As you know, state and federal prosecutors have been investigating potential ex parte communications with the CPUC as well.","There are also still several investigations at the Commission, including a new investigation of our safety culture that President Picker announced at the last Commission meeting. And in fact, we welcome a conversation about safety at PG&E. We're proud of the work we've done to date and we know we still have a lot of work to do to re-earn the trust of our customers and the Commission.","Over the past several years, we've hired some of the best experts in the country to help guide our efforts. Adding to that list, this spring, we announced that we've hired Julie Kane as our new Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, reporting directly to me. Julie has deep compliance experience, largely in the highly regulated pharmaceutical industry, and her mandate is to work with our Board of Directors and our leadership team to build a best-in-class compliance program.","As Chris will discuss, we had another solid quarter in our operations. We're in the third year of a rigorous risk assessment program that we used to develop our five-year operational plan. And I've been really pleased to see that these plans become more robust every year.","And we continue to see strong opportunities for growth as we work to build a better California. In both gas and electric operations, we'll continue to upgrade the system with a focus on reducing risk and enhancing safety and reliability through physical improvements like replacing pipes and wires and using technology to respond to our customers' changing needs.","We're also working on an integrated clean energy plan, which we believe will offer strong support for Governor Brown's vision for reducing carbon emissions. In the coming years, we expect to see continued investment opportunities to support the interactive Grid of Things. This will facilitate the state's increasing reliance on intermittent renewables, electric vehicles, demand-side management tools and energy storage. We have a number of proceedings pending at the Commission to address these changes to the electric grid, and you can expect to see more about this in the future.","So with that, let me turn it over to Chris.","Christopher P. Johns - President, Pacific Gas & Electric Co.","Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my remarks with an update on our operations, and then touch on some additional regulatory developments. I'm going to start with safety, which is fundamental to the work that our crews do every day.","Over the past few years, we've worked to create an environment where all employees feel comfortable speaking up when something doesn't look right or they identify a potential safety risk. We were gratified to see that this was one of the areas where we received the most positive feedback in our employee survey last year.","By encouraging this \"find it and fix it\" mindset and recognizing employees who do speak up or stop jobs when safety is a concern, we're identifying and addressing issues early. We measure ourselves on a set of safety metrics associated with both public and employee safety, and you can see several of those in our appendix in the slide deck.","For example, we target responding to emergency gas calls within 21 minutes. During the first quarter, we had responders on site within an average of less than 20 minutes. That's a level of performance toward the very top of the industry.","On the electric side, we target improvement every year in the number of sustained outages caused by downed wires. In the first quarter of this year, our results showed a nearly 25% improvement. Over the past five years, safety metrics have been an increasing component of our variable compensation plan.","In gas operations, we continue to do significant work on our pipeline system, testing, replacing and automating components. For several years, we have been diligently addressing the recommendations made by the NTSB following the San Bruno accident. The NTSB has closed 9 of the 12 recommendations. The remaining three recommendations, which involve strength testing, valve installation and control room procedures, are longer-term multi-year efforts, and they continue to be on track.","In electric operations, we continue to see strong reliability performance, with our customers experiencing fewer and shorter outages. And the California ISO awarded us two of the three competitive transmission projects we submitted bids for last year, both of which are in our service territory.","As California enters its fourth year of drought, we're working hard to help the state meet this challenge by reducing water usage at our own facilities, encouraging customers to conserve by offering rebates for more efficient washers and agricultural pumps. We're stepping up our vegetation management activities to mitigate wildfire risk and improve access for firefighters, and we're managing water in our own hydro system to help meet the peak load this summer.","Shifting to regulatory matters, as Tony mentioned, the Commission issued a $1.6 billion final penalty decision in the gas transmission pipeline investigation, and Kent will take you through the specific components of that in a minute.","The Commission also announced two new investigations, one on regulatory communications and one on our safety culture. The work we've undertaken to improve our safety culture over the past 4.5 years has been informed by significant benchmarking and input from experts from the outside, and we look forward to the opportunity to share our progress with the Commission.","Moving to the Gas Transmission and Storage rate case, we completed hearings in March. PG&E presented a strong case informed by a detailed risk assessment of the assets across our system. The next steps are opening briefs, which will be filed today, and then reply briefs on May 20. The current schedule calls for a final decision in the rate case in August of 2015, with revenues retroactive to January 1. It's unclear at this point how the final penalty decision will impact this schedule.","Last week, we received a proposed decision in the Residential Rate Reform proceeding at the Commission. The proposed decision acknowledges the need for fundamental rate reform and recommends reducing residential tiers from four to two over the next few years. However, we were disappointed that it failed in the near-term to adopt monthly charges to recover fixed costs. Fixed charges are a common element of many utilities' rates, and we continue to believe they can be implemented with minimal impact to customers and that the time is right to adopt them in California. We'll be filing comments on the proposed decision in May.","And finally, as we look forward, in September of this year we'll be filing our next General Rate Case, which will set forth our plans for gas and electric distribution and generation from 2017 through 2019.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Kent.","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, and good morning. Today I plan to cover our quarterly results, including the impact of the final penalty decision in the gas transmission pipeline investigation. I'll walk you through all of that, and then I'll spend some time on our outlook for 2015.","First, our quarterly results, which are summarized on slide five. Earnings from operations came in at $0.87 for the quarter. GAAP earnings including our items impacting comparability came in at $0.06. Obviously, our items impacting comparability drove much of the story for the quarter, so let me go through those.","Our pipeline related expenses came in at $17 million pre-tax, or $10 million after tax, as shown in the table. And here we've included our costs to remediate encroachments on our pipeline rights of way and some remaining expense work for our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan.","Our legal and regulatory expenses were $14 million pre-tax, or $8 million after tax, in the table. These include costs incurred in connection with litigation and enforcement activities related to natural gas matters and regulatory communication.","Fines and penalties for the quarter totaled $553 million, as shown in the table below. I'll walk you through the components of that. First, the $300 million fine payable to the state resulted in a $100 million accrual in Q1. This is because we previously took a $200 million charge in 2011. Second, the $400 million customer bill credit was fully accrued in Q1. This reflects our obligation now to provide a credit to customers in February 2016. Third, the Q1 impact of the shareholder-funded safety improvements was a $53 million charge for disallowed capital, and I'm going to take a moment to explain that figure.","As you know, the final penalty decision calls for shareholders to fund $850 million of safety improvements to be determined in our 2015 Gas Transmission and Storage rate case. This will consist of about $160 million of expense work and about $690 million of capital work. We expect to the CPUC to reduce the authorized revenues in the gas transmission rate case for these disallowed costs.","In Q1, you see nothing here for disallowed expense work. This is because the item impacting comparability for the expense work will occur as the revenue is disallowed, not as the expenses are incurred. When we receive the final decision in the gas transmission rate case, we expect to book revenues retroactive to January 1, and the impact of the revenue disallowance will be reflected as an item impacting comparability at that time.","What you do see here is a $53 million charge for disallowed capital work. The item impacting comparability for capital occurs as the capital is incurred and written off. I know that's complicated, so I'll reiterate it. Disallowed expense work will show up as an item impacting comparability when the revenues are disallowed in the gas transmission rate case. Disallowed capital work will show up as an item impacting comparability when the capital is spent.","One more thing to keep in mind; the CPUC has not yet determined which costs will count towards the $850 million of shareholder-funded safety work, so we've estimated which capital expenditures incurred during the quarter we think will qualify. Once eligibility is determined in the gas transmission rate case, we'll true up any differences as necessary.","Slide 6 shows our quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations. As you can see, we're going from $0.54 in Q1 last year to $0.87 in Q1 this year, and there are a number of factors. The largest impact, $0.21, is due to the 2014 General Rate Case decision, which we didn't receive until August last year. The impact includes both higher cost recovery as well as the tax benefits associated with repairs.","In addition, $0.05 of the Q1 increase was due to growth in rate base earnings, and another $0.05 because we had a nuclear refueling outage in Q1 of last year, but not this year. There were $0.04 associated with tax timing. We expect that to net to zero by year end. You also see $0.03 for the disposition of the remaining SolarCity shares, and miscellaneous of about $0.05.","These positive factors were partially offset by $0.08 of lower cost recovery due to the timing of the Gas Transmission rate case. The case covers costs for work we previously included as items impacting comparability, such as hydrostatic testing and integrity management. Until we are authorized revenues in the Gas Transmission rate case, this work will now reduce earnings from operations. When we receive a final decision in the case, the revenue increase will be retroactive to January 1. And then finally, we had $0.02 for higher shares during the quarter.","That completes my summary of the Q1 results, and I'd now like to move on to our outlook going forward. The final penalty decision resolved a significant uncertainty for the company, particularly with respect to the fines and penalties to be borne by shareholders and our associated financing needs. Therefore, today we are providing guidance for 2015 earnings from operations of $3.50 to $3.70 per share.","I want to spend some time going through the key assumptions underlying our guidance, which are shown on slide 7, and this should look familiar to you.","Starting in the upper left, you see that we're still assuming capital expenditures of roughly $5.5 billion this year, consistent with our last call. In the upper right, you see that our estimate of weighted average authorized rate base is still about $31 billion. We've actually adjusted the gas transmission range down by about $200 million to reflect the estimated 2015 impact of the capital disallowance in the final penalty decision. Remember, this is average rate base for the year, so you only see about half of the full year impact of the disallowance.","In the lower left, you see there are no changes to our assumptions regarding authorized return on equity and equity ratio. At the bottom right of the slide, we list factors we believe will affect 2015 earnings from operations. Our objective continues to be to earn our authorized return on rate base for the enterprise as a whole plus the net impact of the factors listed here.","The first bullet under the Gas Transmission and Storage rate case highlights a key assumption underlying our guidance; namely, that we receive a reasonable decision in the case, and that it is issued before the end of the year. The current schedule calls for a final decision in August, but the judge has yet to determine how to address the shareholder-funded safety improvements mandated in the final penalty decision, and we don't know how that could impact the schedule. If we do not receive a final decision in the Gas Transmission rate case before year end, we would not record the incremental revenue for 2015 until next year. If that were to occur, we estimate that it would reduce this year's earnings from operations by roughly $0.60 per share.","The second bullet under the rate case is the reminder that we've not sought recovery of certain corrosion and strength testing work in 2015 and beyond, and we previously indicated that these expenses should average roughly $50 million annually over the three-year period, although the amount may vary year to year.","Next is the tax benefits associated with the federal repairs deduction. Last year, the net impact from this item was $0.24, and we expect it to be a similar order of magnitude this year. After that are the incentive revenues for things like our customer energy efficiency program, and the impact of monetizing the remaining SolarCity shares, which occurred in Q1. And finally, like last year, we expect earnings on construction work in progress to be roughly offset by below-the-line costs such as advertising, charitable contributions, environmental costs and so forth.","Slide 8 summarizes our overall guidance. At the top, you see our 2015 guidance for earnings from operations of $3.50 to $3.70 per share. Guidance for our items impacting comparability is shown below that, and is broken down into the three categories.","We've got more detail on these on slide 9, so let's go there now, and I'll start at the top. You can see that we're reaffirming the estimated range for pipeline-related expenses of $100 to $150 million. We're also reaffirming the estimated range for legal and regulatory-related expenses of $25 to $75 million. Next, we're establishing an estimate of roughly $1 billion in 2015 for fines and penalties associated with the final decision in the gas transmission pipeline investigations.","You can see the key components in the table below. The first two, the fine payable to the State and the customer bill credit, were accrued in the first quarter. We estimate that charges for disallowed capital work will come to about $350 million for the year, roughly half of the total disallowed capital. We also believe we'll see the full $160 million of disallowed revenues for expense work in 2015, assuming we receive a final decision in the Gas Transmission rate case before year-end. This estimate does not include potential fines and penalties in the future, such as any revenues disallowed in the Gas Transmission rate case as a penalty for ex parte communications.","Slide 10 shows you how to get from this $1 billion estimate for 2015 to the total $1.6 billion of fines and penalties coming out of the gas investigations. Going from left to right, you see the costs incurred prior to this year, the estimated impact for 2015, and then finally, the costs we expect to incur in future periods. The future items consist of charges for the disallowed capital next year as well as remedies specified in the final decision \u2013 final penalty decision.","Moving on to slide 11, we are now estimating our total equity needs for 2015 to be between $700 and $800 million. This range is consistent with the guidance and assumptions I've walked you through this morning. It compares with our prior estimate of $400 to $600 million, which of course did not include the impact of the fines and penalties coming out of the gas investigation. As the slide indicates, the fines and penalties clearly drive up our equity needs for the year.","Going in the other direction though, our overall cash flows are a bit stronger due to items such as balancing account activity and timing of expenditures during the year. This has mitigated some of our equity need for 2015. Keep in mind that we typically issue about $300 million annually using our internal programs \u2013 our 401(k) and dividend reinvestment programs. In addition, we issued $75 million in the first quarter using our continuous equity offering, or dribble program. That would leave our remaining equity needs for the year at roughly $300 million to $400 million, and we're currently evaluating options for that. By the way, we've updated the equity factors slide in the appendix to align with the components of the final penalty decision.","Slides 12 and 13 summarize our assumptions for CapEx and rate base through 2016. The CapEx numbers are the same you've seen before, and you can see that we expect 2016 to look fairly similar to 2015, depending primarily on the outcome of the Gas Transmission rate case.","The authorized rate base numbers have been adjusted to reflect the capital disallowance resulting from the final penalty decision. The impact on 2016 average rate base is a reduction of about $500 million. Our average rate base is expected to grow to right around $33 billion in 2016, and the adjustment for the final penalty decision results in an 8% CAGR over 2014 as compared to 9% previously.","We plan to provide you with CapEx and rate base numbers beyond 2016 once we file our 2017 General Rate Case this fall.","With that, I'll stop here, and we'll now open the lines for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Steve.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, I guess this is for Kent. So, on the equity issuance needs and specifically these cash flows from balancing accounts and timing, is there any way to kind of give us a sense of how much that lowered the equity need? And do those essentially kind of normalize back in future years so that \u2013 thus there's kind of like an equity need for it later on?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, Steve, and let me get to that. Let me just make sure everybody's got the overall picture clearly, which is that the range is higher than we previously said because of the impact of the final penalty decision, but these other factors, mainly cash flows, have somewhat mitigated the overall increase. And our cash flows have improved somewhat, and those do reduce our financing requirements.","And really, a key factor is within our balancing account activities, and in particular, our energy procurement costs, which are lower primarily due to lower gas prices. They've stayed very low this year, lower than was reflected in previous expectations. And then the other thing is really kind of timing of our CapEx and our other expenditures. And together, those have really improved the cash flow forecast and reduced our requirement. Those will essentially normalize over time and play out over what is usually a several year period, particularly balancing account stuff gets trued up usually over a several year period.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Maybe kind of asking the question then a different way, is there a way to get a sense of, if you look at the totality of the $1.6 billion and didn't focus on the exact timing of the equity needs, but just at overall what the equity need would be to fund the $1.6 billion?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, the key thing I would rely on is slide 20 that has our equity factors. I think you'll be able to essentially take the components in the final penalty decision and translate them into financing requirements. And I'll just say, we haven't provided guidance for equity issuance beyond this year, and I don't plan to today, but I'll kind of \u2013 I can give you some observations about it overall.","I think you know our equity needs are a function of a lot of variables in any one period, but two key ones are our capital expenditure levels and then our unrecovered costs and penalties, and that latter one can affect both our capital structure and our cash flow. And so it can trigger equity needs at different times, and that's really what this slide 20 helps you sort through.","In terms of those two factors, I'll just make the observation on the CapEx front we expect 2016 to be pretty comparable to 2015, and you have those numbers. In terms of the penalties, we estimate that about two-thirds of our equity needs associated with the final penalty decision will be addressed this year as compared to next year, and you should be able to derive that using the equity factors that we've put in slide 20.","The only other thing I'll say, I'll just remind you that all of this depends on how the disallowed safety-related expenditures end up being treated in the Gas Transmission rate case, and we just won't know that for a while yet.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. One other question, I guess maybe more for Tony. Just the \u2013 there was a lot of commentary when the final San Bruno order came out about issues with management and whether the company should stay as one company; should the gas business be split. Anything \u2013 takeaways that you might have from that? And also, I'd just like any comments on just clarifying what happened with this \u2013 the fire that occurred in Fresno, and just clarifying whether you're seeing anything within your operations that concern you about that.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, let me take the first piece, and I'll let Chris talk about the Fresno event. So with respect to the first issue, the commentary around the issuance of the OII, clearly it tells us we have a lot of work to do to build trust and a relationship at the Commission. And we've had restrictions placed on us, but it's our intent to have the maximum amount of communications with the Commission at all levels that are appropriate, consistent with all of the restrictions. And that's one of the things we know we need to work on.","We're proud of the work we've done, and we think we need to spend more time sharing some of the things that we've done, and time will tell whether we're able to develop that sort of trusting relationship.","With that, let me ask Chris to comment on the incident that occurred in Fresno.","Christopher P. Johns - President, Pacific Gas & Electric Co.","Yeah, hi, Steve. First of all, our hearts are out for the victims \u2013 or the folks that were injured there, and we always are concerned about making sure that we're doing what we can to increase our public safety. Obviously, we did not have anybody that was on-site when the accident occurred, and so we don't know exactly what happened, but we do know some things.","First of all, we do know that there was no 811 call made for that area where work was being done. We do know that there were a couple pipeline markers in place right around where the accident occurred. We do know that there was earth-moving construction equipment that was present at the time of the incident. Also, we know that we've surveyed that area several times over the last several months. We do it about every two weeks, both with walking by and flying over, and in fact, we had photos from the day before when we had last surveyed that, and did not see any construction going on at that time.","So we've been \u2013 worked with the CPUC, who is the lead regulatory agency on this item and on the investigation as to what happened, and they've authorized us to hire Exponent, who is a third party, to perform a thorough analysis of the damaged pipe so that we can determine exactly what did happen there, and that'll be available in the next month or so. So that's where we're at with that.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse. You may proceed.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Morning, guys. Just following up on Steve's equity questions, but if we \u2013 obviously, timing will have an effect on this in the balancing accounts and that sort of thing, but should we assume that you're going to target something like a 52%, or close to a 52% equity ratio at corporate over time?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Dan, this is Kent. Yeah, that is our requirement is a 52% minimum equity, common equity ratio at the utility. And there isn't a whole lot at the corporate level, so I think that's an appropriate assumption.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So calibrating that way will probably help us get to the answer. Okay. Thank you. And then, I guess just with the...","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Dan, just one other thing. Just remember, when you do the calculations, you exclude short-term debt. That's not included as part of the authorized capital structure.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Right. Thank you. I guess, next question, I guess now that San Bruno is resolved, the dividend hasn't been addressed in an awfully long time. Tony, how are you going to plan to have that conversation with the Board, and what kind of advice are you going to give them as you go into that next meeting?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we obviously recognize the dividend is an important piece of how shareholders value us, and it's my intention to start having those discussions with our Board. And as I said in the past, my focus is to get our payout ratio in line with those of our peers. Obviously, we'll have to talk about the timing with our Board, but we're going to be starting those discussions. It will take some time to take all the variables into account, but we understand that's very important.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. So does that mean it \u2013 I guess you have a May Board meeting. Does that conversation now start now that this is behind you?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'm not going to go into the details of our agenda for our Board meetings, but I think it's fair to say this will be one of our priorities to discuss.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And I guess just one last question. When you guys file the GRC, the next GRC, how will you guys incorporate the Grid of Things-type of spending priorities in that budget? Will they be included in at that point in time, or do you think you need to see more clarity after the July 1 filing before you start to put them into a formal capital program?","Christopher P. Johns - President, Pacific Gas & Electric Co.","Dan, this is Chris. We will start that process. We are doing our annual planning process which is a look out for five years, and so there's some beginning of that spend during that five year plan on the Grid of Things, and that will feed into what we'll have in the GRC. I don't think in this GRC we see some huge explosion of investments there, but you'll start to see some investments in some of the ideas.","Don't forget, we've already made huge investments in our Grid of Things with our SmartMeter program and with a lot of the switches, the Cornerstone program, a lot of that has already laid out the foundation for where we're going to go with it.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. You may proceed.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning. So, just reviewing your commentary earlier on how we think about equity, if I look at page 10, I look at the different line items, what's been previously incurred versus estimated for 2015 versus estimated for future periods, and then I look at page \u2013 I believe it was page 20, and I use the equity factors, that should get me to what the equity needs are in estimated 2015 and beyond, correct?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, Greg, this is Kent. I think that's the best way to go.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. So when I do that, I get the difference between what you're issuing in equity on the margin today versus your prior disclosure is smaller than that number, so presumably, the rest of that cash flow is coming in from the reversal and balancing accounts and other cash flows, correct?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Those are the two primary drivers that I've articulated on the call, so I could see how you come to that conclusion.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. I just wanted to make sure my algebra was right and there wasn't some other factor to consider. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. You may proceed.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning. Just \u2013 I feel bad not asking an equity question. If I just look at what your CapEx forecast, I think that's the biggest driver in your equity needs, the CapEx forecasts for 2015 and 2016 are near identical. Is it reasonable to assume the range that you gave not including the San Bruno fine is a reasonable gauge of what your equity needs would be, you know, a $5.5 billion CapEx in 2016?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Anthony, this is Kent. I don't want to get into providing guidance for 2016, and so I'm a little tentative about how to respond to that. But I indicated before on one of the earlier questions that the CapEx profile is the same, so that basic underlying driver will look very comparable. And then what you'll want to do is look at differences in some of the other variables that affect our equity needs, one of which obviously is unrecovered costs or fines and penalties. And I think we've laid out the data for you to do that pretty well today.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Okay, great. And just lastly, I think on Monday \u2013 and I may have this wrong \u2013 the company had filed a response in the federal indictment. Is there any color you could give on that filing that you made on Monday?","Hyun Park - Senior Vice President & General Counsel","Sure. This is Hyun Park. So we made four motions for discovery of various materials. So for example, the government is obligated to provide us with what's called Brady materials. Those are evidence that are favorable to the company, and so we've asked for discovery of those materials, as well as certain portions of the grand jury transcript. And we've also asked for witness interview notes, as well as recordings of interviews. And we've also asked them to specify what other acts or incidents that they intend to introduce at trial. And so, all of this will get heard according to the current schedule on June 1 at the federal court.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldenberg with Luminus Management. You may proceed.","Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management LLC","Good morning.","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Morning, Michael.","Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management LLC","I have questions on the $1.6 billion chart; trying to understand exactly what's included and what's not included. Is rights of way in there? Is any of corrosion or hydro-strength testing is in there, or is any of the costs of GT&S delayed the five months? Are any of those things in the $1.6 billion?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, they're not. So these are the components that were included in the PUC's final penalty decision. I separately went through in the guidance for our items impacting comparability: the impact of the rights of way work as well as there's some remaining PSEP work. And then I also indicated in the guidance for earnings from operations the assumptions there that the additional gas-related costs that we've not sought recovery for, which are certain corrosion work as well as certain hydrostatic testing work, that we expected that to average about $50 million a year for each of the three years, that that would be embedded in our earnings from operations.","Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management LLC","Right, right, right. I agree with all of those, I just wanted to be crystal clear that that's not included. So is there any way you can put a number holistically if we \u2013 you keep referring us to slide 20, but I guess two things that I didn't appreciate, that $200 of the $300 million fine, that will not need equity issuance, right? Because that was already \u2013 since you already took a hit for that, you don't need equity issuance, that's number one. And number two, so is there any way to put the amount of dollars for this cash flow benefit from balancing accounts?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So let me parse through those two. In the first comment you made, which was your conclusion that we don't need equity needs associated with the first $200 million that we accrued a while back, that's actually not quite the case. And when you look at the equity factors, because to date that's been a non-cash accrual, roughly half of that essentially has been financed and...","Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management LLC","Okay.","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","...the remaining half gets financed at the time we actually pay the fine. So there is some remaining need that comes from that fine payable, the original $200 million.","Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management LLC","Okay, that makes sense. Okay.","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Okay. Second \u2013 what was the second part of your question again?","Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management LLC","The second part was... is there any \u2013 a way to predict the dollar amount on this cash flow benefit from regulatory from balancing?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, what I would suggest you think about is go to our old guidance for equity, look at \u2013 which did not include any of the equity needs associated with the final penalty decision, use the equity factors on slide 20 to estimate what the incremental equity needs are. And there'll be a difference between that and the guidance that we're currently giving you for our overall equity needs, and one of the key drivers of that will be those factors related to cash flows.","Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management LLC","Okay. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, hey, guys. One question about 2015 guidance. If you just, like, back of the envelope rate base math, I'll use Greg Gordon's algebra for an example here. If I do $31 billion at a 52% equity ratio and at a 10.4% authorized ROE using your current share count, I get a number that's actually below your guidance range. So can you just walk me through what the delta there is? And then, does that delta, does that difference, do you expect that to continue multiple years going forward, or is that something that's a 2015 event only?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, so this is Kent. I'd suggest you focus on slide 7. And on slide 7, essentially the math you just went through is for all intents and purposes the upper part of the chart and the lower left part of the chart, you did the math on it. The other part though is the lower right part of the chart, the other factors affecting our earnings from operations. And I sort of gave commentary on each of those factors. The biggest driver is related to the net benefits of the repairs, the tax benefit. And we've indicated that we would expect it this year to have an impact that's comparable, same order of magnitude to last year when it was $0.24 a share.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then beyond this year, meaning that stops after the \u2013 in 2016, or does that carry forward into 2016 and beyond?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","That item relates to our 2014 General Rate Case, so we would expect it to be in place through 2016.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","At a comparable level, meaning at that $0.24 level?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Similar order of magnitude.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, Kent. Much appreciated.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hugh Wynne with AllianceBernstein. You may proceed.","Hugh de Neufville Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. I was hoping to get some clarity on the pending investigations and cases that may result in future fines and perhaps get your view on the maximum amount of those fines. Is it correct to say that we have the federal case, the ex parte withholding of GT&S revenue, the OII into the safety records on the gas distribution side, and then the investigation into the \u2013 the OII into the safety culture of PG&E, or are there other investigations and cases that we need to be aware of in addition to those four?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Hugh, I think that covers the list that we're aware of. I'm looking at Hyun Park, our General Counsel. I think he's accurately covered the list.","Hyun Park - Senior Vice President & General Counsel","Hugh, and Tony mentioned earlier that the State AG as well as the federal prosecutors are looking at ex parte issues, so that investigation is still ongoing.","Hugh de Neufville Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just kind of a, is it bigger than a breadbox type of estimates here. The maximum penalty in the federal case, I think the federal attorney said that she was seeking up to $1.1 billion. Is that correct? Is there any color you can give us on that?","Hyun Park - Senior Vice President & General Counsel","Yes, so it's $1.13 billion is what they've alleged, and the color is that we disagree with that.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And remember, the $1.13 billion is the alternative fine provision where you calculate either gain that we got or losses that were incurred. But of course, with respect to that, we settled all of the civil cases, so they're \u2013 arguably there are no losses left to cover. Certainly, there wasn't gain to the company. I mean, look at the size of this penalty and you'd know that there was no gain to the company.","So if you go back to the fundamental provisions of the Pipeline Safety Act under which that case was brought, the fines I think are $500,000 a count, and there are 20-some counts, and so you can run the numbers that way, as what we believe would be a more likely \u2013 if in fact there is liability, which of course we contest fairly strongly.","Hugh de Neufville Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. So you're basically pushing us in the direction of a nominal fine, maybe $1 million, because of the inability to apply the more onerous metrics for calculating a larger fine?","Hyun Park - Senior Vice President & General Counsel","So, Hugh, if you do the math under the more conventional fine method, it's $500,000 per count, 28 counts, so that adds up to I believe $14 million.","Hugh de Neufville Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","$14 million, okay.","Hyun Park - Senior Vice President & General Counsel","Yeah. And then they've alleged the alternative fines, which Tony described. And by the way, some of this is discussed in some of the motions that we filed on Monday, so you can see some of the discussion on that.","Hugh de Neufville Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","On the ex parte communication, is it correct to say that the CPUC is still reserving the right to withhold approximately $230 million from the GT&S revenue, or is there some new benchmark there?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hugh, this is Kent. I think what they said that they would fine us up to 5 months of whatever the ultimate revenue increase coming out of the case is, and we don't know what that is yet.","Hugh de Neufville Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Right. So that's still \u2013 the final determination there is still pending, but it could be 5 months of GT&S revenue increase as a result of the case.","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","That will be determined at the end of the case.","Hugh de Neufville Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. On the distribution safety OII, are there any parameters we can use? Should we make reference to the OII into the transmission system, or is this going to be a different order of magnitude?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that's one \u2013 the case is just getting under way. We can't even give you an order of magnitude of what might come out of that, if in fact there is any liability at all.","Hugh de Neufville Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And what about the OII into safety culture? That seems a very intangible OII to me, and I wonder, is it \u2013 do we expect penalties to be sought there, or is that a different type of investigation?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And again, it's very early. I mean, the way I heard it, it sounds like a different type of investigation around what we've done with respect to our safety culture. And as I said before, that's an area we actually feel very good about. We've spent a lot of effort on safety culture issues, starting with doing some very significant benchmarking of other companies to look at what they do, and I will tell you that we've learned a lot from that benchmark, but we also learned that we compare quite favorably to our peers with respect to what we're doing.","We hired a number of third-party experts to come in and look at safety culture, from a former head of the NTSB to Lloyd's Registry (sic) [Register] (48:24) in London who's done work under ISO 55000, and things like changing our discipline policy to encourage employees to identify safety issues, to a program to identify near-hits, as we call them, on safety. That has greatly expanded our understanding of where the rifts are in the company. And a number of other things; training of all of our leaders on safety culture. So we've done a lot that hasn't shown up in specific proceedings, and we think this will be an opportunity at some point when the OII gets underway to talk about what we've done.","Hugh de Neufville Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then just one final question. Are you considering as a matter of strategy trying to settle these various cases and investigations so that the hit to equity can be known, or do you feel it's in the best interest of shareholders just to kind of fight these out to the bitter end and let the adversarial process take its course?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You know, I think that what our recent decisions show is we want to aggressively defend the shareholders' interests, but at some point certainty is in the shareholders' interest. And that was kind of behind our decision not to appeal the San Bruno OIIs, even though there were some issues we thought might be appealable. In the end, it was better to have certainty so we can continue to focus on improving the system. We're always open to settlements in these cases. We're not open to admitting to things that just didn't occur. I think that's our position in the criminal case, that we don't see anyone who didn't \u2013 who made any intentional decisions to violate the Pipeline Safety Act. But we will continue to look for opportunities to get certainty by resolving some of these proceedings.","Hugh de Neufville Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much for the color. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS. You may proceed.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, guys. I was wondering if you could talk about what's the normalized tax rate that you expect to have in the next GRC, you know, once the repair benefits are absorbed?","Dinyar B. Mistry - Vice President & Controller","This is Dinyar Mistry, the Controller. We expect the repairs flow through rate making to continue in the next General Rate Case, and so it should have a similar order of magnitude on our effective tax rate. What you have been seeing in this year, the $0.24 that Kent mentioned, is the difference between the repairs that was forecasted in the last General Rate Case and the repairs that we are experiencing as we file our tax returns, but that should be trued-up in the 2017 rate case.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Right. And once it's trued-up, what will the normalized tax rate be?","Dinyar B. Mistry - Vice President & Controller","So the...","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","The 35%, or no?","Dinyar B. Mistry - Vice President & Controller","No. 35% is the statutory rate. If you go to our financial statements at the end of last year, you'll see that our effective rate was roughly 20%, and it should be probably similar. I don't know how it's going to shake out because it is a technical calculation. But it does not mean that there's a benefit to the bottom line because there's an associated reduction on the revenue side.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","I see. So you will be effectively earning at the 35% rate, even if your GAAP rate is 20%?","Dinyar B. Mistry - Vice President & Controller","I think the better way to think about it is that there is no benefit or harm from the effective tax rate being different from the statutory tax rate. It's just a calculation.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. We'll follow up offline on that. The other question I had was about future CapEx growth profile after 2016? The Edison call, they discussed kind of having a flat profile for the next decade, at the $4 billion level, and that includes presumably the \u2013 well, it might exclude the benefits that might come from investing in the distribution resource plan that's coming out in July. So I'm just wondering if you guys have a similar view of the next decade, especially considering the EV filing that you made, that your CapEx profile will be growing, or will it be kind of flattish over the next decade, or not?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","This is Kent. We will be providing you with numbers when we get to the fall. I would say our observations is that we are doing a lot of infrastructure investment, essentially hardening our system, replacing a lot of stuff that was put in post-World War II and so forth. And we don't expect that program to finish by the time we're done with 2016, so we'll continue to see I think a healthy CapEx profile going forward. But we're not prepared to actually provide you numbers at this point until we finish up on our GRC filing.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin with Merrill Lynch. You may proceed.","Brian J. Chin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Morning, Brian.","Brian J. Chin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Is there an implied timing of the equity issuance embedded in the 2015 guidance that you can give a little more color on?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, there isn't. As I indicated before, we're still evaluating our options for the financing, and that's with respect to about the timing and the approach.","Brian J. Chin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay. Great. The rest of my questions were asked and answered. Thank you.","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar. You may proceed.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Research","Good morning. Thank you. Obviously a lot of talk \u2013 plenty of talk about the equity side. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the credit side and the timing there in terms of issues and needs?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, Travis, this is Kent again. I think if you look last year, our net debt issuance was about $1.4 billion. That's net of maturities, and that's probably not far off from what we've done the last several years. So I would say similar order of magnitude, given similar CapEx program. We have a little bit higher CapEx this year. So similar profile, but we're not going to be talking about timing until we're closer to actually starting a transaction.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Research","Okay. Remind me real quick, when do you need to have the capital structure in place for rate making purposes? What's the timing on that?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, it's essentially over the period during which the capital structure is authorized. So for us, it's over this cost of capital period which has been \u2013 essentially will end up being a four-year period right now.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Research","Okay. One other real quick one. The talk about the tax deductions and debate there with the CPUC, if they were to disallow some of that tax write-off, how does that change that slide 20?","Dinyar B. Mistry - Vice President & Controller","So, this is Dinyar Mistry again, the Controller, and let's just go through the components of the penalty that you see on slide 20. And if you look at that, the fine payable to the State general fund is not tax deductible, but we continue to believe the other disallowances included in the Commission's final decision are tax deductible.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Research","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldenberg with Luminus Management. You may proceed.","Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management LLC","Good morning again. I just wanted to confirm when you guys talk about equity issuance, do you just talk about straight equity, or are you considering other options?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Michael, this is Kent, and we are in general, as you know, for these unrecovered fines and penalties, we've been saying that primarily we're relying on equity issuance. And over the past couple years, I've had conversations with investors and certainly with you about options such as mandatory converts, for example. But I will say at this point, I think that option is probably less likely now, just given the size of our remaining equity need for this year.","Janet C. Loduca - Vice President-Investor Relations","Hey, Monique, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of John Apgar with Balyasny Asset Management. You may proceed.","John Apgar - Balyasny Asset Management, L.P. (U.S.)","Good morning. Michael asked my question, but I just wanted you to elaborate a bit more on the equity needs for 2015 and your options. I mean, you have a $300 million DRIP, and can you remind us of the size of the ATM program that you have in place?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, yeah, the equity options that we have used in the past include our internal programs, which are both the DRIP and the 401(k) program. We typically have issued roughly $300 million a year from those programs. We have had a continuous equity offering, and we have a program there for $500 million, and I believe in the first quarter, we did approximately $80 million of that through the dribble program. So those are the two components you are relying on \u2013 or you are referencing.","John Apgar - Balyasny Asset Management, L.P. (U.S.)","So between the continuous equity and the DRIP program, you have $800 million of total capacity? Is that the right way to look at it?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","That's correct. Of course, the continuous equity offering is not limited to $500 million, that's just our current program, and we've actually renewed that program several times over the last few years.","John Apgar - Balyasny Asset Management, L.P. (U.S.)","Okay. Fair enough. And then, regarding the balancing accounts, can you quantify that at all as far as the cash impact?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You know, I think I've had several folks take a run at me on that one on this call, and I think I pretty much laid out how you can get rough estimates of the various factors driving our equity previously on the Q&A, and I'll...","John Apgar - Balyasny Asset Management, L.P. (U.S.)","Well, it's ...","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","... sit tight with what I've already indicated.","John Apgar - Balyasny Asset Management, L.P. (U.S.)","Well, I was just looking at your net receivable balance off of the balancing accounts, and it's $1.2 billion in 2014, much higher than it was in 2013. So is it right to look at it as a big cash outflow in 2014 and that is reversing in 2015? And then, once that net receivable goes to zero, it's not necessarily a net cash outflow next year, right? It just stays at zero? Is that the right way to look at it?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","There are a lot of factors and complexity in all of our various balancing accounts, so I think that actually if you're starting with those numbers on the balance sheet, you could spend a lot of time trying to figure out the timing during which different ones amortize, and I'm not sure they get you where you really need to be. So I would suggest a simpler way is to go back to our prior estimates of equity, look at the new estimates of equity, and look at our equity factors for the fines and penalties, and you'll at least know how much the equity factors are driving the change from our prior estimate to our new estimate. And...","John Apgar - Balyasny Asset Management, L.P. (U.S.)","Okay.","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","...any difference you see there, I've indicated on the call a significant driver of that has been our cash flows forecast.","John Apgar - Balyasny Asset Management, L.P.

Loduca - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, everyone. This is Janet Loduca, and thank you for joining us for the Pacific Gas and Electric Corporation's Third Quarter Earnings Call. Before I turn over to Tony Earley, I want to remind you that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results, which is based on assumptions, forecasts, expectations, and information currently available to management.","Some of the important factors that could affect the company's actual financial results are described on the second page of today's slide deck. We also encourage you to review the Form 10-Q that will be filed with the SEC later today and the discussion of risk factors that appears there and in the 2014 Annual Report.","With that, I'll hand it over to Tony.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Janet, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our key focus areas remain unchanged. California continues to lead the U.S. in driving clean energy policies and PG&E will play a critical role in helping to achieve the state's goals. We also know that safety must be at the core of all of our decisions and our commitment to that is unwavering. We continue to make progress towards resolving outstanding regulatory and legal issues, while strengthening our safety and compliance programs. We believe that executing our strategies in these focus areas will provide the foundation for both operational and financial success.","So I'm going to touch on some of the key developments this quarter before I turn it over to Kent, to discuss our financial results. Geisha Williams and Nick Stavropoulos are also with us today and they'll be available to take any questions that you have.","In terms of our focus on clean energy, PG&E has a long history of action on climate change and we've been a vocal advocate for policies that will move us forward. In fact, I recently participated in a meeting with President Obama and talked about the actions PG&E is taking to help drive clean energy policy and greenhouse gas reductions. We supported Governor Brown's recent move to increase the renewable energy target to 50% by 2030 and we're confident that we can get there. We've been investing in the electric grid to enable both utility scale renewables and the growing distributed resources such as rooftop solar, electric vehicles and energy storage.","During the quarter, we filed our proposal to update the current net metering rates. Our proposal supports the continued growth of rooftop solar, while beginning the transition to a sustainable rate structure that also supports the necessary grid investments.","Our 2017 General Rate Case includes detailed proposals for continued grid modernization to ensure that we have the visibility and flexibility we'll need to enable all of the new distributed resources. Our General Rate Case also supports our goal on delivering customer expectations by providing customers with safe, reliable, and affordable service. Using a risk based approach, we proposed safety related investments across the system, including replacing aging infrastructure, taking targeted actions to reduce risk and improving our emergency response, and we balanced the necessary investments with affordability. Average residential bills will increase less than 3% and will remain below the national average.","In terms of reliability, the most significant event this quarter were the fires in Northern California. As you know, California is in its fourth year of a severe drought and we've been partnering throughout the year with CAL FIRE and other stakeholders to address a challenging fire season. Our efforts have included things like increased patrols and vegetation management, as well as enhanced emergency response coordination.","At one point, the state was simultaneously fighting three major wildfires across 300,000 acres of our service territory. In addition to restoring power to impacted customers, our crews came up with creative ways to meet our community's needs in a very challenging time. So for example, we leveraged the new exportable power technology from our electric trucks, to provide an evacuation shelter with backup electricity when its generator failed.","The response from our customers and other stakeholders has been positive and we're really proud of how safely and quickly our crews were able to perform the work. As we've publically reported, CAL FIRE is investigating whether one of our electric clients could potentially been the source of the Butte Fire. That investigation is still underway and could take quite a while to complete, so we don't have any updates on that at this time.","On the heels of the state's historic drought, we're now hearing forecasts about an El Ni\u00f1o winter, which could bring significant rainfall and cause mudslides and floods. Our team has been preparing for this possibility through a wide array of actions, including updating our meteorological models and performing drills that simulate potential flood scenarios.","Finally, in terms of resolving outstanding regulatory issues, we recently received a report from the Safety and Enforcement Division in the Gas Distribution Record-keeping Investigation. While the report identified a number of potential past violations, which we'll be responding to in the next month, we were pleased to see that it also acknowledged the progress we've made to improve our records.","Over the last few years, we've implemented a number of new procedures that have been informed by extensive benchmarking and industry best practices. As we said from the beginning, we know we have more work to do to enhance our distribution records and practices, and we're absolutely committed to getting that right.","Geisha and Nick recently had a chance to share some of the actions we've taken to improve our safety culture at the California Public Utilities Commission's first-ever safety en banc. This was an opportunity for all five commissioners, the presidents of California's investor-owned utilities and a number of interveners to talk about what each of the utilities is currently doing around safety, and what changes the Commission might make to better incorporate safety into its proceedings.","Nick and Geisha talked about the changes made by our board of directors to focus on safety, the strong link between our executive compensation programs and safety performance, our use of third-party experts and benchmarking and the way we engage our front-line crews around safety. The Commission also had the opportunity to hear from other utilities and to start thinking about how to create common metrics to track and measure progress. I can tell you that we thought it was a really positive step forward in the conversation and we look forward to continuing the dialog with all the parties.","So, before I turn this over to Kent, I just want to take a moment to thank him for all that he has done for PG&E. As you know after 33 years with the company, Kent has decided to retire next year. Kent has done a tremendous job managing PG&E's financial activities during challenges that were some of the most complex in our industry. He has also been a great source of leadership and inspiration across the company. We're working through the succession process right now, and I'm thankful that Kent has agreed to stay on to ensure a smooth transition.","So, thank you, Kent and with that I'll turn it over to you.","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Tony. Good morning, everyone. I plan to first cover our results for the quarter and then I'll go through our updated guidance. Let me say upfront that the complexity of our rate case timing issues has made it especially difficult for you to forecast quarterly results. However, we do expect solid results for the full-year and you'll see that when I get to guidance.","So, I'll start with our quarterly results, which is on slide five. Earnings from operations were $0.84 in the third quarter and GAAP earnings, including our items impacting comparability, were $0.63.","Our pipeline-related expenses in the quarter were $32 million pre-tax, or $19 million after tax shown in the table. This includes our costs to remediate encroachments on our pipeline rights-of-way and to complete the remaining expense work for our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan.","Our legal and regulatory-related expenses in the quarter were $14 million pre-tax, or $8 million after tax in the table, and here we have our costs for litigation and enforcement activities related to natural gas matters and regulatory communications.","Fines and penalties in the quarter were $142 million pre-tax as shown in the table below. This amount represents the disallowed capital work coming out of the final San Bruno penalty decision, which we're accruing as we do the work.","Finally, we received insurance recoveries in the quarter of $10 million pre-tax, or $6 million after tax, as shown in the table above. I'm pleased that we've now resolved all San Bruno claims with our insurance carriers, and in total, we recovered $515 million through insurance.","Moving to slide six, you'll see our quarter-over-quarter comparison of earnings from operations of $1.73 in Q3 last year and $0.84 in Q3 this year and this is where it gets a little complicated due to all the timing issues. In Q3 last year, we've recorded three quarters worth of revenue increase associated with our 2014 General Rate Case. That's the biggest difference from Q3 of last year, worth $0.47. $0.16 is associated with the lower cost recovery this year due to the timing of the Gas Transmission rate case.","As you know, a lot of our transmission work is seasonal and the Q3 amount reflects a higher level of activity in the summer months. When we receive a final decision in the case next year, the revenue increase will be retroactive to January 1, 2015.","$0.09 relates to the timing of taxes, which will reverse to zero by year-end. $0.05 relates to regulatory and legal matters. This includes the impact of some favorable regulatory decisions in Q3 of last year, as well as some legal costs incurred in Q3 of this year. Another $0.05 is associated with an increase in shares outstanding and the impact here of share count is magnified by the fact that earnings in Q3 last year were so much higher as a result of booking three quarters worth of revenue increase to the GRC.","$0.03 relates to the disposition of SolarCity stock in Q3 last year, and $0.09 relates to a variety of smaller miscellaneous items, many of which are timing. And we've had positive miscellaneous items in previous quarters. These factors are partially offset by a $0.05 increase due to growth in rate base earnings. That's it for our Q3 results.","On slide seven, you'll see our 2015 guidance. Previously, we've had a guidance range for earnings from operations of $2.90 to $3.10. Year-to-date, we've been trending towards the upper end of this range. Therefore, today, we're narrowing our range to between $3.00 \u2013 $3.10. There are few other changes to this slide. We've reduced our range for pipeline related expenses, and I'll say more about that in a moment. We've also updated our insurance recoveries just to reflect the amount we've recovered in the quarter. Our resulting GAAP guidance is shown at the bottom of the table.","On slide eight, we've updated our 2015 CapEx assumptions from $5.5 billion previously to $5.3 billion. There are really two main reasons for this update. First, our response to the recent wildfires displaced some of our planned work in electric operations. And second, we're realizing some efficiencies in gas operations, primarily related to our distribution pipe replacement program. The other assumptions for 2015 on this slide remained consistent with what we've previously provided.","Slide nine reflects the updated range for pipeline-related expenses that I mentioned earlier. You can see we've decreased the upper end of that range from a $150 million to $125 million. The lower end remains at $100 million. You'll recall that this item is primarily associated with our rights-of-way work, and we continue to expect that the cost of the overall program will not exceed $500 million.","Moving on to slide 10. Our total equity needs for 2015 remain the same at $700 million to $800 million. Through the end of Q3, we've issued roughly $700 million of equity. This includes about $350 million through a block trade done in August, about $75 million through our continuous equity offering program earlier in the year, and then about $275 million through our internal programs. Those are our 401(k) and dividend reinvestment programs. We do not expect to issue any additional equity this year other than through our internal programs.","Slide 11 shows our estimated CapEx through 2019 and other than the change to 2015 that I previously covered, the ranges for 2016 through 2019 remain the same.","Slide 12 shows our estimates of authorized rate base through 2019 and these are consistent with the CapEx ranges on the previous slide. As a result, we estimate that 6% to 8% annual growth in our authorized rate base over this period. As Tony discussed, California's clean energy policies and our focus on system safety and reliability are driving significant investment in the coming years and support this strong growth profile.","I'll stop here so that we can now open the lines for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Jonathan.","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","A quick question, just on the CapEx and I guess therefore the rate base ranges. Could you talk to what it is in the base, the bottom-end of the range? Is that just authorized spending? And then the other things that you mentioned are what defines the shaded sections, or is there some other way of being a little more clear about what exactly is in and out of the two pieces, two different levels?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, Jonathan, this is Kent. Let me kind of go through by parts of the business, which really relate to the regulatory proceedings.","So, for the electric and gas distribution and generation, which is our General Rate Case, the high end reflects the amounts that we've requested in the 2017 General Rate Case. For gas transmission, the high end in 2017 reflects the amount that we requested in the gas transmission rate case. And then in 2018 and 2019, we've just kept that amount flat with the 2017 request. And then for electric transmission, which is our TO Case, we've really only requested an amount through 2016, our TO17 case. And so, our 2017 through 2019 levels are flat at the 2016 request. For the low end basically, it's consistent with the low end that we've had out there already for 2016 across the board.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And how about your distributions resource plan, for example? Where does that fit into this \u2013 the range? Is that in the high end or not?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We did not have a specific ask in that proceeding, but a lot of those types of investments for automating the system and so forth, are included in our General Rate Case. So those components are included in the overall ask, and therefore in the overall range, the upper end of the range.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So put simply, if you got everything you've asked for in both of the big outstanding cases, you would come in at the high end?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","That's correct. And then of course, we'll have updates because at some point we'll file another gas transmission case for beyond 2017, and we'll also file additional transmission owner cases for beyond 2016.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you, Kent. That was my question. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Good morning, guys. Can I just ask about with the El Ni\u00f1o concerns about the storms in the preparations there? How do you guys address cost recovery if you end up with some disproportionally high storm costs this year, I guess, next year? And how would that affect the numbers as we think about ongoing earnings estimates?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","This is Kent. We do have the balancing account treatment in our current General Rate Case for major storms. In addition, for things like the wildfires, we just had where \u2013 in cases where the Governor declares a disaster area, we also have the ability to seek recovery through a catastrophic event memorandum account. So, there is a few different mechanisms that are in place in California.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you. And I guess the next question, Tony, with the electric vehicle charging station decision it was kind of a deviation from what you guys seem have been messaged from the Governor as far as his priorities are concerned, A, how do think this is going to work out from meeting the Governor's rules on vehicles? But second, when you look at the DRP is there a disconnect between the goals of the Governor and what the Commission's proving to be supportive of you guys investing in?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, obviously, we thought that our initial proposal was totally consistent with the Governor's goals on electric vehicles. I think the Commission felt it was overly aggressive and wants to phase it in, and in terms of our spending estimates since, it takes a while to gear up, it really doesn't affect any of the numbers that Kent is talking about. We just want to get the program up and running, and we think that once we get it running, we'll show that it's very well received and is consistent with the electric vehicle strategy in California. So it was disappointing, we didn't get the full green light, but we're going to continue to work to get still a fairly aggressive program out there.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then I guess, just what it means as far as the pacing of DRP capital. Is there going to be more of a test for each one of these new initiatives along the way rather than maybe a more wholesale buy in of what you need to do to accomplish the bigger state goals?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think, as Kent just said a minute ago that the DRP capital is spread among the various regulatory cases. So our General Rate Case has some of it in \u2013 and that's where it will be addressed, and it's being addressed now. We've submitted that case and it will go through the hearing process. So I don't expect a separate rate making proceeding for DRP. DRP expenditures will just be rolled into various other proceedings.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And I guess one last question, just with the Edison case where the manufacturing tax deductions are, they're trying to slap them as a reduction in rate base and the next rate case to claw back those earnings. How is that affecting you guys from maybe the way you're thinking about recognizing those earnings, those benefits during this GRC process and if there was a precedent that the Commission was pulling those back, would you guys need to change how you're recognizing them in your numbers?","Dinyar B. Mistry - Vice President & Controller","Hi, Dan. This is Dinyar Mistry, the Controller. We've taken a look at the Edison PD and we think that our situation is different from Edison. We just filed our 2017 GRC, so prospectively the Commission will consider our request over there. But at this point in time, we don't anticipate changing our treatment.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi, good morning. So, first of all, Kent, I guess an early good-bye. We will miss you. Secondly, on the similar question regarding the Edison PD on their GRC. Is there any policy issues there that concern you at all, relative to your case?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","The major issue we've seen has been the repairs issue, which Dinyar just addressed and we do think we are in a little bit different situation. That's the biggest one that we've been watching.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. And then the \u2013 maybe just on the criminal case. I know there has been a lot of activity. Can you maybe just give us an update on whether any of the allegations have been thrown out at this point and do we still have some kind of trial in March of next year?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. This is Tony. Let me start off and then I'll let Hyun jump in. Those of you who have been involved in major litigations, this is just the pre-trial motions stage, there is a lot of activity going on, there will continue to be more activity leading up to the trial. The trial is still scheduled for next spring. We'll see what happens as we get closer to it, but, Hyun, why don't you comment on where we are.","Hyun Park - Senior Vice President & General Counsel","Yeah. So, Steve, we did file a number of motions, and all the motions have been submitted to the Judge, so we're just waiting for the Judge to issue his ruling on our motions.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. And then on the GT&S case, I know there is oral arguments today, but in terms of \u2013 is any relevant updates there in terms of potential outcomes we should be aware of?","Steven E. Malnight - Senior Vice President-Regulatory Affairs, Pacific Gas & Electric Co.","Hi, this is Steve Malnight from Reg Affairs. Really, we don't have any additional updates, timing still looks like next year for the case. We'll look forward to the oral argument later today.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Congratulations, Kent, by the way.","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Mike.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, when do you guys think you will be in a position to discuss 2016 guidance and dividend policy?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, that's something that we look at every time I'm with my board of directors. We discussed that dividend policy. We've not tied it to any specific outcome at the Commission, what we are focusing on is, what is the right time to address that. I'm well aware that our investors have been very patient on this. We're committed to getting our dividend in line with our peers, but it's got to be at the right time and we continue to assess that.","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","In terms of timing of guidance, I'd just say we're looking towards hopefully getting back in a regular rhythm with guidance. And I'd like to think we'll be in a position to do that in the first quarter.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Great. And just one follow-up question on the repairs deduction issue. Can you just refresh how are you guys treating it and how \u2013 is there any simple way to explain why your situation is different than the Edison's?","Dinyar B. Mistry - Vice President & Controller","Yeah. This is Dinyar again. So, the rate making for repairs is that customer rates are reduced for taxes that aren't currently paid to the IRS. That's the fundamental principle of the flow through rate making, and to the extent that there is a forecast difference between what was in the rate case and what actually occur, during that rate case period, up or down that forecast difference affects the bottom line.","I would say the primary difference between us and the Edison Case is that, in the Edison PD it's indicated that its previous GRC request was based on a different methodology for calculating the tax repairs than was actually applied during that period. But for us we've applied the same methodology for our actuals that we used to develop the forecast, and so I think that's probably the key difference.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, guys. Just curious when you think about longer-term, do you expect to be a company that winds up growing earnings kind of in pace with rate base growth? Is there anything structural that can make it something different than that over time?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Michael, this is Kent. I think at the levels of rate base growth and CapEx frankly that we are having right now, they do require some equity issuance. And so, generally you'll see earnings grow with rate base, but you'd have to net out whatever equity issuance you need to support that level of CapEx. At lower levels you could see that, but we're at higher levels and I do think that requires some level of equity issuance.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. Second, Tony, you made the comment about you talked to the board about dividend and dividend policy. Can you dive a little bit into the \u2013 when you think about dividend policy, are we talking a payout ratio, a growth rate, a dividend yield target relative to the peer group? I'm just going to think about what are the metrics you and the board are looking at, when you all have the discussions about dividend policy.","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","This is Kent. I'll just say, generally, probably the primary metric we look at is payout ratio. We look at the industry and it's pretty nicely clumped. So it's pretty easy to see where the industry is and we're a bit below that. And so, that's the primary issue we'll be addressing.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay, guys. Thank you. Much appreciated.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hugh Wynne with AllianceBernstein.","Hugh D. Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Thank you. Two questions. One, I was just wondering if you might bring us up to date on any developments that could shed light on potential outcomes of the Gas Distribution Records OII? And then similarly whether there been any developments with respect to the CAL FIRE investigation into the origins of the Butte bush fire?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, let me comment on the CAL FIRE. Their investigation is ongoing, we're cooperating with it, we don't have any updates. Traditionally, those investigations take quite some time, because it's hard because all the evidence is burned up. So it takes a lot of work to figure out exactly what happened. With respect to other proceedings, Steve, you \u2013 I don't think we have any updates there.","Steven E. Malnight - Senior Vice President-Regulatory Affairs, Pacific Gas & Electric Co.","No, we don't really have any updates on the OII. We saw the SED filing as was mentioned earlier, we'll file our rebuttal testimony in November, and then we'd expect hearings on that in January, first part of the year.","Hugh D. Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Brian.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Question on dividend, going back to that. Given some of the changes that will take place in the C-Suite over the next 12 months, does that to some degree make you think that you ought to maintain flexibility on the dividend until the next set of C-Suite executives comes in or does that not factor into your thinking about how you think about the timing of a dividend policy going forward?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think it has any connection at all to dividend policy. Dividend policy is based upon our financial situation and our assessment of what's going on on the regulatory front and doesn't have anything to do with the C-Suite changes.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Understood. Secondly, on the cost of capital mechanism and the proceedings that will come up next year, it seems like mechanically, the numbers are shaping out where an extension, perhaps, may not be too difficult of a suggestion to different stakeholders. I guess what I'm wondering is, are you aware of any issues out there that may prevent some of the stakeholders from wanting to consider an extension of the current mechanism, any issues that may need to be worked through that could prevent that and instead make a full-blown cost of capital proceeding take place?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Brian, this is Kent. So as you alluded to the normal process would have us file a cost of capital application next spring and that would be for rates effective January 2017. And I think what you are alluding to, I think everybody knows that last year we and the other parties all agreed to extend the existing cost of capital as well as trigger mechanism by one year. And so the question is will that happen again this year. And I'd just say, we are open to exploring that again given that as you said forecast bond rates haven't changed all that much since the proceeding was originally litigated, but whether or not that occurs depends on the extent to which all the parties are able to reach agreement.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, I guess at this point you're not aware of any specific issues that may cause one or two of the stakeholders to say, we really ought to revisit this despite the mathematics looking fairly similar versus last year?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Brian, if I were, I wouldn't be talking about it with investors.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Understood. And then lastly, there has been a lot of consolidation happening in the industry. If, Tony, you could give just your quick thoughts on consolidation, how you think about it in the industry here. A lot of your peers have been using their balance sheets and I think it's safe to say that the California utilities are in a much better balance sheet position than others. Just your latest thoughts there?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean generally we don't comment on specifics on M&A opportunities. I will say one interesting observation though is, everyone is buying a gas company, we've already got 4.5 million gas customers. I think we're in a pretty good shape.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill with Barclays. You may proceed.","Gregg Gillander Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. You mentioned that as you get out to 2017 and 2018 your forecast for rate base on \u2013 your forecast includes flat assumptions for the gas and electric transmission. Is there maybe, since you are going to update it at some point, is there a better modeling assumption that we might use? Or with those updates maybe get you to the higher end of rate base growth that you are thinking about?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","This is Kent. We've just done that because it's a fairly mechanical way to do it, and we don't want to call future cases that we've not yet filed, so, but you can apply judgment to it, you can look at our historic track record, what we've done over the last few years, adjust that. Whatever you think is appropriate, we just try to keep it simple and objective when we present it to you for your consideration.","Gregg Gillander Orrill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have a follow-up question from the line of Michael Lapides.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my follow-up. Real quick, on the rate base chart, or exhibit, slide 12, that still excludes the incremental CWIP that actually generates some earnings. I think that is the number of around $1 billion, $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion, somewhere in that range. You have commented historically that, that earnings from CWIP, while not in rate base, would largely be offset by corporate costs that aren't recoverable in rates. Do you still see that trend or is there the potential to manage some of those corporate costs down over time?","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","This is Kent, again. No, I think nothing has really changed there. I think that's a reasonable assumption to make going forward. I think, I've said several times a lot of the stuff we do that is below the line is really important to the longer-term success of the company and our financials. It includes our advertising, a lot of our charitable contribution, just bread and butter for a utility, and we're going to continue to make those necessary investments.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, Kent. Once again, congratulations.","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Research","Good morning. Thank you. Going back to the long-term outlook for CapEx and that discussion, what is the impact from SB 350? How long out and is that included in any kind of near-term CapEx or GRC? Just your thoughts around that.","Kent M. Harvey - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, SB 350, really one of the primary components of it is the RPS requirements in the state. And generally, we have already been on track to meet the 33% RPS, this would now take us to 50% eventually. We do that primarily through long-term contracting. So it doesn't have a direct implication for our own CapEx, which are primarily our distribution and transmission businesses.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Although, I will add one place we may see some opportunities, is in additional transmission out there. We've been successful in the competitive transmission bidding process here in California in the last couple of years, we continue to intend to stay involved in that process. But all of that is outside any of the years that we've been showing on the slides, because recall that the current 33% is a 2020 objective. And so the new SB 350 requirements will start showing up in the 2020s and you'd see transmission in that timeframe.","So, I think the only conclusion you can draw is given California's commitment to a clean energy environment, it's going to require the utilities to have continued investment to upgrade the system.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Research","Okay, great. Thanks. And then, different subject, what is your appetite right now for ex-California, outside of California or unregulated type of investments? Obviously, the SolarCity moves you have made here seem to be a pullback on that front. What's your thoughts and appetites for that unregulated type of investment?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We continue to look at those opportunities. I think I've said this before, the California affiliate rules make it very difficult to start from scratch, because there is \u2013 it's very hard to take your utility expertise and without taking them away from the utility and moving into a totally separate company and they can't even talk to their colleagues back at the old business, it's hard to justify when we've got so many growth opportunities in the utility right now.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Research","Okay, great. Appreciate the thoughts.","Operator","Thank you. There are currently no additional questions waiting from the phone lines.","Janet C. Loduca - Vice President-Investor Relations","All right.

[Operator Instructions] I would like introduce your host Mr. Gabe Togneri with PG&E. Thank you, you may proceed.","Gabriel B. Togneri","Hello, everyone and thanks for joining us. Before you hear from Tony Earley, Chris Johns and Kent Harvey, I'll provide you with the usual reminder that our discussion is going to include forward-looking statements about future financial results and these are based on assumptions, expectations and information that's currently available to management. Some of the important factors that could affect the company's results are described on the second page of today's slide deck and in addition, we encourage you to review the Form 10-Q that will be filed with the SEC later today and also the discussion of risk factors that appears in the 2012 annual report. And with that, I'll hand it over to Tony.","Anthony F. Earley","Thank you, Gabe. We've got a fair amount to cover today and I'm going to start with the gas business. We continue to make progress in the field to improve the safety and reliability of our system. We've gathered an unprecedented amount of data about our Gas Transmission system and we're using our comprehensive pipeline features database to prioritize our pipeline safety work. This has resulted in some changes to the work plan and higher unit costs for work on the pipeline safety enhancement plan, as compared to the filing that we made a couple of years ago. Yesterday, we filed a required update with the CPUC that reflects these changes. As a result, we'll be taking a charge for the additional costs that won't be recovered from customers. We're disappointed to have to do this but it reflects the complexity and the challenges of this important gas safety work, and Chris will go through the details in just a couple of minutes.","A noteworthy accomplishment this quarter was the resolution of substantially all of the remaining San Bruno related third-party claims. From the beginning, our focus has been on bringing closure as quickly as possible through settlements that treat people fairly. The judge overseeing the case expressed how pleased he was that we're able to work with the plaintiffs to resolve these significant cases without going to trial and we are proud of the outcome. Also the San Mateo County District Attorney's Office has publicly indicated they will not be pursuing criminal charges under state law. However, the federal investigation under the Pipeline Safety Act is ongoing and we continue to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney's Office on that. In the regulatory area, the gas penalty proceedings are taking much longer than we had ever expected. However, the record is now complete in the 3 investigations and we await the administrative law judge's rulings. So when you lay out the timetable for the ALJ's issuing a recommended penalty and the subsequent commission decision, I think it's fair to say that the final result should be expected in the first quarter of 2014. As you know, the other parties to the proceedings have suggested unprecedented penalties. More recently, a number of third parties have weighed in calling for a more balanced approach to the penalty, recognizing that an extreme decision would have negative implications for financing California's ongoing infrastructure needs. We believe it's vital that the commission's final decision recognize the significant improvements we've made, to large sums that we have already spent without recovery from customers and that the victims have been fairly compensated in the civil proceedings.","Before I turn this over to Chris, I'll mention important progress we've made this quarter in addressing some key customer affordability issues. As many of you know, California has a multitiered residential rate structure that was intended to promote energy efficiency. Basically, higher electric consumption moves you to a significantly higher rate. Over the years, cost increases have been disproportionately loaded onto the upper tiers while the CPUC's ability to address this has been constrained by the legislature. As an unintended consequence, the structure disadvantaged a large number of our customers in areas like the Central Valley, who need air-conditioning in the hot summer months and pay extremely high bills. At the same time, customers living along the coast where there's moderate weather pay much lower bills, even those people that have fairly large houses. This year, the utilities and the consumer groups worked together on legislation that restores the CPUC authority to make important changes to fix California's rate structure. The governor signed the bill this month and we look forward to working with the CPUC to move this forward. So with that, let me turn this over to Chris.","Christopher P. Johns","Thanks, Tony, and hello, everyone. I'll begin my remarks focused on operations and then touch on the regulatory proceedings. Although we've had a lot of success in our overall operations, I'm going to focus my comments on gas ops today.","First on Slide 4, you can see the significant amount of work we've completed to make our pipeline safer just since the beginning of this year. Over the past few years, we've been testing and replacing more pipeline miles and installing more automated shutoff valves than just about any utility that I'm aware of. Much of the pipeline safety work we've been doing was based on the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan that we filed in 2011. The CPUC approved the work in December of 2012 but only gave us partial recovery of our costs. That decision also required us to update the plan once we had finished validating the Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure for all 6700 miles of our transmission pipelines. We recently completed that effort and used the result to reprioritize every pipeline segment for strength testing, which is funded with expense dollars and pipeline replacement, which is capital work. Yesterday, we filed the required Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan update application with the commission. The biggest change is to the pipeline replacement component, which is the capital side of the program. About 90 miles or roughly 1\/2 of the previously planned replacements were removed from the program and about 50 miles were added to the pipeline replacement portfolio, again based on the reprioritized risk ranking. Although there were fewer miles to replace in total, many of the miles reflected in the update are short pipeline segments, each with costs comparable to the longer segments. In addition, many of the segments included in the reprioritized and updated plan are in difficult terrain, including unstable soil and high water tables that require pumping and disposing of water, adding to the unit cost of the replacement program. Also we found more third-party infrastructure under the street than originally anticipated, such as water and sewer lines and this requires additional costs for trenching and pipe fitting. Even though we're replacing fewer miles and the cost per mile will be higher, the total costs for pipeline replacement are not substantially different from the previous plan. However, since we are replacing fewer miles, the revenues eligible for recovery under the terms of the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan are lower. Given this profile, we're required to write off the projected shortfall, which is estimated at $196 million, and we've taken that charge this quarter. We also expect a smaller impact to our strength testing plan, which is the expense component of the program. That's because we expect to do a larger amount of the work on newer pipe, which is not eligible for cost recovery. As a result, we expect additional unrecovered expenses in 2014 of about $30 million, however those charges will be taken next year as the costs are incurred. While I don't like delivering this news, I know that the result of all this work will be a safer system for our customers, and Kent will cover how this impacts our guidance in just a couple of minutes. We continue to make progress on the system-wide Centerline survey of our pipeline rights-of-way. As you can see on the slide, we've completed about 5800 miles. But we're not done yet, and we're currently working throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, our most densely populated region. The survey will still be essentially complete by the end of this year and we'll review the total cost estimate once we have clear visibility into the entire portfolio for remediation work that results. For now we're maintaining estimate of roughly $500 million over 5 years.","Turning to regulatory matters on Slide 5, the General Rate Case remains on track. We filed our reply brief and updated our overall request based on the outcome of the hearings. Everything is now in the hands of the administrative law judge and the schedule calls for a proposed decision on November 19th. On the electric transmission side last month, the FERC excepted our TO-15 filing and the rates went into effect on October 1, subject to refund based on the final outcome. We expect the case will now go through the settlement process.","As we approach the end of the year, I'll remind you that we're preparing to file our 2015 gas transmission rate case. We are already spending a lot more than is currently in revenues and in light of this increased spending, we expect the filing to be of significant size and certainly to draw attention from interveners. We plan to file the gas transmission case in the December timeframe to allow the CPUC a full year to make a decision because we don't have the same assurances about retroactivity of revenues that we've typically had in a general rate base.","We'll try to address that through the regulatory process. So with that, I'll turn it over to Kent.","Kent M. Harvey","Thank you, Chris. As usual I'm going to go through our Q3 results, as well as guidance and I'll address the impact of the PSEP capital charge that Chris discussed.","Slide 6 summarizes the results for the third quarter and earnings from operations were $0.88 per share and GAAP results were $0.36. The differences in our item impact comparability related to natural gas matters, which totaled $0.52 in the quarter. As usual that's broken out in pretax dollars in the table at the bottom of the slide. Pipeline-related expenses totaled $113 million pretax in Q3 and these include the strength testing work in our pipeline safety enhancement plan, our rights-of-way and integrity management work and then our legal costs. Next you see the $196 million pretax charge that Chris described, related to the required update to the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan. Again these are capital costs we expect to incur for pipe replacement work, which we don't expect to recover from customers. In Q3, you see there were no changes in our accrual for potential fines in connection with the gas pipeline investigations. Our accrual remains at $200 million. During the quarter, we did increase our accrual for third-party liability claims by $110 million as a result of settling virtually all remaining third-party claims in Q3. The total accrual for third-party liabilities stands at $565 million, which is within our previously established range of up to $600 million. During Q3, we also recognized $25 million of additional insurance recoveries and that brings total insurance recoveries to-date to $354 million.","Slide 7 shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations. Our lower authorized cost of capital resulted in a reduction of $0.09 compared to Q3 of last year and our increased shares outstanding resulted in a $0.04 reduction. These negative factors were partially offset by higher rate base earnings worth $0.05 compared to Q3 of last year, along with a number of smaller items. Our guidance for 2013 is on Slide 8. And at the top, you'll see the guidance earnings from operations is unchanged at $255 million to $275 per share. Some of the key assumptions underlying our guidance are provided in the appendix of the slide deck. At the bottom of the slide, you'll see our guidance for the key components of the natural gas matters in pretax dollars and we've made 3 primary changes here. First, the range for pipeline-related expenses has been adjusted downward by $50 million to reflect somewhat lower costs experienced this year. The new range is $350 million to $400 million compared to the old range of $400 million to $500 million. Second, below that you see that we've added the charge for the unrecovered PSEP capital of $196 million. Third, we've replaced the previous range for third-party liabilities with the actual amount of the accrual taken during Q3: $110 million since virtually all claims have been settled. In addition as we've done in the past, insurance recoveries have been updated to reflect the proceeds received during Q3. Regarding our equity needs, we continue to expect to target roughly $1 billion to $1.2 billion for the year, although some portion of that may be pushed into 2014. Our cumulative issuance through the end of Q3 was about $740 million and about $170 million of that was done in Q3.","I'm going to stop there and I'll turn it back to Tony for some closing remarks.","Anthony F. Earley","Thanks, Kent. Let me just summarize what we're doing to both resolve outstanding issues and to move the company forward. First, we're focused on wrapping up the uncertainty related to the gas penalty proceedings and we expect the final result in the first quarter of 2014. Second, on third-party liability claims, we're in good shape and we expect to recover a significant portion of the cost through insurance and we're going to continue to work through that process. Third, the hearings and all subsequent regulatory briefs for the General Rate Case are all completed and we're now awaiting the proposed decision in the GRC. And fourth, we're working on the gas transmission rate case that will be filed by year end. The GRC and the gas transmission cases are critical to our path forward. We made solid progress executing on our plans and we know we're laying the foundation for future success.","So with that, we'll open up the lines and answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Leslie Rich with JPMorgan.","Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.","So just in terms of thinking of the timing of the ALJ rulings, I know they're on really separate and distinct paths. But is it possible that you get an ALJ ruling on the GRC, before you get an ALJ ruling on the fines and penalties? And then in terms of the commission decision on the final decisions for both of those, are they interrelated at all or really sort of separate and distinct?","Anthony F. Earley","I'll let Tom comment in a minute, but since the record is closed and now the ALJs are working on their decisions, it really is up to the ALJ to decide how to orchestrate when they issue those decisions. And I'm not privy to what their thinking is, but they really have lots of flexibility right now. Tom, I don't know if you have any more insights.","Thomas E. Bottorff","I think that's right. On the General Rate Case, Chris mentioned schedule calls for the GRCP to come out in November, that may or may not happen but that's the current schedule. And with respect to the posed decisions [ph] on the 3 investigations, we expect those to come out in mid-December. That remains to be seen as well, but the procedural schedule would call for that kind of outcome. I don't think that the 2 decisions are being coordinated. I think they're on separate tracks. The judges do communicate with one another occasionally, but I think they're working on their own decisions and trying to get them out as quickly as possible.","Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.","And then the final decisions are sort of typically within 60 to 90 days, but not necessarily?","Thomas E. Bottorff","Yes, it could be as early as 30, that rarely happens. Yes, 60 to 90 is realistic.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman of Wolfe Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","I have a couple of questions. First on this issue of -- I guess there's kind of like a revenue per mile cap in the PSEP 1 final order, could you just explain a little better why it matters, how much cost per mile?","Christopher P. Johns","This is Chris. I'll start off and then Tom can come in on some of requirements from the regulatory process. But in general when the order was put together and the supporting work papers behind that, it identified a certain amount of work and then allowed revenues based on that certain amount and type of work that was being done. So when we've taken work out and put work back in, it basically reduced the amount of work being done and therefore, the revenues go down with that. Unfortunately, when you look at the mix of work that's remaining to be done, it is at a higher unit cost. And so it wasn't - the way it was set up was not something that allowed us a bucket of dollars to do a bucket of work. It had a cap on it based on the very specific type of work that was done and so unfortunately, the way the order works out for us is that the revenues are decreased because the amount of work is decreased. And it was indifferent as to what the cost per unit was and the types of work that we're seeing that's left to do is, as I've said in instances in different terrains and situations where the cost per unit is higher.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay.","Thomas E. Bottorff","Remember, Steve, we had also proposed contingencies that were disallowed in that case, which we didn't think was fair because of the uncertainties like this and that has hurt us.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Tony, you've talked before about -- with the right kind of GRC orders, being able to earn your allowed return, I guess, electric in '14 and gas '15. Can you say that, that's still feasible?","Anthony F. Earley","That's still our objective. I think as we've said in the past, I was pleased with the way the GRC went in. Remember, the commission had asked us to really focus on risks and safety and what we're doing, we did that. They hired independent consultants to look at both the gas business and -- the gas distribution business that's in that case and the electric business. The consultants had favorable reports and the interveners in the case really did not take issue with the safety analysis and the risk analysis. It was really just, well, we don't want rates to go up too high, and in the case, we've shown that even if we were granted the full relief, which obviously never happens but even if we were granted the full relief, the average customer bill is still below the national average. And so I'm guardedly optimistic that we will get a good result and we believe with a good result in the GRC that we certainly have an ability to earn -- or meet our objective and earning allowed return [ph]. On the second piece, Gas Transmission & Storage. That case, as Chris said, we'll file by the end of the year. Once we file it, we'll see what the reaction to it is from various interveners and get a better feel for whether it's going to be hotly contested or whether people say, yes, you really do need to spend on Gas Transmission & Storage. Because remember, a lot of new requirements that we have to cover in that case.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","And then just 1 other question to clarify the other rights-of-way issue. I mean, in the past when you've talked about the $500 million, you kind of would say that we're still kind of on track for that. I mean is that fair to say at this time, if it's still kind of -- is that estimated?","Christopher P. Johns","This is Chris, and as I said earlier, we're getting near completion. We still have just do San Francisco, which is a more congested area to go through but based on what we've seen, we're reiterating the $500 million at this time.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And then 1 last thing, can you just explain kind of what happened with this San Carlos situation and how -- how these might be handled going forward?","Christopher P. Johns","Sure, Steve. This is Chris again, and one of the things that everybody needs to recognize this obviously this is a very politically-charged environment that we're working in right now. And when you look at San Carlos, this is what we refer to as our Line #147 and we pressure tested that line in 2011 and have done the work on it that we're convinced makes it a safe line and we reiterated that to the commission and to our customers. But the issue that arose is that when we were in 2012 doing some follow up excavation on a routine leak survey and repair, we found in there that some of our records associated with that line weren't accurate. So we updated those and we did alert the CPUC and their staff to that process. And then eventually filed making sure that -- through an errata filing that folks were aware that we found that discrepancy. And quite frankly, that's part of what we want to do. As we're doing work, we want to constantly challenge and make sure that our records and the pipes are safe, and so we're going to continue to look for those kinds of things. But as we went through that, that caused the others in San Carlos to get concerned and that's where it's become a little bit more involved in the press and through the political process. But the CPUC did -- because they took issue with and had concerns about the timing of how we -- of when we notified them and the method of which we notified them, they opened these orders to show cause and both of those are proceeding now. It's hard to estimate what the outcome will be on those but we do anticipate that we will wrapped up in the next month or 2, especially on the one that we need to get them to authorize us to reenergize that line.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","FYI, I think a PD [ph] on the very question you're addressing just came out. But my question is to -- only equity delay, Kent saying that it might be pushed into 2014. Is that -- and you've obviously already also had this additional charge you've taken. Is that really just because the proceedings are taking longer and pushed into the next year, so timing for any sort of significant incremental charge is pushed out or are you doing better elsewhere? Can you just talk around your thought process there?","Anthony F. Earley","First of all, to state the obvious, which is that equity requirements is sort of the end game. There's all sorts of different things that factor into our cash needs, as well as our capital structure, essentially everything in our results factors into that. So it's kind of at the end of the line. The reality is, as in any others there are puts and takes that drive our equity needs. And the fact that we did take this charge fairly recently, in reality it isn't a huge driver for the total annual needs, because the annual needs are weighted average over the whole year and when you have a charge towards the end of the year, it doesn't have the same kind of impact as when it's reflected throughout the entire year. So puts and takes, no major changes in our expectations and in our plans, we've built in flexibility so that obviously some amounts can always spill over into the following year just because that's how the markets work and that's how the timing is and you want to have that kind of flexibility. So we're going to see how the last part of the year goes. We're generally on track but some of it may end up being in 2014. I don't think it is a concern.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just following up on this extra $200 million of cost as you've reallocated, in priority of work. Is there potential for more of these to be done as you guys reprioritize kind of the phase of work that's going to get done in '14 or '15 under the PSEP? Or is there a chance this can be reversed as you continue to do more work as what needs to get done?","Christopher P. Johns","Dan, this is Chris. We were required to file this as a onetime update on the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan. So we don't anticipate going through and reprioritizing or doing another update on this through the end of the program, which is through the end of 2014.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then I guess, just kind of, putting the cart before the horse a little bit, but as far as getting the resolution on San Bruno and potentially where the fines could end up or the penalties could end up. Can you guys just walk through kind of the legal arguments if some of these high fines or penalties are put out there. How you guys look to protest or try and reduce those impacts to shareholders from a legal perspective?","Anthony F. Earley","I'll start off, and Hyun Park, our General Counsel is here, he can add to this. But we believe that there are some very strong arguments that when a penalty gets too large, that we do have options to appeal that penalty. There are provisions under California law that prevent excessive fines and penalties, and we think that we've got some good arguments there if they just get out of line with precedents across the country and what's reasonable, given all the money that we've already spent. Hyun, I don't know if you want to add any more to that.","Hyun Park","This is Hyun Park, General Counsel. I actually think it's too early to tell. Obviously, we're speculating. But as Tony said, we believe that if the fine is so excessive, we would have both state and federal constitutional law based arguments.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And those would be appealed through California state court, U.S. federal court or a combination of any which [ph] route you decide to go.","Hyun Park","I think those are all being assessed at this point and we would have the option to go to both state, as well as federal court, we believe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kit Conlidge [ph] the line of with BGC.","Unknown Analyst","To revisit the gas transmission case a little bit again, is it going to be part of the potential reaction here that it may not be completely clear what you've been disallowed from recovering that you've already spent or plan to spend versus what the new rules require you to spend in the future. In other words, are we going to get into some very complex detailed arguments that will make it hard to figure out what the rate base is and what the return is likely to be?","Christopher P. Johns","This is Chris, and just for clarification, are you referring to the gas transmission case that we're going to file, is that what we're talking about?","Unknown Analyst","Yes.","Christopher P. Johns","So as I've said, we're spending significantly more right now, as you guys are well aware, than we're getting in revenues. And so we expect this filing to be a pretty large ask and I think it's important to remember there's a couple of differences from what we asked for the first time that got disallowed versus what we're going to ask for this time. In the last case when they did the big disallowance, there were 2 real big areas that they disallowed: One was on our records systems that we were updating and modernizing and that project will be done by the end of next year, and so that won't be part of the ask for the next time. And then that next one was, as was referred to earlier, is we asked for a large contingency because at the time, this was several years ago, we hadn't gotten through the design phase and all the engineering and the estimates were pretty rough at that time, so we put in some large contingencies and they disallowed all those contingencies. And that in this case, we got 2 years under our belts, 2.5 years under our belts knowing what these costs look like and so the contingency request would be a lot smaller. And so I think that it will be a little bit more of a standard type in terms of filings and such, other than part of the big increase is from the fact that they've changed the rules. And they've raised the standards around safety, which are good standards and that requires a lot more work from us and the other utilities and so those will be items that will be in there. We do expect that because of the size of the asset interveners, we'll get involved and they'll probably challenge us as they did on the last cases, did we already have -- did we already be get paid for these kinds of costs in the past. But we think we'll have a very solid case to be able to file and I think you'll be able to see with transparency what the rate base ask will look like. And I don't think that the issues that will be raised will be any different than things that we've seen in the past.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So just wrapping up on the gas side, quickly. You talked about filing this later this year, just to provide a little extra buffer. How much buffer do you think that provides you ultimately in terms of getting through it in a timely fashion?","Christopher P. Johns","I'll start and Tom you can -- this is Chris again. What we're trying to do is that if we do it in December that gives them, hopefully, a full 12 months' worth of time to get through the regulatory process, which is what we would hope that they would be able to do at the commission. Normally the schedules will call for something around the 12-month timeframe. So that's really what we're trying to have accomplished. I don't know -- Tom if you want to add anything?","Thomas E. Bottorff","The schedule that calls for us to file no later than February 3, so we're adding this extra couple of months just to try to make sure we get a decision by the end of the year, and we'll have that established once the commission application is filed, there will be a pre-hearing [ph] conference to set the schedule again, we hope it calls for a decision by January 1, of '15.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then going back to Dan's question and kind of juxtaposing, if you will, a potential appeals process in the context of equity needs. Can you provide just a little bit of clarity in terms of when you might need to issue equity to the extent to which a decision were to come out from the CPUC. Is there is some need to fund that immediately pending an appeal process? How do you think about that ultimately? I mean, obviously there's some balance sheet ramifications as well.","Kent M. Harvey","Julien, this is Kent. Of course any answer to that is somewhat hypothetical because it kind of depends on what the decision is, and we have a huge variety of recommendations out there and a range of possible outcomes still in these proceedings. So the specifics are going to depend on what the final decision is. If we do appeal it, unless it is an unusual situation, my guess is that from an accounting perspective, we'll still be required to accrue what the decision is because to not do that would essentially -- we'd have to think it probable that the appeal would occur and so my guess is the accounting will cause us to have to deal with some of the capital structure and financing implications, and the appeal could last a long time before that's actually resolved.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So really, the reality is you could only -- a partial amount of equity to the sense that you'd get [ph] resolution and then ultimately full payment -- ultimately would be on resolution of the appeal most likely, if it were to come to that.","Kent M. Harvey","But Julien, let's remember the scenario, and if I use one scenario, which is the SED recommendation, there's only a portion of that, that actually drives upfront equity financing. A lot of it is over time. So again it really depends on the specifics of the final PC [ph] decision.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell of Jefferies.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I want to follow up on Julien and Dan's question, talking about the appeals process. And I think that one of the responses you give Dan was, based on precedents across the country, I guess, and other pipeline matters. I mean could you highlight or give us some examples or yard markers of where previous appeals, or I guess pipeline penalties have been?","Anthony F. Earley","As far as we can determine, the largest penalty in a -- pipeline gas pipeline explosion incident related to El Paso natural gas about -- a little over a decade ago, it was just over $100 million in penalties. Now there have been some more recently, there was one in Pennsylvania that was in the low double digits. Nick, do you remember that number?","About $25 million. Some of that was constrained by some of the state law in Pennsylvania. But if you look at all of it, and we've done this work -- the numbers that are being talked about, which would total $4 billion in penalties are orders of magnitude beyond anything that's ever been assessed. And when you think about it, assessing a penalty that size doesn't accomplish anything. We made major changes in the leadership in the organization here, we immediately started to do work, knowing that we weren't going to recover, but we didn't wait until we had an order telling us what we'd recover and what we didn't. We went and did the right thing, and so we think it accomplishes any logical purpose to have penalties the size that some of the folks are talking about.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So just a follow-up, if I think about it, a decision comes out we hope in the first quarter of '14 and let's just say the decision comes out that's on top of the SED recommendation and the company does appeal it and I guess, there's really no timeline for an appeal. If an appeal brings a decision back to something closer to like an El Paso decision, does the utility now go refile with the commission to recoup the difference or start recovering what was disallowed previously?","Anthony F. Earley","Yes, it's too early to speculate what we do in that case but clearly, if we get a decision that's near where some of the proponents are advocating, we'll start the appeal process and work that through.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Question on the General Rate Case. Tony, you commented that you've got a little bit of positive outlook, or have gotten some positive feedback on the rate case filings. But if I go back and actually look at the testimony, there's a pretty big spread between your request and what some of the main intervenors had requested in terms of a revenue requirement. I'm just curious, is there a bogey or a level where if you get a certain amount in the rate increase, it wouldn't impact what you would wind up spending on the system, whether in OpEx or in capital spending levels, meaning -- are you in a position where if you get an outcome that isn't what you're looking for, that you're willing to dial back spending on the system?","Anthony F. Earley","Well, we think everything that we've asked for is justifiable. We did a lot of work around the risk associated with not doing the work. I think the issue as I said before, you never get 100% so at some point whatever the number is you have to take a look at -- are there discretionary things that you take out of your spending, or are there some important things that, instead of a having a 5-year plan to do a particular program, do it in 7 years or 8 years or something like that. So I think there will be flexibility. We'll have to work hard, but I think we made a really good showing that a lot of this, and particularly on the gas side of the business, are things that we ought to get on with.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and how much when you think about the rate increase request, how much is capital driven versus how much is growth in O&M?","Anthony F. Earley","Let me ask. Tom, do you have those numbers handy?","Thomas E. Bottorff","No, we don't have those numbers available, but we can certainly share them with you later.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And apologies, just kind of focusing on the rate case because I know there's been so much attention on the San Bruno related dockets but I mean, the revenue request of over $1 billion is a big number in the grand scheme of things and some of the intervenors came out with dramatic differences versus your forecast.","Anthony F. Earley","They did, but to get back to my point early, when you look at it -- it's a big company with total revenues in the high teens. The average bill, if we get 100% of what we've asked for, is still below the national average. And I think that's what customers really care about. I mean, it's always a discussion about why your rate is high, but in many parts of our service territory the total bill is low because of usage and that's why the legislation we got that allows restructuring the rates is so important because this skewing where the high-end of our structure was way high. We'll be able to make a significant dent in that high-end. Our current high rate is about $0.35. That will come down significantly if we just use the normal cost of service regulation that many other states, probably almost all states use.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","I'm looking at the calendar here. So we're waiting for a decision on the penalty -- or a proposed position on the penalty. Then you will file a transmission -- gas transmission rate case where you can ask for a pretty significant increase as you're suggesting. We have a pending electric rate case. So how is it possible that you could actually challenge the decision by the commission while you have 2 big rate cases pending? I'm asking about legal challenges to a proposed penalty decision or a final penalty decision.","Anthony F. Earley","Well, there certainly is no legal barrier to doing that. I mean these are all --","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","I'm talking about the collateral damage to those other proceedings from such a filing.","Anthony F. Earley","Right, and remember -- I mean, so our Gas Transmission & Storage case while we'll file it, it will go through a year-long process. So you're going to have a significant amount of time pass between when we file the case and when it actually gets decided, and lots of hearings and a recommended decision there. So I mean I'm comfortable that in the interest of protecting our shareholder's interest, we'll have to make the right decision on the penalty phase. And if the penalty phase is too big, we're comfortable with going ahead and appealing that. And we've seen that the commission seems to have been able to separate the San Bruno proceeding from our normal regulatory process. I know early on, there was a lot of concern about, was there going to be some slop over and would San Bruno affect other regulatory proceedings, and we continue to believe that there isn't any evidence of that.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Okay, and separately, so you were planning to issue between $1 billion and $1.2 billion of equity this year. And we are almost in November and you've issued $740 million. Is it that you need less for this year and thus, you're not rushing to issue the additional equity? Or are you basically waiting for the final proposed penalty decision?","Kent M. Harvey","Angie, this is Kent. We have had $1 billion, $1.2 billion as our target for the year. I indicated on an earlier question that we do have some flexibility. So if it's appropriate and we're going to sort of assess things over the remaining months, if it's appropriate, some might push into next year. But we haven't had any major change in our overall needs for equity.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium Asset Management.","Ashar Khan","Ken, I was just trying to look at this Slide 8, where you have the natural gas matters and the expenses tied to them. The pipeline-related expenses to the low end of the guidance is $450 million and the high guidance range I guess, is $350 million. And if I'm right, you spent total 9 months something like, $250 million. So can you give us a sense where you are going to end up over here because it's still, I guess, the range is still wide enough with still 1 quarter left and I guess now only 2 months left as the year is coming to a close.","Kent M. Harvey","We're keeping the range at -- we've adjusted the range to $350 million to $450 million. That range used to be at $400 million to $500 million and that's the adjustment we made on the call.","Ashar Khan","So we could still -- why is it back-end loaded, can I ask? That's what I'm trying to understand.","Kent M. Harvey","Let me just recap what's included in that. There's 3 major components. There is our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan expense work, which is for the strength testing and that is seasonal work, and we didn't have a lot of that very early in the year so it tends to be certainly in the third quarter, and some of it in the fourth quarter as well. The second component of that is our rights-of-way work as well as our integrity management work, and Chris gave an update on the rights-of-way work. We're not done with that yet and that will continue into the fourth quarter. And then the last category is sort of our legal and other costs, and that also is obviously driven by the things you think would drive that. Those are really the factors and our guidance is $350 million to $450 million.","Ashar Khan","Can you give us some approximation, percentage wise, the 3 factors that you mentioned how much they make up of this total?","Thomas E. Bottorff","There is a slide in the appendix that gives ranges for each of the components. So I'll refer you to that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with MorningStar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","One, in terms of the trend -- the electric transmission stuff, the TO. I wonder if you can characterize the key issues in those settlement discussions right now, both in the TO14, TO15.","Thomas E. Bottorff","This is Tom Bottorff. You may be aware, the TO14 has been settled, we reached a tentative agreement with all the parties and we filed that settlement agreement with FERC yesterday. So that's pending. We expect the judge to certify it, make a recommendation to the full [ph] commission to improve it and probably expect a final decision in first quarter of next year. So all the issues in that case were settled. The key issues tend to be around the rate of return, that's been one, not just in our proceedings, but nationally. And the amount of investment is also an issue; the depreciation rate sometimes is an issue; operating and maintenance costs compared to historical trends tend to be an issue. So they tend to be fairly consistent from proceeding to proceeding and I'm sure we'll address those again in TO15, which is pending.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And then on TO15 with that possible increase in the ROE, what kind of earnings impact could that have, given the rates went into effect October 1. So you have essentially 3 months versus what -- I believe you said in the guidance was about a 9.1% full year.","Kent M. Harvey","Yes, this is Kent. It is in effect for 3 months. I'll just say we booked the revenues that we request, but we also reserve against those revenues for a litigation assessment until the case is resolved. So it's really the net of those that affect our overall results. I would say compared to the 9.1%, we're hopeful there we're going to end up doing better so it's probably a slight favorable this year but in reality, not in place for very long during 2013.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Anthony F. Earley","I take it that there are no further questions?","Operator","We have one question from Kamal Patel with Wells Fargo.","Kamal B.

Johns","Monique, did we lose him?","Operator","[Operator Instructions] .","[Technical Difficulty]","Kamal B. Patel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","What risks do you see in your pending -- or your upcoming gas transmission rate case with the potential shuffling of leadership at the CPUC late next year, early 2015?","Thomas E. Bottorff","This is Tom Bottorff. I don't think the shuffling of the commissioners puts the case at risk at this point. It depends on the arguments that are presented by both sides and what the judge ultimately considers to be a reasonable outcome after hearing the case. If the decision -- if the PD is out prior to the end of the year and the commissioners who are seated today get a chance to vote on it, there's no change. But you're correct, if the decision is beyond January 15th we could have 2 new commissioners and it's unclear what perspectives they will bring to the commission at this point.","Kamal B. Patel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Second question being, one of the key focus areas for the management team has been to partner effectively and rebuild relationships. And wondering where you think you stand in light of, Tony, I think you've been there about 2 years, in light of comments that were made back in August regarding concerns surrounding a bankruptcy and the recent San Carlos issues. Do you think those have had detrimental impact on rebuilding those relationships?","Anthony F. Earley","Well, obviously, this is politically charged and the articles in the press can affect that, but we continue to see improvement in our customer satisfaction numbers. Last quarter, we saw yet another increase. And the other indicator, I think, over the past, probably 2 months, we've had 1 to 2 dozen editorials and op-ed pieces from community leaders, mayors, business associations supporting the notion that while PG&E ought to be penalized for San Bruno, that the numbers that are now being talked about are counterproductive, that the company is an effective and an important member of communities across large portions of the state. And if you read those things, it's very encouraging that our message has gotten out and our efforts to, as we call it, go local and really partner with local communities have been very effective.","Kamal B.

You may proceed.","Janet Loduca","Thank you, [Monique], and thanks to those of you on the phone for joining us. Before I turn it over to Tony Earley, I want to remind you that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements about our outlooks for future financial results which are based on assumptions, forecasts, expectations and information currently available to management.","Some of the important factors that could affect the Company\u2019s actual financial results are described on the second page of today\u2019s third quarter earnings and business update presentations. We also encourage you to review our quarterly report on form 10-Q that will be filed with the SEC later today and the discussion of risk factors that appears there and in the 2015 annual report.","With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Tony.","Tony Earley","Well, thank you, Janet. And thanks all of you for joining us. We're going to do something little different on today's call. We've resolved number of regulatory and legal issues over the last several months.","With the gas transmission and storage rate case decision, the all party general rate case settlement and the resolution of the most of the San Bruno related proceedings we want to step back and review where we are and where we're heading.","We plan to spend about half a time on today call with our prepared remarks. I'll start with the quick overview of our third quarter results and then share our vision for where the company is headed. We're also initiating 2017 earnings guidance today.","So our presentation will take a little longer than usual, but we still expect to have about 30 minutes for questions at the end.","So with that, let me turn it over to Jason to cover the third quarter results and then I'll talk more about or longer term vision.","Jason Wells","Thank you, Tony, and good morning everyone. I'm going to just start with the third quarter earnings presentation that we issued this morning and then we'll move to the business update presentation.","Slide three shows our results for the third quarter. Earnings from operations came at $0.94. I know this is lower than many of you expected, but we are reaffirming our guidance from earnings from operations for the full year.","As I'll discuss more in a minute, the Q3 results are largely driven by timing items. Our third quarter GAAP earnings including the items impacting comparability were also shown on slide three.","Pipeline related expenses were $31 million pretax this quarter. The charge for legal and regulatory related expenses was $23 of pretax, and fines and penalties were $67 million pretax are primarily related to the San Bruno penalty decision.","We're showing $60 million pretax for the Butte fire-related, net of insurance which are largely for legal costs associated with the butte fire. We did not adjust our insurance receivable this third quarter.","However, we do intent to seek recovery of all insured losses from our insurance carriers. And as a reminder, the current receivable should not be viewed as a ceiling on insurance recoveries.","Moving to slide four, you'll see our quarter-over-quarter comparison of earnings from operations of $0.84 in Q3 of last year to $0.94 in Q3 of this year. As a result of the Phase 1 gas transmission storage rate case decision we increased our rates in August to begin recovering the higher approved revenues. This resulted in a $0.11 of higher revenues compared to Q3 of last year.","We also continue to see $0.05 positive for growth and rate concerns, and regulatory and legal matters total$0.05 positive for the quarter. This item include some incentive revenue awards","Timing of taxes was $0.04 negative for the quarter and as a reminder this is purely a timing item that will net to zero by year end. As a result you can expect to see a $0.20 pickup in the fourth quarter of fully offset the amount recognized through Q3. We also had $0.03 negative for an increased in outstanding shares and $0.04 negative for number of miscellaneous items. ","Turning to slide five. We are reaffirming our guidance from earnings from operations of $3.65 to $3.85 per share. GAAP guidance is shown here as well. We are also reaffirming our expectation of roughly 800 million in equity issuance this year.","Slide six shows our updated guidance assumptions. We assume capital expenditures of roughly $5.7 billion which is slightly higher than our second quarter projection of 5.6 billion.","We've increase the gas distribution number to reflect our best estimate of spend through the end of the year. Our assumption for weighted average rate base is $32.4 billion consistent with last quarter.","At in the bottom right we've updated the other factors effecting earnings from operations to reflect the proposed Phase 2 decision we received earlier this week in the gas transmission rate case.","Our guidance assumes that the proposed decision is approved this year without any material modifications. If we do not receive a final Phase 2 decision before the end of the year our earnings will be reduced by about $0.25.","And we continue to target earning, our 10.4% CPUC authorized return on equity across the enterprise plus the net impact of the other earnings factors listed here.","Moving to slide seven, we've updated the ranges for several of the 2016 items impacting comparability. The range for pipeline related expenses is the same as last quarter. For legal and regulatory related expenses we've updated this slide to reflect our expectation that will come in at about $75 million which is the high end of the previous range.","Fines and penalties increased by $50 million pretax reflecting a number of updates which I'll cover in a minute. We've also updated the butte fire related costs reflect a charge of $60 million pretax in Q3 largely driven by legal costs.","We remained unable to estimate the high end of the range at this time. The remaining items are unchanged from last quarter. The table at the bottom of the page is our updates to fines and penalties.","First the charge for disallowed capital has increased by $6 million. We have now fully accrued for all of these safety related capital we've expect to be disallowed in the Phase 2 gas transmission decision.","Second, we incurred $4 million charge for the ex parte penalty associated with the higher gas transmission revenues we collected in August and September. Assuming the proposed Phase 2 decision has approved this year we will record an additional 54 million in Q4 to reflect the full 2016 impact of the ex parte penalty.","Third, we increase the gas distribution record keeping fine by 2 million to reflect the modified presiding officer's decision. The total is now $26 million. And finally, we've included a $3 million charges as a result of federal criminal verdict.","So that's concludes Q3 earnings update. We continue to have confidence and our ability to achieve our guidance this year assuming the proposed Phase 2 decision in the gas transmission rate case is approved in December.","With a resolution of a number of significant issues over the last several months we have much greater clarity in our future operational and financial performance which we've laid out in the business update.","So with that, let me turn it back over to Tony.","Tony Earley","Thanks, Jason. Let me turn to the business update presentation that we issued earlier this morning. I'd encourage all of you to have the presentation in front of you as I share my comments because I think it will be a little easier to follow on.","As you can see on slide three, we're going to cover three areas today. First, I'm going to review the progress we've made over the last six years because we have come a long way. We know we still have more work to do but I am really proud of what the team has accomplished and I want to share some of those results with you.","Second, I'm going to talk about some of the things that really provide PG&A with a strategic advantage, and third I'm going to talk about what's driving growth going forward. As part of that Jason is going to review the 2017 earnings guidance as well as our updated CapEx at rate base guidance through 2019.","Between our 6.5% to 7% rate base growth and our above average dividend per share growth we expect to deliver strong returns over the next several years. So let me start with the progress that we made.","Slide five provides the high level overview of the company. As you can see over 90% of our revenues are set by the California Public Utilities Commission with the remainder set by FERC and nearly half of our revenues are pass through for things like energy procurement costs and public purpose programs.","Turning to slides six, one of things I'm most proud of is how we've embedded safety into our core governance structures. Safety is really the foundation of everything that we do.","When I join the company in 2011 we began a back to basic structure with safety at the forefront. Let me give you some examples of that. At the leadership level we've supplemented our team with new board members and executives who bring significant utility experience.","At the Boards of Directors we brought on a number of former utility CEOs like Anne Shen Smith from Southern Cal Gas. Rich Kelly from Xcel Energy and Fred Fowler from Spectra Energy, and we brought in a whole new leadership team on the gas side of the business starting with Nick Stavropoulos who brings more than 35 years of experience in the gas industry.","We've included bios for some of our leadership team in the appendix. In 2012 we became the first utility in the industry to publish a dashboard to track how we're performing on key public safety metrics such as emergency response times and reduction of gas dig-ins and electric wire downs.","And that focus is driven significant operational improvements as I'll discuss in just a minute. Several years ago we also restructured our short term variable compensation plan so that 50% is now tied to our performance on public and employee safety. This incentive program applies to all of our management employees as well as some of our union representative employees.","And finally we've done a lot of work on our safety culture. This is probably the most critical piece because it's our culture that ultimately drives the performance that we're looking for.","Part of our strategy has been to install continuous improvement mindset by encouraging employees to identify gaps and opportunities and then close them to benchmarking and process improvement.","We also wanted to make sure that every employee felt comfortable raising concerns no matters how big or small. So we made a number of changes to encourage all employees to speak up when something doesn't seem right. ","For example, we work with our unions to develop a non-punitive self-reporting policy. We've also adapted the nuclear industry's corrective action program across the company to make it easy for employees to report things that need to be fixed.","In fact employees can now report corrective action items through a simple app on their smart devices. And we've created a number of awards to publicly recognized employees when they do speak up so that we're encouraging and reinforcing that behavior. All of these efforts have really paid off. ","As you can see on slide seven, we've achieve industry leading performance on a number of gas safety metrics. We've reduced our emergency response time and gas dig-ins by about 40%.","And we've virtually eliminated our leak backlog by completely redesigning our approach to finding and repairing leaks, including deploying sophisticated new technologies that are thousand times more sensitive than traditional detection equipment.","We've replaced to upgrade 100s of miles of distribution and transmission pipeline. We're the first utility in the country to be certify under PAS 55, ISO 55001, and RC 14001 for asset management programs.","And we're the first company in the U.S. to meet the rigor of the American petroleum institute 1173 standard for pipeline safety and safety culture. So I couldn't be more proud of how the team has turned the gas business around.","We've also made tremendous improvements on the electric side of the business. As you can see on slide eight, our emergency response performance is now in the first quartile and as a result of our investments in smart meters, automatic switches and circuit upgrades we've delivered seven straight years of record breaking electric reliability.","Our customers are experiencing fewer and shorter outages than ever before. All of these improvements are really showing up in our customer satisfactions scores, while we still have more work to do, our JD Power results across all customer classes have increased steadily since 2012 as you can see on slide nine.","The improvement we made in safety and reliability over the last six years have put us in a position to deliver strong financial results going forward. Earlier this year we announced our first dividend increase in six years and we've committed to achieving roughly payout ratio by 2019. Combined with our expected rate base growth we're confident we can deliver a strong overall return for our shareholders.","Turning to section, I want to highlight a few areas that provide PG&A with the strategic advantage particular as our industry undergoes significant change. One of the trends we've seen over the last decade is the increasing focus on climate change and greenhouse gas reduction and that trend is only going to intensify in coming years.","At PG&E we've been committed to sustainability for decades and we're one of the greenest utilities in the country. As you can see on slide 13 nearly 60% of our electric deliveries come from carbon free and renewable resources, that's almost [Indiscernible] average, and that's important to our customers who pride themselves on environmental stewardship.","PG&E's customers are leading the way for the country with 25% of all rooftop solar installations and 20% of all electric vehicles. We've also expanded our engagement efforts establishing Advisory Council last year to help inform our sustainability strategy and priorities.","Discounts was made up of a diverse group of leaders from environmental organization like Ceres and the National Resource and Defense Council, as well as policy experts academia and businesses, and we consistently been recognized as one of the leading companies by a number of third party sustainability assessments. We've also had the privilege of operating in a state that has a number constructive regulatory mechanism which is shown on slide 14.","In California revenues have been decoupled from sales for decades to a help encourage energy efficiencies, so PG&E's revenues are not impacted by changes and load.","The CPUC has also authorized a number of balancing accounts that allows us to track and recover costs that are more unpredictable such as a cost to respond earthquakes and other large scale emergency.","Our rate cases are based on forward looking test years, and the CPUC is now reviewing all requests through the lens of risk mitigation. We think this is that right approach and aligns well with our strategic planning process which starts with a detailed risk assessment of all of our assets.","In fact earlier this year the CPUC safety and enforcement division found PG&E's risk management process to be industry leading. California also has a separate cost of capital proceeding that establishes the authorize capital structure and return on equity over three-year period for all of the IOUs. Our current 10.4% return on equity is fixed through 2017.","Turning to slide 15. California continues to be a leader on energy policy. The state is now targeting to reduced greenhouse gas emissions to at least 40% below [1990] levels by 2030. To get there California will be increasing renewables to 50% doubling energy efficiency and electrifying the transportation sector. And PG&E will continue to be a critical partner in helping the state to achieve its energy policy goals.","So that brings me to our last differentiator. California's policy goals around safety and environmental leadership will continue to provide opportunities for sustained infrastructure investment.","To support safety and reliability PG&E is investing in multiyear programs to enhance our gas, electric and generation assets, and I'll provide some specific examples in just a minute.","To enable California's clean energy economy PG&E will continue to modernize the grid to ensure our systems \u2013 ensure that our systems can effectively integrate both the increased renewables and distribute energy resources.","Longer term California is working on some of the largest rail and water infrastructure projects in the country which we expect will require hundreds of millions in PG&E investments over the next 15 years.","With our proven track record of being able to finance and deliver on these types of large scale projects we are well-positioned to help the state achieve all of its goals at a reasonable cost.","This brings me to our last section which focuses on our future growth profile. As you can see on slide 18, we have three focus areas; continuing to enhance safety and reliability, enabling California's clean energy economy, and ensuring that our customer's rates will continue to be affordable particularly in light of future load projections.","Slide 19 shows a few examples to some of the longer term programs will be executing to enhance safety and reliability. On the gas side of the business, we've been steadily increasing the percentage of our gas transmission pipeline that is capable of inline inspection and we're targeting to reach about 65% by 2026.","In fact we partnered with a number of companies to create the next generation of inline inspection tools that can capture even more detailed information about the integrity of the pipeline without any interruption to gas service.","We also continue to increase the number of miles of gas distribution pipeline we're replacing each year. On the electric side by 2019 we're targeting to install automated switch on about 45% of our urban distribution lines and upgrade about 85% of our urban substations.","These investments will continue to enhance electric reliability by increasing our ability to automatically reroute power during outages. California's clean energy policies will also drive continued investment.","As you can see on slide 20, we expect to spend about $1 billion through 2020 on grid modernization projects. As I mentioned earlier our customers are already adaptors of technology and we already have the most solar rooftop installations and electric vehicles in the country.","The demands on distribution grid are greater than ever before and we need to continue to invest in technologies and systems that seamlessly integrate distributed energy resources and accommodate two-way power flow.","We also expect to play a critical role and helping to electrify the transportation sector by building out the necessary charging infrastructure. And we see this trend continuing well into the next decade as the states moves towards its longer term goals of increased renewables, energy efficiency, energy storage and electric vehicles.","With all of this investment in our future, we are keenly focused on affordability. As you can see on slide 21, we are in good shape today. Our bills are 30% lower than the national average. And over the last couple of decades, our electric rates have grown in line with the rate of inflation. But we know it will be challenging to continue this trend.","Over the next 10 to 15 years, we expect our bundled electric load to decline due to a combination of increased energy efficiency and demand response, and communities electing to procure their own generation through community choice aggregation. In fact this was a major driver behind our decision not to seek to extend the Diablo Canyon Power Plant license beyond the current expiration dates of 2024 and 2025. As you can see on slide 22, we have a number of strategies to manage this change.","Our current electric portfolio gives us a lot of flexibility. We purchased over half of our energy from third-parties and about 30% of the megawatt hours under contract are expiring over the next five years. As I mentioned earlier, our revenues have been decoupled from sales for decades and we have mechanisms in place to allocate appropriate costs to our departing customers.","So, while declining load doesn't impact our earnings, it does ship costs among our customers under the current rate structures. That\u2019s why our strategy also includes modernizing our rate structures. As the use of our grid changes, the way our rates are designed needs to be changed as well. Both the State Legislature and the Public Utilities Commission have recognized the need for reform and we\u2019ve made some progress over the last year through flattening the residential tiers and moving new net energy metering customers to time of use rates.","We\u2019ve also shifted the peak period for our time of use rates from mid-day to the evening hours in recognition of the significant amount of solar generation now available during the day but more work needs to be done. In September, the CPUC issued a draft whitepaper on its Distributed Energy Resources Action Plan, which outlined its vision for effectively integrating Distributed Energy Resources into the system.","Part of that vision is to develop rates structure for the new grid uses, while ensuring that rates remain affordable for non-DER customers. We look forward to working with the commission over the next several years to update our rate structures, to better reflect the current and future uses of the grid.","At the same time, we are working to drive sustainable efficiencies in our own cost structure. To our benchmarking and continuous improvement efforts, we have successfully reduced costs in a number of areas over the last few years.","Going forward, we will continue to capture savings through process improvement, technology investment and procurement efficiencies while maintaining a strong focus on safety and reliability. So, as I think you can see, we are at the forefront of a lot of exciting industry changes. California\u2019s vision of a decarbonized economy creates a lot of investment opportunities.","As we just discussed, we are well-positioned to manage changes to our load profile as customer choice increases. So before I turn it back over to Jason to talk about our updated guidance, I want to say again how proud I\u2019m of the progress that this team has made over the last six years.","We\u2019ve had a relentless focus on safety and reliability and you can really see the results of that in our operational metrics. I\u2019m excited about our future and confident in our ability to deliver strong operational and financial results going forward.","So with that, let me turn it back over to Jason.","Jason Wells","Thank you, Tony. I\u2019m going to finish up today\u2019s presentation by reviewing our 2017 earnings guidance and updated CapEx and rate base guidance through 2019.","Turning to slide 25, our 2017 guidance on an earnings from operations basis is $3.55 to $3.75 per share. We are also providing ranges for the items impacting comparability, which I will come back to in a minute after we review the guidance assumptions on slide 26.","Starting the upper left corner, you will see we are assuming capital expenditures of roughly $6 billion. We\u2019ve included the breakdown by rate case here. In the upper right corner, our estimate weighted average rate base is about $34.3 billion for the year. Both the CapEx and rate base assumptions are within the ranges as we provided last quarter.","In the lower left, we continue to assume a CPUC authorized equity ratio of 52% and a return on equity of 10.4%. Finally in the bottom right corner, we list some of the other factors we believe will affect 2017 earnings from operations.","Our guidance assumes that both the GRC settlement and a proposed Phase 2 decision in the gas transmission rate case are approved without material change. And you will recall that we do not seek recovery in the gas transmission rate case for about $50 million of costs in 2017.","We are also showing a positive item here for incentive revenues and other benefits, which include things like our energy efficiency programs. I will note that we are no longer showing a positive item for tax benefits, consistent with the guidance we previously provided. And we continue to expect that CWIP earnings will be offset by below-the-line costs, which includes things like charitable contributions, advertising and certain environmental costs.","In 2017, we expect that a number of other -- we expect that the other earnings factors listed here will largely offset each other. As a result, we are targeting to earn the CPUC authorized return on equity on rate base for the enterprise as a whole.","Turning to slide 27. The guidance for our items impacting comparability ranges from a negative $35 million to a positive $40 million pre-tax. The categories are consistent with the items we had in 2016. The estimated range for pipeline related expenses is $80 million to a $125 million pre-tax.","This item relates to clearing our gas transmission rights-of-way. While we are confident in our ability to fully complete the program within this range, there is a chance that a small portion of that work could slip to 2018 due to permitting requirements. We will monitor the program throughout the year and provide updates as we have better information.","The second component is legal and regulatory related expenses, which we estimate to be between $10 million and $40 million pre-tax. This represents costs incurred with enforcement, regulatory and litigation activities regarding natural gas matters and regulatory communications.","The third component is for potential fines and penalties, again related to natural gas matters and regulatory communications. We are showing a total of $30 million, which reflects a 2017 portion of the disallowed expenses expected from the Phase 2 gas transmission rate case decision. While we haven\u2019t yet reflected the 2017 portion of the ex-parte penalty, we would expect to report an additional $40 million pre-tax after the proposed Phase 2 decision is approved.","Butte fire related costs are uncertain in 2017. But this item will reflect any updates to third-party liability estimates, legal costs and insurance receivables. And finally for the gas transmission rate case, we are showing a positive $160 million for the portion of the 2015 and 2016 out-of-period revenues that we plan to recognize in 2017.","Turning to slide 28. We assume equity issuance of about $400 million to $600 million in 2017. That compares to roughly $800 million in 2016. The main drivers for the difference are the lower expected San Bruno penalty costs and gas transmission capital disallowance. Partially offsetting these reductions are higher capital expenditures.","After 2017, we expect our unrecovered costs to continue to decline as we wrap up the gas transmission rights-of-way program. As a result in 2018 and 2019, we expect to be able to meet our equity needs largely through our internal programs, which can generate about $350 million annually.","Moving to slide 29 and 30. We\u2019ve updated our CapEx and rate base guidance through 2019. This year, we are including a breakdown by major rate case. For the general rate case, the numbers are consistent with the all-party settlement we announced earlier this year.","For the gas transmission and storage rate case, the numbers are consistent with the assumptions embedded in our Q2 guidance with one exception. We previously assumed that roughly $400 million would be added to rate base in 2017 for the 2011 through 2014 capital spend subject to audit. Because that audit has not yet begun, we are now assuming that the $400 million will be added to rate base in 2018.","For the electric transmission owner rate case, we show a small range, which represent the TO18 request at the high end and a TO17 settlement at the low end. We\u2019ve held these assumptions flat through 2019. We\u2019ve also listed some items here that are not included in our rate base assumptions, including primarily any new investments that will be included in the 2019 gas transmission rate case and the 2018, 2019 electric transmission rate cases.","Finally, slide 31 is just a reminder that we are targeting a roughly 60% payout ratio for our dividend by 2019. On average, this should provide for above average dividend per share growth. I know we\u2019ve covered a lot this morning.","Let me conclude by reiterating the points Tony started with. Over the last six years, our focus on safety has resulted in significant operational improvements. We have a number of strategic advantages that help position us to effectively manage industry changes and we believe our roughly 6.5% to 7% rate base growth and above average dividend per share growth through 2019 make us an attractive investment.","With that, I will open it up for questions in the time we have remaining.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. You may proceed, Mr. Fleishman.","Steve Fleishman","Hi. Good morning. So, just on the financing plan for 2017 and the equity, is this -- are we pretty much at a level where we are just funding the core business, or we are not really dealing with any of the kind of balance sheet fixes for some of the lingering issues?","Jason Wells","Hey. Good morning, Steve. The 2017 equity guidance plan does assume that we continue to fund some unrecovered costs, which are primarily related to the clearance of our rights-of-way, our gas transmission business. Otherwise the major driver of the equity plan is our CapEx and the needs of our CapEx spending.","Steve Fleishman","And how much -- is that a $100 million still or is that a different rights-of-way for $75million? ","Jason Wells","We are estimating between $80 million to $125 million for the year.","Steve Fleishman","Okay.","Jason Wells","Pre-tax.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then one other high-level question. Tony, you mentioned in terms of the affordability stuff, you have a lot of your old PPA contract rolling off over the next five years?","Tony Earley","That\u2019s correct.","Steve Fleishman","My recollection is some of these probably are pretty high pricing. So, I\u2019m just curious how much potential rate headroom that creates over the long-term or any kind of just sense of that?","Tony Earley","Yes. Steve, the way to look at is -- our objective is to maintain a rate trajectory to approximate the rate of inflation and you\u2019ve got several levers to pull. One is we are working hard on efficiencies within our operations. But as you recognized, another will be the cost of purchase power. And you are absolutely right. Some of the early renewable contracts that we signed probably decade ago were significantly higher and while those aren\u2019t changes that fall to the bottom line as such but they are changes that affect affordability because they directly affect the customer bill.","So, we are working on pulling those levers. And then we have a number of other balancing accounts. So, we continue to work on where again, don\u2019t necessarily fall to the bottom line but give us more headroom when we invest the capital that we see we are going to be investing over the next decade or so.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Fleishman. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Smith with UBS. You may proceed.","Julien Smith","Hi. Two questions here. First, little bit more detailed, when you think about the cost of capital proceeding coming up, can you give us some comments on what the tailwinds you are seeing in your cost of debt versus what\u2019s embedded in rates today and willingness to potentially use that as something as part of the ongoing conversations? I will stop there.","Tony Earley","Cost of capital or any settlement discussions are confidential. But what I would say in terms of the embedded benefit for cost of that is roughly around $75 million a year.","Julien Smith","Got it. And that\u2019s pretty stable right now.","Tony Earley","That\u2019s kind of what we are currently experiencing. Now, I will have to see what rates, how rates move and what our upcoming issuances look like.","Julien Smith","Got it. Excellent. And then going back a little bit higher level, you commented one of the erosions in your sales forecast relates to CCAs. Can you comment on what the pace of the CCA is and just broadly what that means for your business? I know there is puts and takes but I\u2019d just be curious, specifically on the procurement front, what does that mean?","Tony Earley","Geisha Williams will comment on that.","Geisha Williams","Hi, Julien. This is Geisha. So, we have CCA activity going on at various stages of development or at various stages of considerations. Some of the CCAs, some of the communities present larger amounts of loads than others and so it\u2019s really a probabilistic view of trying to figure out when certain CCAs are going to happen, what kind of load might affect the partner.","Now, remember that they would only be responsible for providing the energy, the energy side of the business. We would still be responsible for the T&D business. So, as we look at our load projections, it is kind of difficult to pinpoint it down to a particular number in terms of what we might be able to see from CCAs. It can move pretty quickly. And in other cases we see CCA is taking longer, sometimes up to 18 months or 24 months. So it\u2019s a bit fluid is how I would answer that.","Julien Smith","Got it. Maybe just curious, do you think broadly the tariff structure, the exits and ongoing payments are sort of reflective of what the incurred costs?","Steve Malnight","Hey, Julien. This is Steve Malnight from Regulatory Affairs. As we look back, we are constantly working with the commission on how to continue to revisit and look at the cost allocation mechanisms that are in place. I will say as Geisha alluded to, I think when we look forward, we see a significant expansion of CCA load growth and that\u2019s one of the reasons why the Diablo Canyon settlement made sense for us. So in light of that, we continue to go back and look. And I think that it\u2019s likely that those mechanisms will evolve as the marketplace evolves as well.","Julien Smith","Got it. Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Smith. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.","Jonathan Arnold","Good morning, guys.","Tony Earley","Good morning, Jon.","Jason Wells","Hi, Jon.","Jonathan Arnold","Thanks for all the details. Just a quick question. You indicated that the items kind of other than regular rate base type of math would amount to about zero in 2017. Any reason to see that changing, as you look out into \u201818 and \u201819 that\u2019s obvious?","Tony Earley","It continues to remain our objective to earn our authorized return on equity. What I will say is the gas transmission and storage Phase 1 decision created some challenges for us in terms of mandated work levels and certain cost gaps. However, we are going to continue to drive efficiencies to offset these challenges to enable us to earn our authorized return. So, I think that should be focus, earning the authorized return on equity across the enterprise as a whole.","Jonathan Arnold","And then just sort of a little detailed. I think you said that going forward \u201818, \u201919, you think you could hit your equity needs largely through internal plans and that they generate about 350 a year. Should we be using 350, is it little higher or?","Tony Earley","I was going to stick with what I had said, which was it will largely meet our equity needs.","Jonathan Arnold","Thanks. All right. That\u2019s it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Arnold. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.","Michael Lapides","Hey guys. Congrats. Tony, one question, the slide on grid modernization and the $1 billion spend, just curios is all of that embedded in some of the GRC settlement in your distribution spend that you have over the next few years, or we have to go into the CPUC and request approval of this in some kind of memo account?","Tony Earley","The approach we\u2019re making is to embed our grid modernization in our GRC cases, in our transmission system cases. So, we\u2019ve been making these investments probably for close to a decade and we continue to make and the $1 billion numbers are estimate of what it\u2019s going to be in the next couple years coming up.","Geisha Williams","As a reminder, I would say most of it has already been approved but there is a component that we are still seeking recovery from in terms of our TO case.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And turning to the TO on the electric side, just curious how do you think about what the trajectory of electric transmission spend is over the next three to five years, kind of flattish to what you\u2019ve got in 2016, 2017 potentially elevated and what could be some of the drivers that could move that around?","Geisha Williams","Yes. I think as you look at the next -- clearly through 2019, you are going see a pretty flat but pretty robust spend in TO. And that\u2019s really driven by a number of things but a lot as we look beyond 2019 frankly, will be with renewals integration work. As we seek to achieve a 55% RPS goal by 2031, we recognized that we are going to need to continue to invest in our transmission infrastructure. So, a strong amount of capital through 2019 and although we are not providing guidance beyond it, I would imagine that we continue with the similar type of expenditure.","Michael Lapides","And then finally when I look at your CapEx budget, so kind of in the $6 billion range for the next three years, pretty flat actually, not kind of accelerating which is fine. But that would imply that free cash flow should improve, right because you get D&A, you have some other items like insurance proceeds and those things that add to some cash flow. So should we think about -- your earnings growth may slow down a little bit in the backend of this forecast because CapEx is just confined at the $6 billion level but maybe your cash flow actually accelerates each year relative to the prior one?","Tony Earley","I think that\u2019s -- there's a couple of things that are moving against towards those assumptions. So what we\u2019ve seen is sort of an increase in the regulatory lag for cash recoveries, certain items. One of the things that I would point to would be our expenditures for our wildfire prevention costs, which are pretty significant given the drought in the state and that\u2019s generally been taking us three years -- between the time we spend the money and when we collected in rates. And so there are offsetting factors that I would point to that would offset the cash acceleration that you mentioned.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Okay. Thanks guys. Much appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you, Michael. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Turnure with J.P. Morgan. You may proceed.","Chris Turnure","Good morning. I wanted to focus on the equity needs for next year. You saw a pretty good range there of $200 million. What is embedded in that assumption in terms of proceeds from insurance on the Butte fire or other factors that might move you to the top or bottom end of the range?","Tony Earley","We continue to expect to see recovery for all of our insured losses from insurers. There will be a timing lag between points in which we recognize the charge for the costs when we actually paid those and when we collect them. Since they are mostly timing related items, we\u2019d expect to try to finance as much as possible with short-term financing.","Chris Turnure","Okay. And when you think about the GT&S 2011 to \u201914 audit, you are kind of putting that into 2018 rate base. Right now is that a full assumption of the amount that\u2019s being reviewed and how can we think about the considerations that that audit group will be taking into consideration there?","Tony Earley","Yes. The $400 million reflect the full rate base impact subject to audits and we feel good about the spend. We feel it was prudent. We feel it was necessary. So, we are going to have to go through that out. You are going to have to make your assumptions around any perspective we will receive from our regulators but we feel confident enough to have proposed it and we will continue to seek recovery of it through the audit.","Chris Turnure","And what about timing there? Is early 2018 a conservative assumption that could be accelerated?","Tony Earley","There wasn\u2019t really a timing ascribed to the audit in the Phase 1 gas transmission rate case. So that\u2019s why we conservatively move the rate base impact to 2018. I think it\u2019s just going to be important to follow the timing of the audit here throughout 2017 to make assumptions on ultimate timing of collection.","Chris Turnure","Okay. That makes sense. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. You may proceed.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, guys. Question on the $1 billion grid modernization investment plan, how much of that or how much upside is there potentially when you look at that versus the distribution resource plan that are filed? Specifically, I\u2019m thinking of the amount that you originally intended to spend on let\u2019s say for example, electric vehicles. That\u2019s been pared back and I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s more -- if there is more spending that you would like to do beyond the $1 billion that just simply hasn\u2019t been approved yet or that you\u2019re not planning on filing immediately and how long could that go out for?","Geisha Williams","Hi, Michael. This is Geisha. We\u2019ve been at this grid modernization for quite some time now. And we\u2019ve continued to be making investments for the last five, six years and so what\u2019s reflected on page 20 is our estimate of the work that we intend to do through 2020. As we get more insights and we continue to work with the commission on the DER plan, on IDER and the DRP, there could be additional sort of changes along the way. But we would invest. We would actually seek that recovery through future rate cases. So, I think in terms of an outlook through 2020, I think what we are showing on page 20 is accurate.","Michael Weinstein","All right. Not expected to change much then. And then also on the equity range, just going back to that previous question that you said that the timing high versus low depends on insurance recoveries, is that accurate?","Tony Earley","No, I wouldn\u2019t count the insurance recoveries for the Butte fire in that equity issuance guidance. What I was referring to is there is going to be a timing difference between ultimately when we report the charge, when we pay out the cash and when we collect it from insurers. Since that is largely a timing related issue, financing those payments we will do so through short-term financing options.","Michael Weinstein","Like so how -- what are the factors that vary between the high and low end of the equity range for 2017?","Tony Earley","I think there is going to be a lot of factors in terms of sort of timing of recoveries. As I mentioned, I think we are seeing a trend towards a lag in cash recovery of certain expenditures, particularly as I mentioned wildfire prevention costs. Our last application for recovering those costs was about $200 million. And so we continue to accelerate the spend in terms of preventing wildfires here in the state because of the drought. So there are assumptions on the recovery that could push us, recovery of cash that could push us to the upper end of that range.","Michael Weinstein","Got you. Thank you","Operator","Thank you, Michael. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. You may proceed.","Anthony Crowdell","Good morning. Just a question on CWIP. I guess prior to the San Bruno incident, I think CWIP was split, half went to shareholders, half went for below-the-line costs. As you\u2019ve cleared maybe a lot of the issues related to the San Bruno incident, you\u2019ve cleared them up. Is there still a need with this level of below-the-line costs?","Tony Earley","It would be hard for us right now to say we could cut back on them. We still are dealing with some San Bruno issues. But also as we look forward with this size of capital investment, we\u2019ve got to make sure the public understands why we are investing in renewables, why we are investing in electric vehicles. So, I would be reluctant to say we could cut back on those costs in the next couple years certainly.","Anthony Crowdell","Okay. And just, last question and Anthony, you don\u2019t have to answer, that\u2019s fine. Just when you had started this endeavor of turning the company around, you looked at a timeframe of maybe three to four years, kind of in five years. I think the slides today you put out really show how much the company has been transformed over that time. Do you see yourself still around there through this transformation or you thinking other things?","Tony Earley","I\u2019m having a great time. I love seeing these slides. We pulled them together and you are making progress that when you lay them out. It\u2019s fun to see how things have come together. I talk to our Board all the time about our talent development plans and at some point we will make a decision about transition but I'm not going to speculate. I\u2019m having too good of a time.","Anthony Crowdell","Okay. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Thank you, Anthony. Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. You may proceed.","Praful Mehta","Thank you and thanks a lot for the slides. They are very helpful. Quick question on business update and I guess an important component of that is regulatory relationships. How do you see that having transitioned over this transformation and are there anything that you are looking to achieve, or any trackers that we should look for that would suggest where regulatory relationships stand today?","Steve Malnight","Hi. This is Steve Malnight. So, I would say we recognize that over the last several years we\u2019ve had a need to focus on rebuilding trust with our regulators and stakeholders externally. We have really made intensive efforts at that and are continuing to increase our engagement with commissioners, with staff, with interveners, all with clear eye toward the ex parte rules and restrictions. And I think that those kinds of efforts have really paid off as we are working on trying to settle key cases or other things.","So, we're going to really continue on that path and keep moving forward. I think that between the commission and PG&E we share tremendous common interest on ensuring that this company runs a safe, reliable, and affordable and clean system and that's we're going to keep working.","Geisha Williams","What I'd like to add too is, if you look at the role of the regulator I mean, they ultimately wanting sure that we're delivering safe and reliable service to our customers. And so, when you look at the slide deck that's been put together and you look at the type of improvement that we've made over the last five or six years, we feel good about it and we think it\u2019s a foundational basis of conversation with our regulators about the good work that we've done.","So, I think that it's about making sure you're delivering great service to your customers and that in turn ultimately we believe leads to improved relationships with our regulator as well.","Praful Mehta","Got you. That's very helpful. Thanks. And then, secondly in terms of retail rates, you've really pointed out that something that you're focused on which make sense. And as you're looking forward post 2019 and you're looking at growth rates relative to keeping retail rates in check. Is there is deepening off of the growth you see over time balancing off these different considerations or how do you see that growth being maintained through the post 2019 period?","Jason Wells","I think we are going to look at lot of factors here, Tony mentioned earlier on the call the fact that we've potentially got some headroom associated with our expiring procurement contracts. Our focus is continue to drive efficiency in our operations to keep our rates affordable. And kind of as we mentioned the trends we're seeing for capital investment, we think our longer term and extent beyond this 2019 period. So our objective is to kind of balance the need for that system investment while continuing to drive efficiencies in all aspects of the customers build.","Tony Earley","And there are structural things in rates that the commission has already laid out [audio gap] dynamic area, but we watch it very closely, so we don't get rates spiking in any part of the state.","Praful Mehta","Fair enough. Thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you, Praful. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fallon with Citgroup \u2013 I'm sorry Citadel. You may proceed.","Kevin Fallon","I had a question on slide 10 on the dividend that you are targeting in 2019 of $2.40. Are you guys implicitly trying to lead people to earnings power of $4 in 2019? Or does the roughly 60% payout range fall in the old guidance of 55% to 65%?","Jason Wells","I think we're not trying to lead there, we're trying to focus on a 60% payout ratio of our earnings to 2019 and our objective is to get there over the next several years. [audio gap] that's correct yes.","Kevin Fallon","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Kevin. Our next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar. You may proceed.","Travis Miller","All right. Thank you.","Jason Wells","Good morning.","Travis Miller","With respect to the grid modernization investments, the $1 billion and then any other extra that might come of that, how do you think about rate recovery for that? Are you thinking GRC? Are you thinking other trackers? Is there something else completely different out there? Help me think about the recovery of that?","Geisha Williams","I think you should think of it in terms of the regular recovery we through the GRC and the TO rate case, that's the approach we've taken over the last six to ten years now. We have been investing in our grid at a pretty good clip. It\u2019s a big part of the reason we're seeing the improved reliability and as we look at future GRC that will be the right mechanism for distribution and infrastructure improvements modernization and cases for the transmission piece.","Travis Miller","Got it. Are any of these initiatives you would expect to either request or get rate tracker treatment and annual true up type treatment?","Geisha Williams","The one that sort of a little bit different is probably the electric vehicle. That would be outside. It\u2019s a separate sort of filing. We're expecting to get a decision on that hopefully in the near term, so that's an example of one falls outside the GRC. And there could be others, but right now we don't think of anything else. We really do like putting everything for the GRC and using the TO rate case for transmission as well.","Travis Miller","Great. Appreciate it. Thanks.","Geisha Williams","You bet.","Operator","Thank you, Travis. There are currently no additional questions waiting in queue.","Janet Loduca","Alright. Great. Thanks Monique, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. We look forward to seeing many of you next week at the EEI conference. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen for attending the PG&E Corporation third quarter earnings conference. This will now conclude the conference. Please enjoy the rest of your day."],"17402":["PG&E (NYSE:PCG) Q3 2014 Earnings Call October 28, 2014 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Dinyar B. Mistry - Vice President and Controller","Anthony F.

[Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Dinyar Mistry. You may proceed.","Dinyar B. Mistry","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Before you hear from Tony Earley, Chris Johns and Kent Harvey, I'll remind you that our discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results based on assumptions, forecast, expectations and information currently available to management. Some of the important factors that could affect the company's actual financial results are described on the second page of today's slide deck. We also encourage you to review the Form 10-Q that will be filed with the SEC later today and the discussion of risk factors that appears there and in the 2013 annual report.","And with that, I'll hand it over to Tony.","Anthony F. Earley","Thank you, Dinyar, and good morning, everyone. This quarter had a number of significant developments in PG&E, and I know you're all interested in the impacts of the recent self-reports concerning ex parte communications. I'll get to that in a minute, but I also want to highlight several other key developments in the quarter. After a long wait, the presiding officer's decision has finally issued in the gas investigations, an important step in resolving the gas issues. We also received a final decision on our 2014 General Rate Case, which positions us well for the next few years. We had a strong quarter operationally and financially. Chris and Kent will cover those aspects of the business on the call this morning.","So, getting back to our regulatory issues. We've also had some setbacks in recent weeks in that very important area. We regret these developments. When I arrived 3 years ago, we knew that we had gaps in our performance, particularly in our gas business, and we launched major efforts to focus on operational excellence. We committed to seek out problems and to deal with them in a very transparent manner. Unfortunately, what we did not know was that we also had a gap in our CPUC communications protocols. All of this became apparent as a result of a voluntary review of communications between the company and the CPUC that we undertook after allegations of improper communications were raised this summer. We were disappointed to discover communications that we believe violated the CPUC's rules regarding ex parte communications, including in a pending Gas Transmission & Storage rate case.","As you know, we took decisive action. We self-reported these violations. We held individuals accountable. And we're taking meaningful steps to put in place a best-in-class regulatory compliance model to prevent another incident.","As you would expect, these ex parte violations have had a negative impact on the regulatory environment. Two commissioners have recused themselves from the pending decisions on both the San Bruno penalty and the Gas Transmission & Storage rate case.","Also in the gas transmission case, the administrative law judge has been replaced and the schedule has been suspended. The commission also launched an order to show cause calling for PG&E to demonstrate why it should not be penalized for the ex parte communications related to the initial assignment of the judge. The ALJ issued a proposed decision and Commissioner Peterman issued an alternate decision. Both called for extended restrictions on our ability to interact with the commission and advisory staff, except at all party meetings and require a notification of even routine interactions such as data responses.","Additionally, Commissioner Peterman proposed a $1 million fine and a disallowance of up to half the revenue requirement increase that would've been recovered during the delay in the gas transmission case. We've taken responsibility for the violations and understand that PG&E should be penalized, but we disagree strongly with these proposals. Silencing the company is not the answer. We believe it's a bad regulatory practice, particularly since the company self-reported and has taken responsibility for the actions. As a regulated utility, it's imperative that we be able to communicate appropriately with our regulators. And the CPUC must be able to communicate with utilities and other parties to reach informed decisions. We look to the commission to establish rules that strike the right balance going forward. But whatever their ultimate decision, we're committed to complying with it and we will work through these issues.","In addition to the CPUC, both the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco and the state attorney general's office have indicated they are investigating this matter. We are cooperating with the investigations, and our expectation is that this issue is going to take some time to be fully resolved. However long it takes, we're going to continue to do the right thing for our customers, for the communities that we serve and for our shareholders. That means, first of all, insisting on accountability, transparency and compliance with regulations and policies that govern our operations. It means continuing to strengthen and modernize our infrastructure and advance our operational performance through our continuous improvement efforts. We've made tremendous progress on both the electric and gas sides and we will not let up. It means advocating for resolution of the gas pipeline investigations and for penalties that are fair and proportionate. Yesterday, we filed our reply comments in the proceeding aimed at getting to that result. And it means rebuilding trust and an appropriate working relationship with the commission and other parties. We know this is going to take some time, but we are committed to it. The strength of the California regulatory model lies in the structures and policies that have been formalized over the last decade or more. It has been very successful and I don't see that changing.","So with that introduction, let me turn it over to Chris to update you on our operational performance.","Christopher P. Johns","Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. As you can see on Slide 4, I'll begin my remarks with an update on our operations and then touch on an additional regulatory development for the quarter.","For the last several years, we've been focused on strengthening and modernizing our infrastructure across our business. We saw some of the benefits of these investments in August when a 6.0 magnitude earthquake hit Napa Valley and resulted in significant property damage, with more than 70,000 of our customers experiencing outages. Using the data from the SmartMeters we've deployed over the last several years, our teams were able to quickly determine the extent of the outage and dispatch mobile command vehicles to rapidly establish an on-site presence. Technologies like fault location and isolation devices minimized the duration and impact of power outages on our customers, and our employees worked around the clock to restore power to all of our impacted customers generally within 24 hours.","On the gas side, we addressed almost 6,000 customer calls regarding gas odors, leaks and re-lights and completed 2,500 courtesy gas safety checks in the following days. We also used our state of the art leak detection vehicles to patrol more than 200 miles of gas transmission pipeline. Individuals in the communities we serve as well as local and state officials, expressed significant appreciation for our concerted efforts following the earthquake. It's clear that the investments we've made over the past few years on both our electric and gas infrastructure, really made a difference in Napa, as did the work we've been doing on emergency preparedness.","Shifting briefly to regulatory matters. Tony covered the general rate case and the pending gas investigations as well as the current state of the Gas Transmission & Storage rate case. I'll just add that on September 30 the FERC accepted our Transmission Owner 16 rate case for our electric transmission business and suspended the rates until March 1, 2015, subject to refund. As a reminder, in that case, we proposed an ROE of 11.26% along with an increased revenue requirement as we continue to make investments in our electric transmission infrastructure.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Kent.","Kent M. Harvey","Thank you, Chris. I have a lot to cover this morning. First, I plan to go through our Q3 results, which were significantly impacted by the final decision in our general rate case. I'll walk you through all of that. And then, I plan to spend some time on our outlook going forward.","I'll start on Slide 5 with the overall results for Q3. Earnings from operations for the quarter were $1.73 and GAAP results were $1.71. Before I get to earnings from operations, let me just quickly address the items impacting comparability. Natural gas matters totaled $0.03 negative for the quarter, and you can see from the table at the bottom that was comprised of pipeline-related expenses of $108 million pretax, offset by insurance recoveries of $86 million during the quarter.","Back to the table to the top, you'll also see that we booked $0.01 positive in environmental-related costs for the quarter, a small pickup in connection with our efforts at Hinkley, which have been treated as an item impacting comparability in prior years.","Moving on to earnings from operations. Slide 6 shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison with last year. As I said, the 2014 general rate case was a big driver because we booked the year-to-date impact all in Q3 when we received the final decision. The first 4 items here relate primarily to the GRC, and they total $0.77. I'm going to go through each of them.","First, as a result of the GRC, our expense recovery increased $0.28 quarter-over-quarter. As you know, the past couple of years, we've been spending at levels higher than authorized, across the utility to improve operations. This item represents the impact of now recovering this higher spending level for the first 3 quarters of this year. It also offsets the negative item you saw for GRC expense recovery in Qs 1 and 2. Second, we recorded earnings on a higher authorized rate base, and this totaled $0.14. Again, this is the year-to-date impact, all recorded in Q3. Third, we had a positive $0.18 in the quarter, resulting from tax benefits related to our federal tax deduction for repairs cost. As with one of the other California utilities, our general rate case decision authorized flow-through treatment of the federal repairs deduction. The $0.18 booked to this quarter reflects the fact that our estimate of this deduction has increased due to recent IRS guidance as well as other factors affecting the size of the deduction. Again, we recorded the year-to-date impact of these benefits all in Q3. Fourth, we had an additional $0.17 pickup, mainly related to the timing of taxes and other expenses. This item was driven by the delay in the general rate case decision. And unlike the first 3 items I've covered, we expect this one to reverse in Q4.","So those are the 4 components that related primarily to the GRC decision. As you see, we also had some smaller items in the quarter, another gain on SolarCity stock and a small pickup on some regulatory matters. There also was a host of miscellaneous items totaling $0.08 in the quarter, however, on a year-to-date basis, our miscellaneous items net to a negligible amount. And finally, we had share dilution of $0.05 negative. That gets you to $1.73. Suffice it to say, we had an unusual quarter with a lot going on, mostly related to the final decision in our general rate case.","Now I'd like to move on to our outlook going forward. The GRC decision resolved a lot of uncertainty for the company for this year. Of course, the final outcome of the gas investigations is still pending and we anticipate the ultimate impact will be significant. But at this point in the year, it's unlikely to be a big driver of our average share count for 2014. Therefore, with the GRC resolved, we believe it now makes sense to provide 2014 guidance for earnings from operations.","On Slide 7, you'll see updates to some of our key assumptions underlying guidance such as CapEx and authorized rate base. These primarily reflect the changes we previewed last quarter based on the proposed GRC decision, although we've made some other updates as well. In the upper left, you see we're assuming CapEx of roughly $5 billion this year. And in the upper right, weighted average authorized rate base of about $28 billion. There haven't been any changes in our assumptions regarding authorized return on equity and equity ratio shown in the lower left.","In terms of the other factors affecting earnings from operations this year shown in the lower right, we've previously indicated that these factors should roughly net to 0 for the year. However, that was without the impact of the tax benefits associated with the repairs deduction. With these tax benefits included, we now believe that these factors taken together should result in an overall positive of roughly $0.25 per share for the year. By the way, we expect this impact to be fairly similar next year as well.","Turning to Slide 8. You'll see that these assumptions lead us to provide a guidance range for earnings from operations in 2014 of between $3.45 and $3.55 per share. Again, the primary driver is the resolution of our general rate case, which provides us the opportunity to earn our authorized return on equity on a higher level of rate base in 2014.","Additionally, we expect 2014 earnings from operations to reflect the impact of the tax benefits related to the repairs deductions and the other factors covered on Slide 7, which, together, should total roughly $0.25 this year.","Moving on to Slide 9. You'll see we've narrowed our 2014 guidance range for the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters of between $350 million and $400 million pretax. Our previous range was $350 million to $450 million. At this stage in the year, we've tightened our range for PSEP expenses. We've also reduced and narrowed the range for non-PSEP expenses, in part due to the delays we've experienced in clearing encroachments on our pipeline rights-of-way. We've also narrowed our estimates of legal costs. As an aside, although our PSEP expense work for pressure testing is going well, we continue to find our PSEP capital work, mainly pipeline replacement, a challenge. We expect some of our PSEP capital work to be completed in 2015 rather than this year, mainly due to permitting delays. We continue to work hard to manage a variety of cost pressures affecting our capital work.","On Slide 10, you can see we've narrowed our estimates for 2014 equity issuance between $800 million and $900 million, excluding resolution of the gas investigation. Our previous estimate was $800 million to $1 billion. We're bringing the estimate down a bit due to the net impact of the various items shown on this Slide 10. During Q3, we issued about $160 million of common stock, and that brought us to about $760 million issued through the end of Q3.","We are not providing earnings guidance today for future years, but on Slides 11 and 12, we've updated our guidance ranges for CapEx and rate base through 2016 to reflect the final decision in our general rate case as well as current expectations of other cases. As you can see, we expect to maintain a robust capital program into the future as we continue to replace aging infrastructure as well as overlay technology on the grid.","Our total CapEx is expected to remain north of $5 billion annually during this period. Our average rate base of about $28 billion in 2014 is expected to grow to more than $33 billion in 2016, and that represents a CAGR in the 9% range.","I think that's it for the financials. So I'm going to stop here, and we will open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Listen, just kind of on the -- I know that we're not getting into 2015 guidance and there's a lot that has to happen before then, but is it still fair to assume with the GT&S prospective delays, that you remain confident concerning your -- a lot of ROEs of both the utilities and the gas businesses next year? Or is that a little more in question at this moment?","Kent M. Harvey","That's still our objective for 2015, yes.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then the timing of equity, the $800 million, $900 million for this year, that is adjusted to assume no additional resolution on the San Bruno expenses or fines between now and year end, is that correct?","Kent M. Harvey","Well, our previous guidance on equity issuance actually did not include resolution of the San Bruno penalty. It's mainly adjusted for the items we've shown on Slide 10. So we do have slightly lower CapEx, just mainly given the timing of the general rate case. Some CapEx will probably see next year as compared to this year. And remember, our original guidance for CapEx was slightly different. It was -- excuse me, for equity issuance was based on the midpoint of our prior CapEx range, and the range we're providing now is somewhat lower for 2014. We also have somewhat lower unrecovered gas costs. I just went through our guidance there for the unrecovered gas costs coming down slightly. We did get a depreciation rate change, not what we asked for in the general rate case, but some improvement in depreciation rate. And then on the other hand, there was -- somewhat mitigating that was, the GRC decision was delayed. So we've gotten less cash now through revenues this year as compared to what we had originally contemplated. So the net of all that is to bring down the upper end of the range a bit.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And I guess just on the interveners last night with their comments on the pod. There seems to be a huge amount of debate ultimately on the total amount of money they would like for you to hand over. What do you guys see as kind of the next steps from here? And if the number ends are coming at where the pod recommended, how are you guys evaluating your kind of legal recourse as next steps given the significant penalties associated?","Anthony F. Earley","Well, obviously, we've got to see the numbers. We yesterday filed additional comments objecting to pieces of the decision. But quite honestly, on the flip side, there is some benefit to getting finality and getting things done. So we -- the way we've been playing is, we'll take a look at the totality, the circumstances when we get that decision and then have to decide whether we want to appeal pieces of it or whether we just try and move on from there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So first question, if you could clarify just a little bit, is the 2015 -- I want to use the word guidance, but the view on taxes, shall we say, can you break that out a little bit more granularly in terms of what the $0.25 is comprised of? And then subsequently, not to read too far further, but 2016 as well, is there expectation for that as well just given the timeline associated with rate cases?","Kent M. Harvey","Julien, this is Kent. The $0.25 that I provided on the call, the roughly $0.25, is for the combination of all the factors that are listed on Slide 7. Those other factors affecting earnings from operations, but the big change from last quarter are the tax benefits. The tax benefits, we do see them being triggered by the outcome of the general rate case, and so we do see them existing through the rate case periods, so that's through 2016. We haven't broken down the other items for you previously, and I don't intend to at this point in the year either. We've not -- I'm not providing a specific number for next year, but I was indicating that we thought of a similar order of magnitude for next year.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","But no necessary composition, should we say?","Kent M. Harvey","No. I don't think it makes sense. We really need to see what those other factors are going to look like next year on that slide. And the tax benefits again, similar order of magnitude next year or this year.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then secondly, just a little different. On the transmission ROE front, you provided some commentary here briefly in the slide. Can you elaborate a little bit, what kind of ROE should we be thinking about going forward coming out of this?","Anthony F. Earley","Well, Julien, our guidance for this year was assuming essentially on average for our whole business, 10 4 [ph]. As Chris indicated, we've requested a higher amount from the FERC in our TO16 filing, 11 26 [ph]. We have to see how that case proceeds, but in general, I would expect when we do get around to providing guidance for next year, I would say overall for our company assuming something around 10 4 [ph] probably makes sense. We don't know how the FERC stuff is going to come out. It's still early in that process.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So you're not reading necessarily out of the FERC decisions in the last quarter, any new changes to the request that you put in? That's really what I was getting at.","Kent M. Harvey","Yes. Not at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of questions on the rate base and CapEx numbers. First, I was just curious sort of versus the last quarter's numbers, the generation rate base seemed to kicked up a couple of hundred million dollars in 2014. Any explanation sort of what drove that? I thought the number last quarter was going to -- what you were expecting from the GRC.","Kent M. Harvey","Yes, Jonathan, this is Kent. You're right. It is a bit different. I think one of the factors there was we had some adjustments related to our utility-owned photovoltaic. So that program kind of completed, but we had to true up some numbers in that. Otherwise, we didn't see any significant changes in our overall results.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, all right. My second one, if I look at the rate base forecast, the CapEx forecast. The CapEx is obviously a little bit lower this year, but then it's $400 million or $500 million higher of the midpoint versus sort of GRC midpoint from the last quarter slides in both '15 and '16, and yet your rate base forecast is essentially unchanged, a tiny bit higher in '16, but -- so you seem to be spending $0.5 billion more of CapEx each year but ending up at the same place on rate base. Can you explain what's going on there?","Dinyar B. Mistry","Yes, Jonathan, this is Dinyar. We're actually a little lower on CapEx in 2014 because of the delay in the general rate case. And also the way the attrition revenues come out, they don't result in kind of like an even CapEx program, but the way we spend our capital is a little more even. So that's what's causing that phenomenon that you're seeing.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","But why would that be a change versus what you showed us last quarter for the GRC sort of estimate?","Dinyar B. Mistry","Well, last quarter, what we showed you is what the CapEx would have been with the -- implied by the general rate case decision. So it would've been really tracking whatever the revenues that were implied in the GRC whereas here we're showing you what we think our CapEx spending profile is going to be. So over the 3-year rate case cycle, they should be pretty much the same. It's just that in each year they look a little different.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So is it essentially the kind of delay effectively compounds a little into the future?","Dinyar B. Mistry","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I want to follow on John's question a little bit, because if I just look at it on a cumulative basis, and I'm comparing Slide 10 from your last quarter's deck to Slide 11 of today's deck. The total CapEx number, if I just kind of sum it up is actually a higher number in today's deck than it was in Slide 10. That would almost make it seem like rate base by the end of the period would be a higher number unless there's some other offset like D&A or maybe an assumption around bonus or higher add set. I just want to make sure I understand that. It's one thing, if it's lower in '14 and higher in '16, but if I just do the sum of the 3, it seems like it's a higher number in terms of the total CapEx over the 3-year period, and yet the rate base number isn't up by nearly the same amount.","Dinyar B. Mistry","Well, Michael, we actually recalculated our rate base based on the GRC and all of the other factors in there. And one of the things we did do is we did take -- we did kind of relook at our deferred taxes as well. So that is the component of the adjustments. We can go over it in more detail, but essentially, the way to think about it is that what we showed previously is what would have been implied by the GRC PD, but we didn't adjust for anything else. And this time around, we've pretty much looked at the totality of the things that we see coming up and we've made those changes.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay, I'll follow up off-line.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Hopefully, we'll get the main San Bruno penalty result soon, but there's still kind of reverberations in the coming years. I wanted to try to get a little bit of clarity on those. Is there any update on the federal case that was brought by the U.S. attorney?","Anthony F. Earley","Let me ask Hyun Park to comment on it, our General Counsel.","Hyun Park","There is really not much update. We have a status conference that's scheduled for November 13. And at that status conference, we may get a better sense of the schedule for the case going forward.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Have you been notified of any legal action related to the ex parte communications?","Anthony F. Earley","We're aware that both the U.S. Attorney's Office and the California Attorney General's office are investigating the circumstances. I said, we're fully cooperating with both those investigations.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Could you just update us briefly on the extent of delay in the GT&S case that you expect as a result of the ex parte?","Anthony F. Earley","We can't speculate on the extent of the delay. We did get a new administrative law judge in the case, but the case had not gone to hearings, the formal hearings yet. So we're early on in the process -- I don't know if we have any further information on the exact days, but I think we expect that shortly we'll get a schedule.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then final question on the PSEP expenditures. Do you have any estimates of what we'll been looking at? Well, I shouldn't say PSEP but unrecovered expenditures related to the gas work. Do you have any estimates of what we'll be looking at next year?","Kent M. Harvey","Hugh, this is Kent. Really, the items that we have talked about continuing into next year and frankly, through 2017 is the costs associated with our efforts to clear our rights-of-way. We do anticipate that we'll have some continuing legal costs. Obviously, these proceedings have gone on for some time. And then the significant question mark is really sort of the outcome of the fines and penalties part of it for the natural gas matters because it's looking like those could be booked beyond this year or 2, it just depends on the timing.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And just on the rights-of-way, what's your latest view in terms of outlet?","Anthony F. Earley","Chris, do you want to...","Christopher P. Johns","Yes. We've -- we continue to move forward with that program, and really we're in the same position that we were in the second quarter when we said that we don't anticipate exceeding the $500 million number that we've given. There's some timing issues that we've got right now, but we still anticipate to being able to complete the plan on our original schedule.","Hyun Park","I just want to make one correction. I said November 13 for the status conference. It's actually November 3.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kit Konolige with BGC.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Do you guys have any sense if the commission feels that they should await a replacement for President Peevey before making decisions in either? Well, obviously, there will be a replacement before the GT&S case, but before the San Bruno issues are resolved?","Anthony F. Earley","Well, from a legal standpoint, the commission can make a decision with the 3 commissioners, need a majority vote, so 2 commissioners can vote out a case. We have no indication that they're going to wait until they get a replacement.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","And has there been any discussion publicly of who the new commissioner might be appointed to replace Peevey and\/or if the governor would be interested in any of the current commissioners as the new President? Or would we expect the President and a replacement to be named at the same time?","Anthony F. Earley","Again, from a legal standpoint, the governor can select one of the sitting commissioners and name him or her chair, but we're just not going to speculate on who might be the replacements.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And one final question on financing. Kent, can you give us any sense of the timing of equity issuance over the rest of this year and then into next year? I assume it's dependent on the outcome of several of these cases. Can you give us a sense of how much is dependent on what?","Kent M. Harvey","Well, Kit, for this year, we've issued $760 million through the end of the third quarter. So I would anticipate putting aside the resolution of the gas investigations that we would just rely on our internal programs for the remainder of the year in order to achieve our range of $800 million to $900 million. So we're pretty far along in that program for this year. The uncertainty really is the timing and the form of the resolution of the gas investigations. And as we've previously talked about, depending upon the variety of how that can play out, the timing and the form of our financing can be very, very different. And so we're just going to have to see if the presiding officer decision is voted out or something different.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Yes, I just sort of wanted to follow-up on that. One of the transmission pipeline operations proposed deadline extension. A lot of the issues that they sort of mentioned there would seem to maybe apply to San Bruno. When do you think we might get more clarity as to what they might do with respect to the review process? And just in general, do we have any other sense about how the San Bruno case itself might -- with the timing associated with it?","Anthony F. Earley","Paul, could you clarify what you're telling me. In terms of the San Bruno case, all of the materials now have been submitted by the parties, so it's ripe for decision.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Right. I understand, but I mean it seems that there were 2 commissioners who've recused themselves. You have a couple of commissioners asking for reviews, right? I'm just wondering whether or not that might lead to more of a delay? Or do you guys think that, that won't have an impact?","Anthony F. Earley","The reviews -- the requests there are around [ph] alternate decisions, and that's a fairly normal process. Commissioners can, in fact, propose alternatives and the commission generally works through those, whether it's days, weeks or longer, it's hard to speculate, but I think the commission, generally when they get to this stage, moves along pretty quickly, but we can't predict how long it's going to be.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I mean, I just wanted to follow-up on that because it's a little unusual just the case itself, but okay. And then just in terms of the ex parte and all that stuff, is it correct that you guys -- is my understanding correct that you guys have done your internal review subject to pretty much all of the proceedings that are going on at the PG -- that you guys have going at the CPUC and at least yourself investigation is over, and we're not going to probably hear much more from that at least?","Anthony F. Earley","Yes, so -- I mean, we've reviewed a huge number of e-mail communications focusing on those between the PG&E and the commission because that's where you'd have an ex parte communication. But as I said before, there are investigations underway. We're cooperating with those investigations, and it's likely we're going to have to undertake additional reviews that will be necessary in the context of those investigations. So I can't say we're not reviewing any further e-mails. It's going to take some time to get through that full resolution as we work through those investigations. I can't say in the meantime, we've taken the appropriate actions to self-report all the violations that we've identified. We held people accountable and we're working to create a best-in-class regulatory compliance program, so we don't have incidents of this kind in the future.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I'm sure you are, Tony. I guess, what I was wondering was -- so in other words, the investigation -- I guess, the investigation continues insofar as your cooperation with these other investigations are going on? Or are you guys having a separate internal investigation that's continuing with respect to the CPUC interaction?","Anthony F. Earley","I think the way I'd characterize is what we're looking at is trying to stay ahead of those investigations. You don't want to be surprised and -- either in direct response or drawing some conclusions about where those questions may come. That's what we're looking at largely.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I was wondering about the $0.77, the catch-up from the GRC. How much of that was third quarter such that we get a real comp against the $0.88? So we see that kind of year-over-year impact in terms of the appreciation from the GRC decision?","Dinyar B. Mistry","This is Dinyar. I think the best way to think about it, let's go through each of those components. The first one, the 2014 GRC expense recovery, that is a 3-quarter catch-up. So that is really for 3 quarters worth. So we should expect to see one more quarter of that in Q4. And again, the way to think about this is that this represents overspending that we were doing in previous years to improve operations, and so it's just getting revenues to recover those costs. I will say embedded in that $0.28 is about $0.08 worth of previously kind of like a timing delay from the previous 2 quarters, as Kent mentioned. So if you kind of look at it, it's on a year-to-date basis $0.21. The next item, the growth in rate base earnings. Again, that's a 3-quarters catch-up. And so you can expect to see one more quarter of that next quarter. Similarly with the tax benefit of the $0.18. On the $0.17, as Kent said, of timing of taxes and other expenses, we expect that to fully reverse in Q4. So that will be the way to think of each of those components.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And are each of these components just about evenly spread such that we could take, say, the $0.28 net of that $0.08 adjustment and just divide it by 3 to get an idea of what Q4 would be and to get an idea what your third quarter was?","Dinyar B. Mistry","That's true for the second and the third component. The first one, remember, we actually had some under recovery in Q1 and Q2. But the way to think about the first one, the $0.28, is that it's $0.21 on a year-to-date basis.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, right. And then with the FERC proposal, TO16. Given we've had the ISO New England and the MISO thoughts at least from FERC, what's your thinking now regarding TO16? What's the nature of the conversations now that we have some more recent, I don't want to say precedent, but certainly, thoughts from the FERC?","Kent M. Harvey","This is Kent, Travis. I just think it's still -- I view it as still fairly early on in the FERC process. I think there's been a reasonably encouraging trend at the FERC. And certainly, with the New England case, it seems as if the FERC is open to not applying the DCF model so mechanically. There's an acknowledgment that there are shortcomings and there are always anomalies in the market and those need to be considered. And so there's an overall sort of question about reasonableness, and I think that's really healthy and I hope we're going to end up with more reasonable outcomes going forward, but we haven't gone through our case and we haven't seen a whole lot of cases yet, post these developments at the FERC, so we'll see how that goes.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Did you use the DCF, primarily the 11 26 [ph]?","Kent M. Harvey","We do use the DCF in our analysis.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of questions. As it relates to the tax benefits that you're seeing in '14, and you pointed to them showing up in '15, will they continue into '16? Or is it just going through '15?","Kent M. Harvey","This is Kent, Rajeev. Yes, we do expect that the tax benefits will continue through this general rate case cycle, which is through 2016.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And would the amount be similar to what you noted in '15 for '16?","Kent M. Harvey","I would say, kind of on an order of magnitude, but I wouldn't want to get more precise on that at this point.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then Kent, this is another question for you. As it relates to providing an updated longer-term financial outlook, what are you envisioning once you're hopefully done with the investigation on San Bruno and the penalties et cetera, as well as maybe the GT&S case?","Kent M. Harvey","I continue to believe that the key milestone for us is the resolution of the San Bruno penalties. And so that's really the milestone that I'm looking for before I would consider doing more of a longer-term outlook at this point.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just one last question. Tough to ask in the complexity of the issue. As it relates to the proposed decision on the ex parte issue, did that cover just what you disclosed on the GT&S side? Or does it cover on all e-mails that you disclosed in ex parte communications, if that makes sense?","Kent M. Harvey","Yes. And the judge -- administrative law judge made it clear, the focus that was just the GT&S issues. I think we submitted the second round of issues just right before the hearing in that case, so they kept that segregated. We don't know what they're going to do with the other filing.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So no idea on timeline et cetera, as it relates to resolving that aspect?","Kent M. Harvey","We don't have any timeline on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I was just -- when you look at 2015 CapEx, it's a pretty tight range, $5.4 billion to $5.6 billion. Is there a way you could give us the, I guess, equity issuance forecast for '15 as you did -- you gave us for '14, which does not reflect the resolution of the gas investigation since it's a pretty tight range and if you just exclude the gas investigation, what you think the equity needs would be?","Kent M. Harvey","Anthony, this is Kent. We're not at this stage yet for giving equity issuance for 2015, but I would point you to something we have been suggesting to people as sort of a shorthand way of understanding, sort of the underlying equity needs resulting from our rate base growth, and that is to look at our year-over-year growth in rate base and taking that difference and looking at 52% of it. That's the amount that needs to be financed with equity. You'd want to take away from that the fact that we retain some of our earnings. So you'd want to look at our earnings less the dividends for that year, and what remains after you net that amount is generally the equity that needs to be raised externally. And so that gives you a good ballpark estimate when you look year-over-year.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Does that exclude then -- is that calculation -- you don't really then include any benefit from deferred taxes, right?","Kent M. Harvey","Well, it does essentially because the rate base figure reflects changes in deferred taxes. I think implicitly, it's in there. So it's just an easier approach to take. The other thing to just keep in mind is whatever unrecovered costs we have, that's usually the other increment of equity needs.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium.","Ashar Khan","Kent, I just wanted to -- I guess, just so I understand. So you came up with the guidance range, and from that you're saying that $0.25 of it are related to certain tax matters primarily and others, but that $0.25 or roughly approximate to that would remain there for '14, '15 and '16 through this rate case cycle?","Kent M. Harvey","Yes, I indicated a similar order of magnitude for the tax piece in '15 and '16. On Slide 7, however, we show a number of factors that in 2014 are affecting earnings from operations. Those will change year-over-year. And so you'd want to look at those as well and make your own assessment.","Ashar Khan","Well, is there anything in one of those that reverses itself? Because it seems to be -- like the way you went over them right was basically majority of them were relating to picking things up on the GRC, which seems like to be a normal part of picking up the rate case.","Kent M. Harvey","Some of the other factors that are shown on the bottom right part of Slide 7 include under earning on our Gas Transmission & Storage business, which were hoped to address through the GT&S case. We also have the monetizing of the shares of SolarCity, and to date, we've done about 2\/3 of those shares this year. So you shouldn't expect that that continues at the same pace in subsequent years. Those are just some examples of how some of these items will change year-over-year.","Ashar Khan","Okay. Fair enough.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Kent, sorry, just a bit on the same topic. I just want to clarify. Previously, you've said you're not asking for -- about -- for recovery of about $50 million of annual expense in the GT&S, and that you would -- you would hope to be able to offset that. Is the sort of $0.25 part of how you offset that under earning? Or is that -- is it sort of -- is the $0.25 net of that starting point?","Kent M. Harvey","Well, let me just unpack that a little bit. So again, what I'm saying for 2014 is all of those factors in the lower right, on average, should be roughly $0.25 for this year. Since you know that last quarter we had a guidance for those factors of roughly net to 0, your conclusion is that the tax benefits are the main driver there of that $0.25, and I think that's reasonable. I've also indicated that in subsequent years, 2015 and 2016, that magnitude of the tax benefits will be comparable, similar order of magnitude. And so I'm tracking with you to that point. I do agree that we have not requested all of our costs in the Gas Transmission & Storage case and your estimate of roughly $50 million is reasonable to me as well. So I think it follows that the tax benefits could offset that amount, but there are a lot of other items in our financial results that could also offset it. So I wouldn't necessarily just pair those, but I think that that's a reasonable way to think about it.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Slightly differently. I mean, are you intending to offset that $50-odd million of unrecovered expense absent tax benefits?","Kent M. Harvey","Yes. I mean, we'd like to, overall, be able to earn our authorized return. The tax benefits we'd like to have as an increment, but we have to -- we still haven't actually gotten through the Gas Transmission & Storage case.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital.","Andrew Levi","I thought I was clear on this tax thing, but now I actually have a question. So just to kind of ask the question another way. So really all year, you were saying that 2015, you should be able to earn your allowed return, and whether you do or not, we'll see and I have faith that you will be able to. But when you said that earlier in the year, did it contemplate this tax benefit from the repairs method?","Kent M. Harvey","Andy, I don't know if it did or not at this point. The tax benefit is a fairly recent development, so probably not. I guess you guys are asking similar questions multiple ways, and to me, it's pushing me more and more towards sort of guidance of earnings, and I'd like to sort of leave things the way I've said them to date, which is that we would expect that the benefit from the taxes going forward should be roughly comparable to this year and the next couple of years and that we do still hope to earn our overall authorized return for the company.","Andrew Levi","Okay. And let me just follow-up. So again, I'll ask it one other way, just to torture you. So let's -- it doesn't matter what the number was. I assume $3 in earnings for next year, it doesn't matter whether that's correct or incorrect, and it had not contemplated this tax benefit. I would just basically add that to whatever number I thought it was because it's incremental to whatever that number is -- I mean, is that kind of the way to think about it?","Kent M. Harvey","The tax benefit is a significant change from last quarter on the list of the other factors that are on Slide 7.","Andrew Levi - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. I think I got it now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jesse Laudon with Nexus Asset Management.","Craig Martin Lucas","It's actually Craig Lucas. I just wanted to ask a question about this ex parte communication issue. Just -- I'm sorry that, if it's redundant, I apologize for that, but I just want to be sure about something that -- so right now the case centers around the GPS case and the ex parte communication there, and that's because it was only really there and regarding the gas pressure issue that you found in the ex parte communication when you reviewed all the e-mails, is that correct?","Anthony F.

[Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Gabe Togneri with PG&E. Thank you, and enjoy your call. You may proceed, Mr. Togneri","Gabriel B. Togneri","Thanks, Juanique. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As usual, you'll be hearing from Tony Earley, Chris Johns and Kent Harvey. And I'm going to remind you that the discussion will include forward-looking statements about future financial results based on the assumptions and expectations reflecting information currently available to management. Some of the important factors that could affect the company's results are described in Exhibit 1 located in the appendix of today's slides. And we also encourage you to review the Form 10-Q that will be filed with the SEC later today and the discussion of risk factors that appears in the 2012 annual report. And with that, I'll hand it over to Tony.","Anthony F. Earley","Thank you, Gabe, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by saying we had another solid quarter operationally, consistent with our plans, and we continue to make progress towards top quartile performance throughout the business. As usual, Chris will highlight a few points on our operational performance, and Kent will go through the financial results.","I'll focus my remarks today on an update of the various gas issues. Most of the recent activity and attention has been centered around the regulatory arena. Late yesterday, we received an ALJ ruling requesting that we and the other parties submit information about the impact penalties would have on our ability to raise capital. Responses are due August 14 and September 13. We're disappointed to see the ALJ's ruling, which results in significant delays in this already protracted proceeding. We understand the desire to punish the company for past behavior, but more importantly, the process should ensure that past practices are corrected and that we meet new, higher standards. Since the San Bruno accident, the company has made significant improvements and has committed substantial resources and shareholder dollars. Instead of recognizing that commitment, CPUC staff and other parties want to identify how much additional pain the company can bear, and their resulting recommendations have lost all perspective. Ultimately, if the safety division or the other parties' recommendations are adopted, total shareholder-funded spending on unrecoverable gas pipeline work and fines would exceed $4 billion. This is obviously excessive. We believe strongly that the commission's final decision should recognize the huge amount of gas safety work we've already completed and the billions of dollars being spent without recovery from customers. We will continue to urge the commission to bring these proceedings to a reasonable conclusion as soon as possible.","With respect to the criminal investigation, we continue to provide information, as requested by the federal, state and county attorney. And although it's uncertain criminal charges may be brought against the company, they've been at this now for about 2 years and, like you, we'd like to have it resolved.","Regarding civil litigation, as you know, we settled all of the most serious cases a few months ago. I'm pleased that we've been able to resolve many of these cases, and we're now focused on settling the remaining cases, and the judge has put in place a process to do just that.","So now I'll turn things over to Chris.","Christopher P. Johns","Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. As you can see on Slide 3, I'm going to start with a couple of regulatory items and then provide some updates on operations. Tony already provided you with an update on the gas event, so I'm going to go right into the General Rate Case. And I'm pleased that so far, the General Rate Case is progressing on track. We're currently in the midst of hearings, which started earlier this month and are scheduled to end by August 9. As we've previously discussed, this case includes a few new steps in the process. For example, the commission asked the safety division to affirm that our electric and gas proposals are appropriately focused on the safety of the system. In May, 2 consultants hired by the safety division submitted their reports reviewing how we address safety and security issues, including risk assessment and mitigation. The consultants provided some constructive comments for us to consider, but they also recognized the overall improvements we're making, including our integrated planning process and risk-management adjustments as well as safety improvements. These reports contrasted with the fairly extreme filing by the division ratepayer advocates. DRA didn't even acknowledge many of our specific requests for safety and risk mitigation, and actually suggested that revenue should be decreased from the current amounts.","In our electric transmission business last week, we filed our TO15 rate case with the FERC. The request incorporates a slight decrease in the revenue requirement to a little over $1 billion and includes an ROE of 10.9%. We derived the ROE using the median of our proxy group, like other applicants. We anticipate the FERC would allow the new rate to become effective in October.","That brings me to operations. The attached slide shows the status of our efforts related to pipeline replacement, valve installation and mileage of hydrostatic testing. Some of these numbers might suggest a lower run rate than you'd expect, but we need more flexibility on our pipeline system in the first part of the year, so much of this work will occur in the next 2 quarters. We continue to actively manage our unit costs related to hydrostatic testing and have successfully brought those costs down significantly since we launched the pipeline safety enhancement program in 2011.","This quarter, we notified the NTSB that we've completed work on 2 more of their recommendations on integrity management and pipeline threat assessment. Assuming the NTSB approves our request to close out these items, we will have only 3 of the original 12 recommendations remaining, and these 3 involve multi-year programs to complete. This clearly demonstrates the significant progress we've made in improving safety and strengthening our gas operations over the past 2 years. Given the tremendous work involved, this is no small feat, and I'm proud of how far the team has come.","On the rights-of-way, we've completed more than 1,600 miles of the Centerline survey during the second quarter and approximately 3,200 miles so far this year. We expect to survey all 6,700 miles of our system by the end of the year.","To date, we have identified fewer significant encroachments than we originally anticipated. However, we have a long way to go on the survey, particularly in the more populated parts of the service area, and we've only just begun the remediation effort. At this time, we're maintaining the cost estimate of roughly $500 million over 5 years.","Shifting gears to power generation, I'm pleased to report that our Gateway plant just achieved its fourth consecutive year without a safety incident. This demonstrates the daily personal commitment to safety on the part of every member of that team, and I'm really proud of their significant achievement.","We also recently completed a successful 6-month planned maintenance outage of our Helms Pumped Storage power plant. Helms has been operating for 30 years, and the recent equipment replacements there will help us to achieve ongoing, reliable and sustainable hydropower. Helms is a great resource for us and our customers, particularly during the summer months, when our peak loads are at their highest. Finally, at the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant, we had a couple of small unscheduled outages during this quarter. In both cases, the systems and processes in place worked as intended. The team did a great job identifying and correcting the issues and quickly restoring operations.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Kent.","Kent M. Harvey","Thanks, Chris, and good morning. As usual, I'm going to go through our Q2 results as well as guidance. And I thought I'd also spend a few minutes quantifying the substantial amount of gas pipeline safety work that shareholders have funded to date and that we've committed to fund, and then I'll also cover the potential impact of the safety division's revised recommendations.","Slide 4 summarizes the results for the quarter. Earnings from operations were $0.79 per share, and our GAAP results were $0.74. The difference between the 2 is our items impacting comparability. The item related to natural gas matters totaled $0.04 in the quarter and is broken out in pretax dollars in the table at the bottom of the slide. Pipeline-related costs totaled $74 million pretax in Q2. This includes our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan work, our rights-of-way and integrity management work and then our legal costs.","As Chris mentioned, work on our pipelines is somewhat seasonal and is expected to increase in the second half of the year. And similarly, we expect our remediation activities associated with rights-of-way encroachment to also ramp up in the second half. During Q2, there were no changes in our penalty accrual of $200 million associated with potential fines in connection with the gas pipeline investigation. Obviously, this accrual is subject to change as the CPUC process comes to a conclusion.","There were no additional accruals for third-party liabilities in Q2. However, we did recognize $45 million of additional insurance recoveries during the quarter. This brings us to a total of $329 million in insurance recoveries to date, and of course, those cover both claims as well as associated legal costs.","Back to the table at the top, our environmental-related costs were $0.01 for the quarter and related to our whole house water program at Hinkley.","Slide 5 shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations. Our lower authorized cost of capital resulted in a reduction of $0.09 compared to Q2 of last year, and our increased shares outstanding resulted in a $0.03 reduction. These were largely offset by the absence of a scheduled nuclear refueling outage in Q2 this year, worth $0.06, and higher rate-based earnings worth $0.05 compared to Q2 of last year.","Our guidance for 2013 earnings from operations is on Slide 6, and it's unchanged at $2.55 to $2.75 per share. Some of the key assumptions underlying our guidance are provided in the appendix of this slide deck. At the bottom of the slide, you'll see our guidance for the key components of the natural gas matters in pretax dollars, and these are unchanged other than reflecting the $45 million of insurance recoveries we booked in Q2.","Regarding our equity needs, we continue to expect to need roughly $1 billion to $1.2 billion for the year based on our current accrual for potential fines. So where are we to date? During the first half of the year, we issued about $575 million, of which about $140 million was in Q2. It consisted of about $90 million through our internal programs, our 401(k) and dividend reinvestment plans, and about $50 million through our continuous equity offering or dribble program. Obviously, our financial plans are subject to change during the remainder of the year, depending largely on the resolution of the gas investigations.","Now I'm going to spend a few minutes on the numbers associated with our gas pipeline commitment and the safety division's revised recommendation. In the appendix to today's slide deck, in Exhibit 3, we've included a table that lays out the $2.2 billion that our shareholders have spent or that we committed to spend on pipeline safety since the accident. This includes unrecovered expenses and capital under our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan, as well as other gas transmission expenses outside of that program, such as integrity management, our rights-of-way work and other gas transmission safety work.","The following slide, Exhibit 4, walks you from the $2.2 billion that our shareholders have spent or committed to spend to the $4 billion that would be required under the safety division's revised recommendation. First, you need to add $300 million for the fine that they are recommending. And second, you need to add more than $1.5 billion of incremental shareholder-funded gas spending that they've recommended.","The way you get the $1.5 billion figure is you start with the safety division's headline number of $2.25 billion. In the revised recommendation, they would only give us credit for $435 million of our pipeline expenditures, so you would subtract that off. You would also subtract $300 million for their recommended fine. That would leave you with about $1.5 billion of incremental shareholder-funded gas spending. We believe this recommendation is excessive and, if approved, could increase our cost of capital, which would ultimately increase cost to our customers. S&P, for example, indicated that, if the revised recommendation were approved, it would review its assessment of California regulation and that a downward revision to their assessment could affect ratings on all companies regulated by the CPUC. Obviously, the ability to raise capital efficiently is very important, given the large investment in infrastructure we're planning so that we can continue to provide safe and reliable gas and electric service to our customers. I'll stop there, and we can now open up the lines and address your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I have more of, I guess, a regulatory question for you. And it's, I guess, the potential communication that exists between an ALJ and a commissioner on the CPUC. And in an OII, I'm getting mixed reports that there's no communication between an ALJ and a commissioner on the CPUC, even if that commissioner is in charge of the OII. I wonder if you could give some color on that.","Thomas E. Bottorff","This is Tom Bottorff. I'm responsible for regulatory affairs. Commissioners can speak with ALJs, the assigned commissioner can speak with an ALJ on a proceeding, irrespective of whether it's an investigation or a normal regulatory class [ph].","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapidis with Goldman Sachs.","I'm sorry. That question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolf Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","A couple of questions. Based on the ALJ filing last night and the timing of the comments, et cetera, could you give us a sense of when the earliest we could actually get an ALJ-proposed decision and then a final order?","Thomas E. Bottorff","Yes, this is Tom Bottorff again. Normally, this schedule would have all of the submissions concluded by a certain date, and then the judges would have 60 days from the submission of all the documents to issue a proposed order. The commission -- the judge doesn't have to use the full 60 days. So if you look at what's happened with this recent order, where they've asked for more information and the reply comment's due September 23, following those submissions, those documents, we would expect to still have the opportunity to submit our own reply to the staff's last amended reply, the brief proposal. So we probably will conclude the submission of our documents sometime in October, but that, again, depends on a schedule that hasn't been issued. But conceivably, the judges, if they have their decisions in progress, could issue them shortly after the submission of the documents, so you could see one as early as October, but it could be as late as November or December. It just depends on the schedule that they ultimately adopt, and we haven't seen that yet because they're still in the process of requesting additional information.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And then on the criminal case that Tony mentioned, could you just -- it sounded just a little bit more of a tone that you're expecting something to actually be filed, most likely. Could you just give us a little more flavor on that? And what are the potential implications if those charges are made?","Anthony F. Earley","Yes, Steve, let me start off, and [indiscernible] Can add any additional color to it. I think what we're finding is, now that the other proceedings, the civil cases and the regulatory cases, are winding down, the various prosecutors who have been involved are starting to become more active. We've had a number of meetings with them, providing them with information. As we've said all along, we're fully cooperating with them in providing information. So it's just a matter, I think, of now the timing. Those proceedings are starting to get ripe to make -- have them make a decision as to what they want to do, if anything.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","And again, just if they do file charges, where is that -- where's the implication in terms of just all the other, I guess, financial implications? Is it an insurance issue, or is there some other parts of this process where it could impact?","Anthony F. Earley","Well, there are a whole range of approaches that they could take, including a fine, which would be financial. It's hard -- we have no indication whatsoever of if they will seek that or what kind of range they would seek or whether they would look at the CPUC proceeding and say, \"The company has paid a significant amount already.\"","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","And then one other just technical question on the -- it seems like, in this whole process, there's a lot of focus on the Oberlin report. And just -- to your understanding, does the Oberlin report reflect all costs that shareholders have borne, both costs that had already been borne plus additional costs?","Kent M. Harvey","This is Kent. There was a hearing related to the Oberlin report, and it was clear at the hearing that Oberlin considered all unrecovered costs, not just fines, so including work that we did on our system that was unrecovered.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","And including costs that had been done before they did that report, too. So...","Kent M. Harvey","That was a little less clear about -- the timing was a little less clear.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. I mean, it just seems like this is getting out of control, as you mentioned, I guess, excessive. I mean, and obviously, this seems to get more and more fought in the press, so to speak. Just what are kind of the options you can do to kind of just -- I know you refiled to kind of put new testimony in. I mean, are there other options that you can do to kind of get your point made here than having to just hope for an outcome and have to appeal it or something?","Kent M. Harvey","I'd say that it's more than hoping for an outcome. It's being aggressive in our filings, and we've made it clear that we think the approach of looking at what we can afford, rather than looking at the substantial work that we've already done and taking that into account, that ought to be what they should be looking at. And remember, these are recommendations of parties and the staff. We don't even have an administrative law judge's decision yet. And then, of course, the commission has to issue a final decision. And we'll be involved, each step of the way, making our argument that the focus ought to be, \"Did the company get it? Have we changed our focus? Are we committed to safety, and are we spending money on safety?\" rather than, \"How much can they afford?\" Because we just think that is the absolute wrong focus. I don't know of any proceeding that focuses on that in the regulatory arena.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Questions on the General Rate Case processing and on the TO. First, on the General Rate Case, is there a formal timeline for when settlement talks could occur? And if not, are you looking at the rate case and saying, \"Hey, this could actually get resolved on time, unlike many of the other California rate cases over the last few years?\"","Thomas E. Bottorff","This is Tom Bottorff again. There is a formal date set aside for a settlement conference. That's August 12 and 13. So we'll have an opportunity at that point to convene with the parties. I should point out, though, that we've already settled with 3 of the parties and continue to engage in discussions to settle specific issues. So we're not necessarily waiting for the conference to resolve them. But right now, with those settlement conversations in place, the ones that are scheduled, that is all part of the schedule that had been set out by the judges when the proceedings were first initiated, and we are on schedule. So there's nothing that's occurred that would suggest there's a significant delay coming. And in fact, just the opposite. We're on schedule in every phase of the proceeding up to this point.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","The other question is on the TO case, the TO15 case that you just filed last week. Do you implement rates on an interim basis using the 10.9% ROE and then, if the decision comes back differently, you adjust or refund accordingly? Or do you expect the case to actually be litigated this quickly?","Thomas E. Bottorff","No. Generally what's happened and one of the reasons we did file for a reduction is that it allows us to put the rate into effect sooner, we're hoping as early as October 1. And that would reflect the request as we filed it. So that would include the higher return, and that's one of the reasons we submitted the application at this point -- this earlier time frame.","Kent M. Harvey","And Michael, this is Kent. I'll just add, the rates are subject to refund based on the ultimate outcome from the proceedings.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And how long do you think the actual proceeding will take?","Thomas E. Bottorff","So normally, we settle these proceedings. So we haven't actually gone to hearing on any of our TO cases as yet. So we would expect to settle it sometime by the middle of next year.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. So you'll put in rates with the higher authorized return in it and then settle mid-next -- sometimes second quarter, third quarter-ish next year, and any adjustment subject to refund.","Thomas E. Bottorff","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Andrew Gay - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","This is actually Andrew Gay. Just procedurally, is it your view that yesterday's ALJ request settles the scheduling issue in the docket? Or will you still ask for the ability to respond to the CPSD corrections letter in line with your original request for an extension to the schedule?","Thomas E. Bottorff","This is Tom Bottorff. We still have our motion pending to reopen the proceeding. That's still undecided. We expect a ruling on that. And in any event, once that decision is issued and once the responses to the recent questions are answered, we still have our opportunity to file a reply to the amended proposal the staff issued on July 16. So those opportunities still exist, and that's why there's some uncertainty in the schedule if the judge has yet to rule on our motion and has yet to decide the new date for us to respond to the staff's July 16 proposal.","Andrew Gay - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then, in terms of the ALJ ruling, they mentioned -- I'm sorry, the ALJ request, they mentioned in there that they thought the $2.25 billion from the Oberlin report was incremental equity. Should we read anything into that, or how should we think about the interpretation of that $2.25 billion?","Kent M. Harvey","This is Kent. I think that term is used to describe the way Oberlin approached it, which was how much equity can be raised in addition to the expected amount of equity needed just to support our normal ongoing capital expenditure program and other needs.","Andrew Gay - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So not necessarily relating to whether it was from this point forward or whether it's aggregate, is that...","Kent M. Harvey","It's really to address the equity needs associated with the gas pipeline cost and the proceeding as compared to the rest of our equity needs associated with our core business.","Andrew Gay - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then finally, can you give an update on the processes -- on the process to address net metering issues and then also the rate hearing legislation?","Thomas E. Bottorff","This is Tom Bottorff again. What we have pending on the rate issues, the tier reform issue is being addressed in legislature and through a proceeding at the PUC, a general rule-making on how residential rates should be set going forward. They're both in process. The legislation is pending in Sacramento, and the proceeding is still ongoing on how rates should be set for the future, generally, on time of use versus tier reform or some other kind of tier reduction. So we expect a decision on the PUC proceeding by the end of the year. We would also expect to see some action on the legislation before the end of the year as well. Net metering has not been formally introduced in either of those forums. But certainly, the effect -- any effect on the change in rates may have an effect on how net metering is calculated. But there's no formal proceeding as to address changes in the net metering prices.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have a follow-up question from Steve Fleishman with Wolf Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","I might have missed this, but in the new TO filing, what is the requested ROE now versus what you got, the 9.1% that you got the last time?","Kent M. Harvey","Steve, this is Kent. We requested 10.9%, and that includes a 50 basis point outer.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","And you're able that book at the 10.9% as of October, unless they ask you to change it again?","Kent M. Harvey","That would be correct. Assuming that they would put rates into effect at that time.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And just, I mean, besides the delay caused by this ALJ filing last night, could you just maybe give a little more color on how to think about the types of questions that are being asked in this filing and commentary?","Anthony F. Earley","It's hard to speculate. I mean, what I said before, I think, is true, that the focus has -- seems to be on this affordability issue. Our hope, and we will continue to urge the commission to keep this in mind, is that's the wrong question. And it's not a question that I see used in other regulatory proceedings. The real question is what's appropriate, given the facts of the San Bruno explosion, and also what's necessary to make sure that the company is working on the right thing. I don't think anyone can question we're working on the right things. We've heard that time and again. There's no question that we're spending significant resources on working on the right thing. So I think we just have to get the focus back to the right questions rather than focus on this affordability issue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It's actually Rajeev Lalwani. Just a follow-up on San Bruno. As you go through the next few months and you look at an ALJ recommendation and a final decision, is it going -- do you think it's going to follow the path of a rate case, where you get less and less extreme views as you go through the process? Or are you in kind of new territory and not sure where it goes?","Anthony F. Earley","We really can't speculate on that. That's what we will be urging, that the commissioners will take a reasoned view of this. But it's hard to, right now, say where we're going to go. We'll continue to push for focusing on what we think are the right questions.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And let's say you get a kind of an extreme recommendation like the CPSD had, but if that's the final decision, what's the process after that to appeal, et cetera?","Anthony F. Earley","Well, these decisions of the CPUC can be appealed to the courts. Obviously, that's not a direction we want to go. We want to get these proceedings done and behind us, which, I think, all of you have expressed the opinion that, that's what you'd like to see. Obviously, the safety valve is -- if the number is too high, if the credit we get for what we spent already is too low, we'd have to look at our ability to deal with it, but that's kind of a last resort. We want to go try and get the decision to where it's something we can live with going forward and focus on the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just 2 quick follow-ups. I want to know what exactly is the record right now in the proceeding. Does the record include the, like, original recommendations that the CPSD and, say, the city of San Bruno made and the revised ones? Or does it just include the revised recommendations? And the second question is just, when I think of all the recommendations that've come out, they've all revolved around that Oberlin report number of like $2.25 billion. Is that just a mile marker that everyone's using, or legally, they all have to come back to that number?","Thomas E. Bottorff","It's Tom Bottorff. There's no requirement that the judges adopt the $2.25 billion number. That simply seems to be a framework that each of the parties have built their recommendation around. So it still remains to be seen whether the judge adopts that, and if so, what dollars that we've spent are credited against that $2.25 billion number. So we'll just have to wait and see what ultimately comes out in the judge's decision. And with respect to the question about the proposals that are in the record, all of the proposals that have been filed remained in the record. The only one that's really been revised significantly is the staff's recommendation, and that takes the place of what they originally thought.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fallon with SIR Capital Management.","Kevin Fallon","I just wanted to follow up on Anthony's question a little bit. What kind of latitude did the ALJs have in terms of crafting a proposal here? In particular, are they able to do things like give you relief from keeping your 48% -- or your equity ratio as a utility, so you wouldn't have to issue as much equity up front? Are they allowed to do things like that?","Thomas E. Bottorff","I don't know to what extent they would have enough information to make a recommendation on that. They certainly have a lot of discretion on how they decide what penalty amount is appropriate, what the basis for the penalty is. So it could be quite different from the proposals that you've seen presented up to this point, but I don't know to what extent they would specifically address the equity issue.","Kevin Fallon","But they have that kind of latitude, there's really very little to limit them, not just on the equity ratio in terms of levels and fines and what's sort of are included?","Kent M. Harvey","This is Kent Harvey. I would just add, the equity ratio was recently resolved in the cost of capital decision. And that's the proceeding through which the commission determines what's an appropriate capital structure. So I think it's less likely that it would reconsidered in a penalty proceeding.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","It's actually John Cohen. So in reading the ALJ filing, it seems to me that what the ALJ is trying to draw out is a distinction between pretax and posttax dollars. And obviously, any equity raised would cover aftertax expenses, which I guess you could gross up to get a pretax number. So if we're looking at something where the ALJ allows you to deduct all of the shareholder-borne expenses but uses a posttax number for that $2.25 billion, how do you think that would compare to what the current CPSD revised recommendation is? Because when we look at it, it looks like you almost got to the same place under those methodologies.","Anthony F. Earley","Yes. We'd have to look at the numbers. And I think one thing we've seen from all the parties is that people have been very creative in terms of how they've actually applied numbers in this proceeding. So we want to go through that and address that appropriately through the proceeding.","Operator","There are currently no additional questions.","Gabriel B. Togneri","All right. In that case, I'll thank everybody for their participation and hope you have a good day. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for attending the PG&E Corporation second quarter earnings 2013 conference call. This will now conclude the conference.

Our comments today will include forward-looking statements based on assumptions and expectations reflecting information currently available to management. Some of the important factors that could affect our results are described at the front of today's slide. We also encourage you to review the more fulsome discussion of risk factors that appear in our 2011 annual report that will be filed as an exhibit to the Form 10-K with the SEC later today. ","This morning's speakers are Tony Earley, Chris Johns, Nick Stavropoulos and Kent Harvey. Other members of the team are also here to participate in the Q&A. And with that, I'll hand it over to Tony.","Anthony F. Earley","Thank you, Gabe, and thank you all for listening in today. Since this is only my second quarterly earnings call, I think I'm still enough of a newcomer to share some of my observations of the company before we get to the heart of our discussion this morning.","At our last earnings call, I made several points about what we had done to start to transform PG&E. And we had hired a lot of top-tier talent to supplement the strong core of PG&E veterans that we have. We made organizational changes that established clear lines of accountability for our gas and electric businesses. We put a strong emphasis on operational excellence, and we made a commitment of resources to turn the business around, and, ultimately, to make our operations the safest in the country. So with the benefits of a few more months on the job, let me add a couple more observations.","Our team understands that public safety is our highest priority, and we're now rolling out technologies to get us there. They understand that the focus is on back-to-basics, that we have to be -- have to focus on benchmarking and to put in place a continuous improvement program. Most of all, the team understands that we have to deliver. We know the areas we need to improve on, and we've got a solid foundation from which we can execute. And that's significant because it means that in contrast to where we were just 7 or 8 months ago, we now have a very real opportunity in 2012: first, to truly tackle and resolve our gas issues; second, focus on repositioning PG&E for long-term success; and third, rebuild relationships with key stakeholders. And that is exactly what our executive team is focused on.","So let me start with the first point, the gas issues. The new gas organization we put in place last year has delivered on our key commitments and made impressive progress in 2011. And Chris and Nick will give you the update on the details in just a couple of minutes. What you'll hear is that we still got an extremely demanding amount of work ahead in 2012. Much of this falls under our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan. It's work that is critical to meeting the new pipeline safety standards being adopted by the CPUC and in Congress. It's also essential to resolving the San Bruno issues and rebuilding public trust and confidence in the company. At the same time, it's important to distinguish between the work that was necessary to close the gaps in our past performance and work that's newly required going forward.","Our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan is largely new work for a new world, where the CPUC is setting future safety standards at a higher level than ever before. With minor exceptions, it's not all work to meet yesterday's standards as some have claimed. To avoid confusion, we've already asked the CPUC to separate the review of the appropriateness of the plan over the issue of who should pay for the plan.","You've seen our press release this morning that although we're maintaining our guidance from earnings from operations, we've updated our outlook for 2012 pipeline costs. The update reflects our current understanding of our cost based on the experience that we gained in the field last year. We've also made some conservative assumptions about the timing of the CPUC's ruling on our safety plan. Let me underscore that we're going to continue to work hard to accelerate a decision on a safety plan and to resolve all of the gas-related proceedings at the commission.","Reaching as much clarity and closure as we can on the regulatory and legal fronts in doing so as soon as we can is a top priority for our team, and we know it's a top priority for our investors as well. Shareholders have stepped up and are bearing substantial cost to address past issues, and it's important that regulators recognize this when it comes time to make a decision on cost for work going forward, and we will urge them to take that into account.","Let me turn briefly to positioning the company for long-term success. Success, for us, is delivering overall results for customers that are in the first quartile. The key is honestly assessing our business, benchmarking our performance and then acting to close any gaps that we find. We're going to ingrain this into our operations and our culture. Focusing on operational excellence is the single best way to rebuild our relationships with customers, regulators and, we believe, investors. As you've heard me say before based on my past experience in similar situations, the only way to convince customers that you're a different company is to prove it by listening to them and then delivering great service. And our entire executive team understands this. None of us expects to get there overnight, but we've set a high bar, and we will make significant progress in 2012.","So with that, I'll turn to Chris and then Nick to take you through our operational progress in 2011 and our plans for the coming year. Chris?","Christopher P. Johns","Thanks, Tony. Today, I'm going to summarize the significant work that we completed in 2011 to help resolve the gas pipeline issues. And I'll touch on the work that we're doing to position the broader company for success. I'll also discuss some of the regulatory developments over the last couple of months.","Let me start with the gas work in 2011. We accomplished a remarkable amount of work this past year to improve the safety of our gas pipeline system. To give you just a couple of examples, by the end of January, we have validated the maximum allowable operating pressures, or what we refer to as MAOP, for all of the more than 2,000 miles of transmission pipelines in high consequence areas. And along the way, we met every one of our commitments with our regulators. In the process, we conducted a records validation effort more detailed and comprehensive than anything done before anywhere. We've completed an unprecedented amount of pressure testing, validating the safety of over 160 miles of gas transmission pipe. This was technically difficult and highly complex work on in-service pipes in densely populated areas. And as Nick will discuss later, we'll be doing a similar amount of work this year to further validate and enhance the safety of our system.","Now gas operations in place, we're not the only ones working hard to improve the safety and reliability of our operations last year. We made a number of safety enhancements to our electric system, focusing on reducing the risk from outages and reducing the number of, and the impact from, equipment failures. At the same time, we had another strong year in electric reliability, where we had our second consecutive year with the new low of outage frequency.","In the area of renewables, 19.3% of the electric power we delivered in 2011 came from renewable resources, putting us on track to meet the interim benchmarks as we move towards California's 33% goal by 2020. This is in addition to the 40% of clean energy sources from our vast hydroelectric system and our nuclear facility.","Speaking of which, we had another very successful year of nuclear operations at Diablo Canyon, including in the industry-leading safety performance during our refueling outage. Finally, we installed 1.5 million SmartMeters in 2011, bringing our total to 8.9 million out of the planned 9.7 million. And we're utilizing those meters and the capabilities to reduce our outage times.","As we look into 2012, we will continue to drive our safety performance improvement in all areas of the company. And Nick's going to discuss the gas plants in just a few minutes. But in the electric operations, we'll be doing more reinforcement and inspection work on poles and increasing our overhead and underground line maintenance work in an effort to identify and resolve potential issues before they disrupt our customers or cause unsafe situations.  Throughout the business, we'll continue to work on improving our processes and using technology to achieve our safety and reliability objectives.","Finally, I'd like to discuss regulatory developments, which affect our operational outlook and plans. As you know, the CPUC initiated 2 new investigations since our last earnings call. So we're now working through 3 gas-related investigations, as well as the rule-making proceeding. You may recall that the original investigation was initiated in early 2011, focused mainly on our records management. Then in November, the CPUC initiated the class location investigation to review whether we operated our pipeline system at pressures consistent with current class designations. We've provided our responses in that proceeding, identifying our errors and properly designating class location and adjusted operating pressures accordingly.","The most recent investigation, the gas pipeline investigation, covers all areas of our pipeline operations. It takes into account a report by the safety division on the company's gas pipeline operations and practices, which the report attempts to broadly connect with the San Bruno pipeline rupture. This is the most comprehensive review of operations by the CPUC leading to a penalty proceeding.","In addition to these investigations, the CPUC in December gave the staff new citation authority in their oversight of gas companies. Through that new authority, the safety division staff issued a citation for about $17 million for our self report of some maps missing from our distribution leak survey schedule, which our team identified and then promptly corrected. We believe this fine is excessive under the circumstances, and we have appealed the citation. However, there are no precedents to rely on here, so we can't predict the final outcome.","Given all of these recent developments and considering the CPUC's wide discretion in these matters, the magnitude of the San Bruno event and developments such as the citation issued by the safety division, we've taken a charge for $200 million. This is an estimate, and it does require a lot of judgment, but we believe this represents the low end of the range of expected fines and penalties associated with the various gas matters.","Meanwhile, in the rule-making proceeding, there's been no action or progress on our request for a memo account, and the procedural schedule beyond the March hearings remains unclear. We previously assumed that we'd be able to recover the cost for work we do related to the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan in 2012 to comply with the new standards. But that is now much less likely before the rule-making proceeding is resolved. To be conservative for guidance purposes, we now assume resolution will not occur until the end of this year. This means that costs incurred during 2012 related to the safety plan, and prior to a final CPUC order, will fall to the bottom line. This obviously has implications for our guidance, which Kent will discuss in just a few minutes. But before we go to Kent, Nick is going to provide more detail about our gas safety plans in 2012. Nick?","Nickolas Stavropoulos","Thanks, Chris. As Chris told you, we've completed a lot of gas work this last year, but we've also been building a strong team of experts from both within the company and from industry-leading firms across the country. As we go forward, we'll be making additional progress in gas operations, including improving our integrity management program, our gas distribution practices and the use of technology, all designed to enhance public safety. We know a lot more about our gas pipeline system than we did a year ago. And we've also uncovered new challenges even during this past quarter. Based upon all of our experiences last year, we've adjusted our operational plans and our cost expectations for this year.","In terms of the scope of work for this year, we plan on pressure testing or verifying records for 185 miles of transmission pipe, replacing about 40 miles and upgrading 78 miles to enable in-line inspections on those segments. Also, by early 2013, we will complete the MAOP validation for all remaining transmission pipelines in the system, more than 4,000 additional miles. We now expect our costs for the pipeline-related work in 2012 to be about $120 million higher than we previously estimated.","The main driver is the cost for the Hydrostatic Pressure Testing program. As a reminder, we filed our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan last summer, including estimated costs, which were based upon our limited experience up to that point. We completed the majority of our 2011 pressure testing since that time, which impacted our cost expectations for this year. Based upon what we experienced last year in the pressure testing program, we expect to continue to incur cost per mile much higher than what you might see from some of our industry peers. And there are a couple of reasons for this: first, industry average cost for pressure testing are generally based upon long line pipe of uniform size with minimal population or customer impacts. We, on the other hand, need to conduct test on shorter segments of older pipes, often in densely populated areas. And second, we face challenges in local permitting and environmental activities like water disposal, and we expect these to continue as we focus our program on more pipelines in the San Francisco Bay Area this year.","So while additional lead time allows us to bid and contract for these projects more strategically, which will lower these costs compared to 2011, we still expect our pressure testing cost to be substantially more than the industry average. Although the pressure testing unit costs are by far the biggest driver of our higher estimates this year, we'll also need to complete work on some pipelines that we had not originally planned to address in 2012. This carryover work will also increase our pipeline expenses. The combination of all the work I've described in our ongoing performance improvement efforts should bring us greater certainty in higher performance in our gas business going forward.","Now I'll turn things over to Kent.","Kent M. Harvey","Good morning. I have a fair amount to cover, so I'd like to provide the big picture before I go through all the details. And I think there are 5 key takeaways: first, we took a $200 million of accrual in Q4 for potential penalties associated with all the gas matters; second, our other Q4 results were in line with guidance; third, we're maintaining our 2012 guidance for earnings from operations at $3.10 to $3.30 per share; fourth, we're modifying our 2012 guidance for pipeline-related costs; and fifth, we're increasing our estimate of 2012 equity needs. I'll explain each of these as I go through with my remarks.","So I'm going to start with our Q4 results, which are summarized on Slide 6. Here you can see that earnings from operations for Q4 were $366 million or $0.89 per share, and earnings for operations from the year totaled $3.58 per share.","GAAP earnings for the quarter were $83 million or $0.20 per share. The difference between Q4 earnings from operations and GAAP earnings is the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters. And the details of that are shown in the table at the bottom of the slide. First is the pipeline-related costs, which totaled $180 million pretax during the quarter. And this includes the strength testing and the pipeline validation work that Chris and Nick talked about, as well as our legal and other costs that we incurred during the quarter. For the year, this totaled $483 million pretax and was in line with our guidance.","Below that, you see the $200 million accrual we took in Q4 for potential penalties stemming from the various gas matters. As you know, this was an item we had not provided guidance on. Chris described the regulatory developments that occurred since our last call and some of the factors we considered in determining the amount of the accrual, which clearly involved a lot of judgment. Obviously, we'll continue to assess the accrual in future quarters until the issues are resolved.","Next, you can see that there were no additional accruals during the quarter for third-party liabilities. Prior to Q4, we had accrued a cumulative $375 million through a third-party liability, including $155 million in 2011, which you see on the right. And finally, you can see that we booked additional insurance recoveries of $39 million related to third-party claims during Q4. That brings us to $99 million of insurance recoveries since the accident, and we'll continue to wait until we've resolved claims with each carrier before booking additional insurance recoveries.","Slide 7 has the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations. The $0.89 earned in the fourth quarter, which is shown on the far right, represents a $0.19 increase compared to Q4 of 2010. You see, the $0.02 of that is due to higher authorized rate base investment. And then we also incurred costs for 2 items in Q4 of 2010 that we did not have in Q4 of 2011, $0.06 for a nuclear refueling outage and $0.05 related to the SmartMeter program.","Litigation and regulatory matters also was $0.04 favorable compared to Q4 2010, in part because the prior period included an initial accrual for the Rancho Cordova accident. These increases were partly offset by higher shares outstanding, which had a $0.03 impact and miscellaneous items totaling about $0.04 negative, including some employee related costs such as severance and workers' comp.","That completes my summary of our 2011 results. So I'm now going to move on to our outlook for 2012. On Slide 8, you can see that our guidance for 2012 earnings from operations remains at $3.10 to $3.30 per share. As I'll cover in a moment, we do expect additional equity issuance this year, which will result in some dilution. However, notwithstanding that, we're maintaining our 2012 guidance for EPS from operations at $3.10 to $3.30 per share. I'll remind you also that in the last quarter's call, we provided some of the key assumptions underlying our 2012 guidance, including authorized rate base, CapEx spending levels, incremental expenses we expect to incur and authorized ROE and cap structure. And that info is again included on a slide in the appendix.","Back to Slide 8, there also was no change in our 2012 guidance related to our item impacting comparability for environmental-related costs. This is in connection with chromium cleanup and mitigation at Hinkley. However, we are updating our guidance for the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters. And if you turn to Slide 9, I'll walk you through the changes.","Starting on the left-hand side of the slide, you'll remember that our 2012 gas pipeline-related work includes the work we proposed in our pipeline safety enhancement plan, which was originally estimated to cost about $230 million, as well as work that fell outside the PSEP, which we estimated would cost between $100 million and $200 million. The non-PSEP costs included work on post-1970 pipe, as well as litigation and other costs.","Previously, the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan work was excluded from our 2012 guidance for the item impacting comparability because we assumed approval of the PSEP as filed. So as you can see at the bottom on the left, our item impacting comparability included only the non-PSEP work, which as you know, we weren't seeking recovery of.","At the upper right side of the slide, you can see the updated cost estimate for our 2012 pipeline work, which is increased by about $120 million for the reasons Nick described. Remember, the original PSEP cost estimates were down last summer prior to a lot of our experience in the field. Our estimate now reflects that experience.","In addition, our outlook for the PSEP recovery has also changed. Since our last call, we haven't seen progress in approving a memo account for cost we incur pending a final decision, and the procedural schedule for a final decision is still unclear beyond hearings scheduled in March. We've decided to conservatively assume that the PSEP is not resolved by the commission until the end of this year. Therefore, we're now including our PSEP and non-PSEP costs in our 2012 guidance for the item impacting comparability. The updated guidance range for these costs is $450 million to $550 million.","On Slide 10, you can see a summary of our current 2012 guidance. As I mentioned before, there's no change in guidance for EPS from operations or for our environmental-related costs. The natural gas matters item is broken out in the table below into its components, including the pipeline-related costs I just described. The range for third-party liability claims remains unchanged at 0 to $225 million. This range reflects the difference between the amount we've accrued to date, $375 million, and the upper end of our estimate for third-party liability, which is $600 million. As has been our practice, we're not providing guidance for additional penalties beyond what we've already accrued, or for future insurance recoveries.","I'm going to finish with an update on our equity issuance in 2011 and our plans for 2012, and that's on Slide 11. On our last call, we estimated that based on our guidance assumptions at the time, we expected to issue roughly $600 million of equity starting in the fourth quarter of 2011 through the end of 2012. And you can see that on the left.","Next to that, you can see we actually issued $276 million of equity in Q4. Of course, our guidance now assumes higher unrecovered costs for our gas pipeline-related work in 2012. And in Q4, we took the $200 million accrual for gas-related penalties. Both of these factors have contributed to an expected increase in our 2012 equity issuance of about $300 million. As a result, we expect our 2012 equity needs to be roughly in the $600 million range based on our current assumptions. Obviously, our actual issuance during the year is going to depend on the resolution of the gas matters as well as other factors.","We'd expect to issue between $150 million and $250 million through our internal programs, the 401(k) and DRIP, with the balance coming from external issuance. Our existing dribble program has about $300 million of remaining capacity, and we'll consider another dribble program as well as other alternatives to address any remaining needs during the year.","That completes our prepared remarks for this morning's call. And so we'll go ahead now and open up the lines for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Kent, I'm just kind of following up on where you finished off your conversation with the $200 million fine accrual in your numbers in the fourth quarter. What could cause that number to change up or down other than some sort of definitive agreement or some sort of fine out of the commission where that could move over the course of the year?","Kent M. Harvey","Well, Dan, the $200 million that we talked about, obviously, involved a lot of judgment. And every quarter, we'll continue to monitor the overall situation and all the factors that Chris described. And we need to be confident at the end of each quarter that our accrual accurately represents the lower end of a reasonable range.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And so then you would adjust -- if that number were to move up and the equity number would go up in step with that, is that the right way to think about the kind of the one-for-one as you accrue against an equity need?","Kent M. Harvey","Yes. The only thing I would say maybe to just refine on that a little bit is in the case of our accrual that we took in the fourth quarter, obviously, that's a non-cash accrual at this point. And depending upon the resolution of the gas matters, at some point, it will become a cash item. While it's a non-cash accrual, it's not 100% you fund with equity because, obviously, you're raising cash, which otherwise you don't need at this point when you issue the equity. So in some ways, you end up initially raising roughly half of what you need and displacing debt issuance that you otherwise would have needed. Ultimately, when you pay a cash amount for the item, then we would raise the remaining equity and some a little bit of debt to offset what you displaced initially, and that becomes one-for-one eventually.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, and I guess just, Tony, I know you spend a lot of time trying to focus on the benchmarking work. Can you just kind of talk to us a little bit now that you have some metrics in place, where you see the businesses ranking out against your benchmarks today? And then what kind of deliverables you promised or committed to the board over the '12 and '13 timeframe to get to get improvement up to kind of meet the goals you want to have.","Anthony F. Earley","I think what the benchmarking has told us is there are some areas that we have made some real progress. And as Chris mentioned, some of our reliability numbers on the electric system, we've seen some tremendous improvements. We've also seen some very nice improvements in things like OSHA recordables on safety, although we still have some issues we've got to work on in terms of serious injuries and fatalities at the company. And we've committed to our board to move those along. Clearly, on some of the perceptual benchmarkings, so our customer satisfaction numbers, which combines not only our operational performance but also the perception of the company in the marketplace, those continue to reside squarely in third and fourth quartile. And to deal with those, you've got to do a combination of improving the service and also in improving the credibility of the company in the marketplace. That's why some of the work that Nick and his team has done this past year on the hydrotesting in the MAOP, we're starting to get some recognition. And we really have committed to having the safest gas system. And I think eventually, people will start to realize it's a very real commitment that we're delivering on. So I would say while there are some areas we've made some real progress, we continue on some of our operational areas that affect our customer satisfaction numbers and the like. We're still average to below average.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then what is your commitment to the board as far as making improvements over the course of '12 or '13? Is there numbers we should be looking at to gauge success?","Anthony F. Earley","Well, our long-term target is to have everything in the first quartile. There's some things like safety we want to be top decile. My commitment to the board is we will show significant progress in 2012.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Tony, I just want to go back to your comments from the beginning of the call. I just want to be clear in my understanding that you feel very strongly that the commission, from a legal precedent perspective, needs to differentiate prudently incurred costs associated with new mandates and allow their recovery as it compares to the cost that you've already incurred and will incur in 2012 on sort of catching up with old mandates. Is that a fair regurgitation of your statement?","Anthony F. Earley","That is absolutely fair. And as I said, there's a lot of confusion because in the proceeding around our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan, there seemed to be more discussion from some the parties around the issue of who pays rather than -- whether the scope of the plan is the right scope and that we're working on the right things to make this the safest system that we can make it. So we did file a request to separate those 2 issues. We'll have to see what the commission does with it. But we're making it very clear, you do have to separate those 2 issues.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So when I look at Slide 9 of your presentation, which goes through the increase in the costs, your non-PSEP cost estimate previously was $100 million to $200 million. Is the full $120 million increase associated with non-PSEP-related costs?","Kent M. Harvey","This is Kent. I would say that the majority of that amount is associated with non-PSEP costs. And if you think about it in the PSEP, we had originally proposed work on pipe that was from 1961 to 1970, that timeframe. And we have since agreed that, that should be outside of the scope of the PSEP. So while the cost of the hydrostatic testing both in and outside the program has gone up, the increase within the program is somewhat mitigated by the fact that we've reduced some scope within the program and moved it outside. So most of the overall impact will be on the non-PSEP side.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So basically, the underlying tenet here is that PSEP costs, to the extent they're deemed to be in line with new regulation, should be recoverable. Non-PSEP costs are on the shareholders.","Kent M. Harvey","That's correct.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. One more question on that line. In reading the turn in the DRA testimony, they were very critical of a lot of things, frankly. But they were very critical of the cost estimates for doing certain types of work, including hydrostatic testing, and that they cited their experts indicating that they thought you could do it for less, and here you are increasing the estimate of how much it's going to cost. Can you speak to why there's such a wide difference of opinion on what the right cost is to complete this work?","Anthony F. Earley","Let me start off, and then I'll turn it over to Nick to get into the details. So having built pipelines like the Millennium Pipeline, Iroquois Pipeline, when you're going out doing hydrostatic testing on a brand-new pipeline and you've got the pipe lying there in the trench, you know where you're going to do the hydrostatic testing in advance. It's all laid out, and it's a relatively simple process. We're doing hydrostatic testing on pipe that's been in the ground for 50, 60 years that neighborhoods have grown up around, streets have been paved over. It is a major project. The other issue that we discovered was when you put a brand-new pipe in the ground, you fill it with water, you pressure test it, the water comes out clean. When you put water in a pipe that's been around for 50 or 60 years, you've got residual hydrocarbons, you got corrosion products in there, and we've had to then spend a huge amount of money treating the water coming out, out of the pipes. So Nick and his team have been working very hard to simplify the process. But, Nick, there still is a lot of challenge out there.","Nickolas Stavropoulos","Yes, Tony. I think it's fair to say the work that we did this past year and that we're going to do in 2012 regarding hydrostatic testing is probably the most complex hydrostatic testing program anywhere in the United States. And as Tony alluded that these are shorter segments of older pipelines, very difficult working conditions to be able to stage the equipment at the point where you need to begin and then stage additional equipment at the end of the test. And the environmental requirements here in California are appropriately the most rigorous in the country. So those standards that we are adhering to here are the highest bar, no doubt, and drive a lot of these costs. And the majority of the cost that we incurred that were unanticipated really relate to handling the water in the hydro test program, where we need to, in many cases before we begin our hydro test, flush these lines to make sure that the water in the pipe when we do the hydro test, the actual test itself, is up to drinking water standards. So that has required us to do a lot of water handling, a lot of water treatment, a lot of water disposal, way over and above what would be required, as Tony indicated, in a new pipeline. That said, over the course of 2011, our cost per mile was around $1.6 million a mile. Our estimate for this year is somewhere in the $1.1 million, $1.15 million per mile. So a significant reduction of what we incurred in 2011. I would also add that we're dealing with shorter segments of pipe than I think that most people do, and so that adds to the cost per mile.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just to go to the penalty stuff, how should we think about how you guys go about sort of -- I know there's a lot of judgment involved, but sort of how do you go about, sort of, estimating what you think they might be? I mean, is this based on discussions? Or just how do we get a feel for that process?","Anthony F. Earley","Let me start, and then I'll flip it over to Kent. And just to clarify that what we accrued is not what we thought it might be. It is the low end. And you get to there as we've looked at all the developments that we concluded having no accrual at all was not the appropriate place to be. Because I think it was certain we going to have a penalty. And in looking at all the facts and circumstances and using judgment, concluded that $200 million -- we didn't think that the penalty would, in any realistic circumstance, be below $200 million. Now there are a lot of facts that went into that. Kent, you might want to comment on just some of the things you look at. But I want to make sure that's what we think the minimum is it's not what we think, the best guess of what it's going to be.","Kent M. Harvey","Paul, Tony's overall summary is exactly right. And the things we looked at with the various proceedings at the commission including -- we looked at that CPSD's report that was filed early in the year. We looked at the new OII in San Bruno that was issued January and also the citation from the CPSD related to the maps that Chris covered earlier. And the reality of the situation, when you look at all the different issues, is that there are no clear precedents, really. And there's not just like a formula that can be applied to the situation. But all the indications are that the PUC will impose a large penalty here. So we considered previous penalties, such as Rancho Cordova. And then we tried to take into account the magnitude of this event, and we determined overall that the penalty will likely be higher than anything that's been previously issued by the PUC for all of those reasons. And we ended up thinking that $200 million was a reasonable estimate for the low end of the range of possible outcomes.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, and then also, there was, a week or 2 ago, some articles regarding welders saying that the hydrostatic testing wasn't perhaps as good as it could have been or it was -- I'm just wondering, I know that it's been pretty recent since this came out, but just do you guys have any thought processes as to what they're talking about or the validity of it?","Nickolas Stavropoulos","Well, this is Nick. We take every communication that comes into us concerning questions about whether or not we accomplish work properly very seriously. And so we took a look at what these 2 welders had to say, and we've gone back and made an intensive records review. We've pulled all the radiographic welding records and all of the asphalt material. We have looked at this every way we possibly can, and we find absolutely no merit whatsoever into the allegations that have been brought forth by these 2 folks. I can't speak to their motivations, but we take everything like this very seriously, and we have found nothing to suggest that our workmanship was nothing but top quality. That's another thing going back to the cost of these hydrostatic testing program. We have put in an extraordinarily extensive QA QC program way beyond what industry standards are to make sure that this work is done property, and that certainly adds to the cost, to the time of execution. But we find absolutely no indication whatsoever that we had any issues with our testing last year.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","On the -- just to be sure I understand the PSEP number and how it's impacted guidance, is the situation that, that $230 million before was kind of neither in your operating guidance nor in the GAAP guidance because you were assuming recovery? And all this really happening, is it now -- it's in the GAAP guidance, having been a net 0 before effectively?","Kent M. Harvey","Jonathan, that's right. Essentially, we said last quarter that we were assuming full recovery of the PSEP cost, so that they wouldn't flow through the bottom line. Although I remember, sort of, talking through the fact that there could be a timing. Once you have a memo account in place, there'd be a timing about when we get a final decision, but that the cost would be recoverable. And we left it up to you guys if you wanted to make different assumptions.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So now if you were to get a memo account sometime mid-year and some of those costs will end up being recovered, that would just reduce the amount of charge to the GAAP earnings.","Kent M. Harvey","That's correct.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on -- just on the time -- you obviously put the slide out with the regulatory calendar. Just the way you've laid it out, it's sort of tempting to imagine that some of these hearings and proceedings could come to a head at more or less the same time. Am I reading too much into that? One. And two, what chances do you see that there would be some kind of merging of any of these proceedings at the commission? And I guess the third strand of that, would you need to see that in order to be able to potentially settle any of these?","Thomas E. Bottorff","Jonathan, this is Tom Bottorff, responsible for regulatory relations. I don't foresee the commission consolidating the 3 investigations at this point. But that doesn't preclude the parties of the proceedings from engaging in settlement discussions in connection with each of the investigations.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Have you -- is that something that's essentially happened already? Or is it a little too early in the game for that?","Thomas E. Bottorff","I think it's early in the game. Although the judge at the pre-hearing conference, which was held this Tuesday in the San Bruno investigation, they strongly encouraged parties to agree on issues where they could and actually offered himself up as a potential mediator to help facilitate some discussions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of questions. First, if you add the penalty accrual, the PSEP now being, kind of, rolling through as well as this additional $120 million, altogether, that's a lot less than the -- a lot more than the additional equity issuance. Is the difference just the -- this penalty issue that you're not actually having to spend the money yet, when you add all those up, I think you'll probably get $500 million, $600 million of additional hit to the balance sheet.","Kent M. Harvey","Yes, Steve, this is Kent. It is that in that -- that's why I elaborated a little on that issue earlier that it's not as simple as saying you accrue $200 million and you immediately issue $200 million. We actually, as you know, have to actively manage our capital structure, and we do, really, monthly forecasting to do that. And so you really do have to consider both when you book things and, therefore, affect your retained earnings, but also when the cash goes out the door. And that does affect that, as well as you want to think about the expenditures that are now going to be unrecovered for gas pipeline matters occurring throughout the year rather than all at the beginning of the year. And as a result, that tends to also affect the timing of the equity issuance.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Second question is just if you now take this update and go back to the beginning of the San Bruno, what is the total cost that shareholders have now borne?","Kent M. Harvey","Steve, we can easily now get up to costs that are well in excess of $1.5 billion, and I'll just kind of recap them. You saw in our press release that cumulative to date, we've spent around $550 million that is not going to be recovered, that is at a shareholder cost. And obviously, our guidance indicates that we could spend nearly that much in 2012 on pipeline-related items. We accrued a $200 million penalty. So when you add all that up, that brings you to about $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion that shareholders have incurred. As you know, we've also committed to spend $200 million this year and $200 million next year on all of our operations, which is not going to be funded by customers, but in fact at shareholders' cost. And that's how you can get to $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, which, obviously, is a very significant price tag. In fact, that's actually approaching the total net investment in our pipelines that we built up over decades. And I would also say that this business typically is authorized to earn about $100 million a year. So the cost here that shareholders have now incurred represents 15 to 20 years of earnings, basically.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. One last question. There was the testimony on the San Bruno OII that, I guess, that audits, so to speak, talked about underspending and over-earnings over a long period of time, at least alleged that. Could you just go through, kind of -- my sense is some of those issues you might not exactly agree with. Could you go through some of the issues in that analysis?","Christopher P. Johns","Yes, this is Chris. There's a couple of things that you have to take into consideration when you look at that. First of all is that for the most part, most of our gas transmission rate cases were settled. So there were settlement agreements. And when you have a settlement agreement, you don't necessarily do a line item by line item tracking of the different types of costs. And in a lot of times, you also don't address how costs are allocated between years. And so there's a lot of judgment that goes into trying to determine what were the authorized amounts of cost to be spent in any one of those given years. And so when you go back and look at the findings or the assertions, if you will, in that audit, you can see that there's a lot of different assumptions that they're making that, quite frankly, we disagree with. And that -- and we will dispute as we move forward in the process. ","The second thing, though, that you really need to focus here on is that the majority of the costs that they're alleging that we did not spend, the $400 million out of the $500 million, relates to the programs that are, quite frankly, at-risk programs, and it generally is around our gas storage and our ability to utilize those funds. Many years ago, the CPUC decided that they did not want the customers to have the risks around that, and so we were  -- the shareholders then were the ones that would suffer the consequences of a marketplace that didn't have activity in it or could have the rewards of it. And in fact over the last couple of years, we've seen very little in terms of rewards and income off of those businesses. And so what they're asserting is that we should have taken at-risk revenues that were designed to incent or penalize shareholders and apply them elsewhere. ","And then finally, when you look at the totality of our returns over the last 15 to 20 years, you'll see that in general, they're pretty much right around our authorized return in total for the company. And so it's not like all of that went and caused it to have a company-wide excessive earnings. We were utilizing that for other parts of the business. And so there's a lot there that we will -- that will come out and be asserted differently by us as we move forward in the regulatory proceedings.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Hugh Wynne from Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I also had a question related to the Consumer Protection and Safety Division's report. What struck me most about that report were not so much the details of the audit, but the line of argument that the division was presenting, which I think you could paraphrase as something along these lines: that PG&E had a legal obligation to run its gas pipeline system in a safe, reliable fashion. It requested and received most recently, through a settlement, the revenues that it deemed necessary to do so, the events at San Bruno. And the record presented in the report indicate that the company failed in its obligation to provide safe and reliable service. Now the company is coming back and saying our large portion of our PSEP budget, which relates to more onerous regulatory standards, should be recoverable. And the amounts that are being requested for recovery are comparable to the rate base of the system. And the argument seems to say, \"Didn't we pay you once for the assets and the O&M necessary for safe and reliable service? And if you failed to provide it given that we've paid for it already, why should we pay for it again?\" And it seemed to me an argument that would strike a chord with intervenors. Obviously, it has with commission staff. It might strike a chord with commissioners themselves. So I wanted to ask you, how have you seen that argument received at the commission? And secondly, perhaps most importantly, how do you rebut it?","Anthony F. Earley","Well, we can't comment on where the commission is on this because the proceedings are going on. We'll see how they come out. But I think you have to look at it in the overall context. When you're talking about safe and reliable systems, it's measured against what are the standard practices in the industry. And I think what we've said in response, there are some places where we weren't following standard practices. And to the extent that, that was the case, then we ought to absorb those costs. But to the extent that the standards are being changed and being increased, those new requirements ought to be recoverable from our customers through our rates. And I think you're going to see across the country, as we see new national pipeline standards, I think other states will start to look at what happens here in California, you'll see the same thing that while people were following accepted practices in the past, technology has changed, the understanding of the risks have changed, and, therefore, these new standards should be recoverable as part of a normal course of business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, first 2 questions. First, Kent, other uses of cash likely in 2012 when I think about what's embedded in your guidance, and maybe even 1 or 2 sources? Can you comment on Hinkley-related costs? Can you comment on expected funds to be paid out due to the generator settlements and some of that kind of that liability that's sitting there on your balance sheet? And then can you talk about the short-term debt balance? Because the short-term debt balance is at a level we haven't seen in a long while. They're about $1.6 billion. And normally, at this time of year -- normally, the peak in short-term debt balance is third quarter not fourth quarter. So it's not -- so not all funds or proceeds being utilized, it seems for fuel and power procurement. It's for, obviously, the gas side. Can you touch on those 3 items?","Kent M. Harvey","Sure. So first of all, in terms of Hinkley, we did, as you know, accrue a liability in the third quarter for Hinkley. Those are, in terms of a cash impact, those are activities that are going to take place over many years. And we have guidance out there for a potential increase in the liability this year. And again, most of those activities would take place over many years. So I don't see that as a significant driver of short-term cash. ","In terms of generator settlements, we don't see a lot of activity there this year. I think that's a little bit further out. So again, kind of same answer. That's not a big driver of our short-term cash needs. And in terms of where we ended up the year with short-term debt, we do have a fair amount of collateral posted, which we do as part of our normal activities related to energy procurement as well as hedging. And when you have low gas prices as we currently have, while that reduces the cash outlay for procuring fuel and gas for customers, it does cause us to have the post collateral to security arrangements we have with counterparties. And that's a big driver of what you're seeing at the end of the year.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Meaning that the short-term debt balance is higher this go around versus, let's say, a year ago or 2 years ago from now at the same quarter because the lower commodity price required an increased collateral posting?","Kent M. Harvey","That's correct.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. finally -- and, Tony, this one is for you. Total cost related to San Bruno getting close to the actual rate base in the pipeline business. Is there a point -- what's, kind of, the breaking point? What's the tipping point where it's gone too far, meaning that it's too detrimental to shareholders? Or is there not a number that can be assigned to that?","Anthony F. Earley","Well, my personal view is shareholders have paid a lot of money, and I really believe that the commission needs to take that into account when they're assessing how much additional penalty ought to be involved. Because I will tell you that right now we are doing everything we can. We're not going to do anything differently or more depending on what the size of the penalty is. In fact, I think everyone, including the commission, recognizes this company needs to be financially healthy to be able to keep the investment going because we're going to be working on this for a number of years. That said, we're totally committed to whatever it takes to meet the commitments that we've made in the PSEP program and to make sure that we have the safest possible gas system. I can't put a number on that. And the reality is, we don't have a choice. We're committed to doing that. You can't just say, \"Well, we're not going to make this safe.\" We need to build credibility with our customers. And I think the way we build it is by showing we're serious with our actions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with MorningStar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I have a question on the capital structure's parent utility in that accrual along with that equity issue. Does the accrual go to the utility or will that stay at the parent?","Anthony F. Earley","No, the accrual does go to the utility.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","So how does that affect the capital structure then? The accrual ends up staying through and the cash impact doesn't come into effect during the year. When you guys go in for that capital structure review, is that going to change the equity share?","Kent M. Harvey","What happens is, for rate-making purposes, the capital structure at the utility is affected in the short-term by the accrual because you're reducing retained earnings by that amount. As we've indicated, our plans are to maintain a balanced capital structure consistent with our authorized capital structure. And that does require that we issue additional equity to offset the accrual. It eventually becomes a one-for-one impact, but because it's a non-cash accrual initially, there's a little bit of a less of an impact in the near term. But over time, it becomes a 1:1 impact.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. So then if we think back to that $300 million extra, but then you had the, correct me if I'm wrong, the $200 million accrual plus the $120 million, so $420 million of extra costs, is that -- am I hearing that correct?","Kent M. Harvey","Yes. You want to remember that the accrual for the penalty is not tax-deductible. Our ongoing gas costs, which would include the higher estimate now by $120 million, those are larger, unrecovered costs, which over time gradually will affect what would have been our retained earnings. And so again, we displace, essentially, the after-tax amount of that over time with additional equity.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, I got it. So the $600 million gets you back to the 52% based on your expectation?","Kent M. Harvey","That's correct.","Operator","We have the line of Andy Levi with Caris.","Andrew Levi - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just an insurance question. So just remind us again how much insurance you guys have?","Kent M. Harvey","Yes. At the time of the accident, for third-party liabilities, we had $992 million of insurance.","Andrew Levi - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","$992 million and you've gotten back about $100 million so far?","Kent M. Harvey","That's correct. And obviously, we don't intend to have the liability. We don't expect the liability will reach that full level.","Andrew Levi - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Can you give us any idea of, kind of, how much you've requested or filed for from insurance side thus far and whether that number changes or that's kind of what you're asking for?","Kent M. Harvey","Well, we have estimated publicly we've accrued $375 million total for the accident. We've said that the maximum liability based on our estimates is in the $600 million range. The way it works with our carriers is that as we resolve claims with third parties, then we take those claims to our insurance carriers. And our insurance policy represents a tower of insurance companies at different layers in the coverage. And so we are in the process of working through that with the first several layers of our insurance coverage, and those are the proceeds that you've seen so far. Those are for claims that have been resolved with third parties that we brought to our first few layers and have resolved the recovery with them.","Andrew Levi - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. But it sounds like the maximum amount that you're kind of looking to receive is about $600 million?","Kent M. Harvey","That's what we estimated is the maximum likely liability. But we have currently accrued the low end of our range which is $375 million. We just have not resolved that level yet of third-party claims, so we have not yet brought that magnitude to the insurance carriers.","Gabriel B. Togneri","All right.

All lines will be muted during the presentation portions of the call with an opportunity for questions-and-answers at the end.","At this time, I would like to introduce your hostess, Ms. Janet Loduca of PG&E. Thank you and enjoy your conference. You may proceed, Ms. Loduca.","Janet C. Loduca - PG&E Corp.","Thank you, Jackie, and thanks to those of you on the phone for joining us. Before I turn it over to Tony Earley, I want to remind you that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results, which is based on assumptions, forecasts, expectations and information currently available to management.","Some of the important factors that could affect the company's actual financial results are described on the second page of today's slide presentation. The slide presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures. We encourage you to review the 2016 annual report on Form 10-K that will be filed with the SEC later today and the discussion of risk factors that appears there.","With that, I'll hand it over to Tony.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - PG&E Corp.","Thank you, Janet, and good morning, everyone. I'm glad you could join us. 2016 was a really pivotal year for PG&E. We continue to deliver strong operational and financial results and resolved a number of important regulatory and legal matters. We also announced that next month, Geisha Williams will be taking over as CEO and President of PG&E Corporation and Nick Stavropoulos will be taking over as President and Chief Operating Officer of our utility, Pacific Gas & Electric.","Both Geisha and Nick have done an outstanding job over the last several years and have established proven track records for delivering results. So I couldn't be more thrilled about their appointments and look forward to continuing to work with them in my capacity as Chairman.","Today, I'm going to spend a few minutes reviewing some of the highlights from 2016 and then I'll turn it over to Geisha for a few remarks and then Jason will walk us through the financials.","So let me start with our safety and operational performance. In 2016, we experienced some of the most severe storms we've seen in years. While this was good news for our hydro-generation and for the drought, it impacted our ability to meet our 2016 reliability targets. Despite all of the storms, however, we were still able to deliver the second best electric reliability performance in the company's history. This was in part due to our continued investments in a modern self-healing grid that automatically isolates and minimizes customer outages.","And we continue to strengthen our gas system by inspecting and upgrading hundreds of miles of transmission pipeline and replacing over 100 miles of distribution main. We also continue to deliver industry leading results on our gas and electric emergency response times. On the customer side, I'm excited to share that our most recent J.D. Power results for our electric business customers improved to first quartile. Customers continue to notice and appreciate the operational improvements that we've made.","So turning to regulatory and legal issues, we made a lot of progress in 2016. In December, we received a final Phase 2 decision in our Gas Transmission and Storage rate case, which gives us certainty on our gas transmission revenues through 2018. In our General Rate Case, we're waiting for a proposed decision on our all-party settlement agreement. If approved, it will provide certainty on our gas and electric distribution and electric generation revenues through 2019. We also reached a settlement agreement in our cost of capital case. The terms include a two-year extension, which takes us through the end of 2019, a true-up for authorized cost of debt beginning in 2018 and reinstatement of the trigger mechanism for 2019. We also agreed to reduce our return on equity from 10.4% to 10.25% beginning in 2018. We're hopeful this settlement will be approved in the coming months.","I also want to acknowledge the recent decision in the criminal case. In January, the court sentenced us to a $3 million fine, a five-year probation period, oversight by a third-party monitor, and certain requirements related to advertising and community service.","As you'll recall, last year, we announced we would not appeal the five integrity management counts. We've also now decided not to appeal the obstruction of justice count. As we focus on the future, I want to assure all of our stakeholders that the San Bruno incident has fundamentally changed the way we operate this company. We remain absolutely committed to ensuring that we meet the high safety standards that all of our stakeholders and we ourselves demand and expect.","As we look to the future of the industry, despite the uncertainty at the Federal level, California will continue to lead the way in transitioning to a clean energy economy. PG&E will be a critical partner in these efforts and is well-positioned to help the state achieve its goals. In 2016, nearly 70% of the energy we delivered was greenhouse gas-free. Nearly 33% of our portfolio was RPS eligible, which puts us about four years ahead of the state's 2020 target. We remain confident that we can meet or exceed our target of 55% renewable resources by 2031.","We continue to have more electric vehicles and private rooftop solar installations in our service territory than anywhere else in the country. And with the transportation sector accounting for about 40% of California's greenhouse gas emissions, we expect to play a significant role in helping the state address these emissions by investing in the infrastructure necessary to enable electric vehicle adoption.","To that end, last December, the Commission authorized $130 million over the next three years to install the infrastructure necessary to support about 7,500 EV charging stations. In January, we filed a request to spend an additional $250 million, primarily for the infrastructure to support electrification of medium and heavy-duty vehicles like transit buses.","The request also includes infrastructure for fast chargers as well some smaller pilots. With the state targeting 1.5 million electric vehicles by 2025, we see the potential to expand these programs in the coming years.","In closing, I want to say how much I have truly enjoyed leading this company over the last five-and-a-half years. The good news for me is that, I will continue to work with one of the most talented executive teams in our industry as Executive Chairman. Geisha and Nick are absolutely the right people to lead this company into the future and we've recently restructured the team to better take advantage of the opportunities we have in the coming years.","So with that let me turn it over to Geisha, to share a few words.","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Thank you so much, Tony, and good morning everyone. First, I have to say we've been so lucky, that we've had Tony at the helm over the last five years or so, and we're still fortunate that he's going to be continuing, engage with us as Executive Chairman. He's done a tremendous job leading us through a challenging period and has really set us up for a successful future.","So thank you, Tony, really, really appreciate all you've done.","I also want to say, how truly excited I'm to lead this iconic company at such an amazing time in our industry. As we look forward, I'm going to be focused on three areas.","First, and always first continuing to build on the strong safety and operational progress we've made in the last several years.","Second, providing first-class customer service and maintaining affordable bills, so that we can be our customer's preferred provider of choice. And third, positioning PG&E for success within the changing utility industry, because as Tony said, California will continue to be at the forefront of this change. So it's really an exciting time to be in this industry, particularly here in California.","We are confident in our ability to execute on a strong growth plan through continued investments in upgrading and modernizing our system, as we help the state achieve its clean energy goals. I've enjoyed meeting many of you over the last few months, and I look forward to meeting more of you throughout the year.","So, with that I'm going to turn things over to Jason to walk us through the financials.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Thank you, Geisha, and hello, everyone. Before I review our financial results, I know that tax reform has been top of mind for many of you. So I thought I would share at a high level, how we're thinking about it. Given that we don't know the scope or timing of reform, there is still a lot of uncertainty around what the final legislation will include. I'll base my comments on the House Republican Blueprint, which includes a 20% corporate tax rate, no interest deductibility and 100% expensing of capital.","Overall, we believe we're well positioned to address the impacts of tax reform. Income taxes are part of our regulated cost of service, and we would expect that the net benefit or cost with any of the proposed changes would largely flow to our customers. With respect to the reduction in corporate tax rates, customers would benefit in a couple of ways. First, the lower tax rate creates excess deferred taxes that would be refunded to our customers over time.","As indicated on slide 5, the utility has about a $10.5 billion net deferred tax liability. This balance would be reduced by about one-third if the corporate tax rate is lowered to 20%. Second, customer rates would be reduced to reflect the net impact of the lower tax rate going forward. At the holding company, our net deferred tax assets are about $300 million. A reduction in the federal tax rate to 20% would reduce the value of these assets by about 40%. While this amount would not be recoverable from customers, it also would not increase equity needs, as these balances are not factored into the utility's equity ratio. Finally, the lower tax rate will be a net positive from a rate base perspective, as it will result in slower future growth of deferred taxes.","The next component I'll cover is the additional tax expense created from the elimination of the interest deduction which would be passed to customers through the cost of capital. We don't expect a material shareholder impact from the loss of the interest expense deduction given that we don't have significant outstanding debt at the holding company.","Turning to the component that would allow for full expensing of capital, we expect the impact to be minimal in the near-term given our net operating loss. Longer-term, we'd expect this to moderate our rate base growth. We're not quantifying the potential rate base impact at this point as we're still very early in the process and there are a lot of variables that could impact certain tax deductions and our NOL.","Finally, just a few words on cash flows. On a net basis, we do not expect these proposed tax reforms to have a significant near-term impact on cash flows. On the tax payments side, this is because of our NOL. On the revenue side this is because we're currently expensing about $1 billion in capital via repairs and flowing that benefit back to customers.","The revenue reduction from the lower federal tax rate would be mitigated by the reduced flow through benefit. So the bottom line is, we're in a good position with respect to various tax reform proposals. We believe that the net impact of these reforms will create bill capacity that may provide opportunities to increase our capital spend related to incremental infrastructure and grid modernization benefits, which we will balance with our goal of maintaining affordable service for our customers.","So let me shift to our fourth quarter and year-end results, which are on slide 6. Earnings from operations came in at $1.33 for the quarter and $3.76 for the year. GAAP earnings including the items impacting comparability are also shown here. Pipeline related expenses were $33 million pre-tax for the quarter and $113 million pre-tax for the year. We incurred legal and regulatory related expenses of $18 million pre-tax for the quarter and $72 million pre-tax for the year. These last two items are consistent with the guidance we previously provided.","Fines and penalties came in at $170 million pre-tax for the quarter and $498 million pre-tax for the year. This is primarily related to the San Bruno penalty decision and disallowances imposed for the ex parte communications in Phase 2 of the Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case decision. Butte fire related costs, net of insurance were $46 million pre-tax for the quarter and $232 million pre-tax for the year.","As you'll recall, in the first quarter of last year we took a charge for $350 million pre-tax, which represented the low end of the range for third-party property damages. It did not include any costs for fire suppression, personal injury or other damages that PG&E could be liable for if we were found to be negligent. While our position continues to be that we were not negligent, this question would ultimately be decided by a jury if we were to go to trial.","This quarter, we've increased the low end of the range to $750 million pre-tax, which takes into account the risk of all known claims including negligence. We continue to be unable to estimate the high end of the range at this time. We also incurred legal costs related to the fire of $27 million pre-tax. We've increased the insurance receivable to $625 million, which represents the low end of the range for insurance recoveries.","As we noted last year, we expect to seek full recovery for all insured losses, so this amount should not be viewed as a ceiling on recovery. Finally, as a reminder, last year we took charges totaling about $80 million for cleanup and repair costs that are not recoverable.","Moving to the next item, we reported $29 million pre-tax for the quarter and $219 million pre-tax for the year related to the capital disallowances ordered in the Phase 1 Gas Transmission Rate Case decision. As you'll recall, the Phase 1 decision included a number of cost gaps and one-way balancing accounts, and we took a charge in the second quarter to reflect our best estimate of capital program costs that would exceed authorized amounts over the rate case period. The increase this quarter reflects our updated estimate of these costs based on more detailed project planning.","Lastly, we booked revenue of $325 million pre-tax for both the quarter and year, which reflects recognition of gas transmission revenues in excess of our 2016 cost of service. We'd originally estimated $350 million based on high-level revenue assumptions. The actual out of period revenues were slightly lower.","On slide 7, you'll see our quarter-over-quarter comparison of earnings from operations of $0.50 in Q4 of last year to $1.33 in Q4 of this year. With the final Phase 2 Gas Transmission decision, we were able to record revenues that were $0.48 higher compared to the same quarter last year.","As a reminder, we'll be recovering the Gas Transmission under collection over 36 months and can record only 29 months of that revenue in 2016. The remaining seven months of the under collection will be recorded in the first quarter of 2017. Timing of taxes was $0.20 positive for the quarter and results in a net zero impact for the year.","We had $0.06 favorable as a result of the Diablo Canyon refueling outage in 2015 that we didn't have in the same period in 2016. Rate base earnings increased $0.05 for the quarter. We had $0.01 negative for the increase in outstanding shares and $0.05 favorable for a number of miscellaneous items.","Miscellaneous includes the full severance charge for the organizational changes we announced in January. This was partially offset by lower contract costs as a result of efficiency measures in the fourth quarter and lower incentive compensation in 2016, compared to 2015.","Transitioning now to slide 8, we are reaffirming 2017 earnings from operations guidance of $3.55 to $3.75 per share.","Our underlying assumptions are on page 9. While our overall capital expenditures in 2017 are consistent with what we shared last quarter, we've had some movement between planned rate cases. Capacity-related project delays have reduced our Electric Transmission spend. These projects weren't slated to come online for several years, so you'll notice that our rate base is unchanged.","These reductions were offset by incremental plan spend, primarily in our gas distribution and transmission businesses. It remains our objective to earn the CPUC authorized return on equity across the enterprise as a whole.","Moving to slide 10, we have two updates to our 2017 items impacting comparability. First, fines and penalties now reflect $15 million for the portion of the ex parte penalty imposed in the Gas Transmission Phase 2 decision that we will recognize in the first quarter of 2017. This item does not include an estimate for potential future fines that may result from other proceedings including the ongoing Ex Parte Order Instituting Investigation. Second, the Gas Transmission revenue timing impact has been reduced by $10 million for a total of $150 million. This will also be recorded in the first quarter. As I mentioned, actual out of period revenues were slightly lower than what we had forecasted.","On slide 11, we're reaffirming our 2017 equity needs with a range of $400 million to $600 million. In 2018 and 2019, we still expect our equity needs to be met largely through internal programs, which historically have contributed approximately $350 million annually to our equity needs.","Finally, on slides 12 and 13, we're affirming our CapEx and rate base guidance through 2019. While we're still targeting 6.5% to 7% rate base growth through 2019, there are a couple of changes to the underlying assumptions on slide 13. The base case now incorporates the final electric vehicle infrastructure decision that we received last December. It does not yet include our recent filing to support medium and heavy-duty vehicle electrification. While we're not providing longer term EPS guidance, it remains our objective to earn our CPUC authorized return on equity across the enterprise in 2018 and 2019. Assuming the Commission approves the cost of capital settlement, our authorized return on equity will be 10.25% in 2018.","I'll close by saying it's been a strong year for the company. As Geisha said, our focus on upgrading and modernizing our system to support the state's clean energy goals provides a strong growth trajectory in the future. Assuming the cost of capital settlement is approved, we'll have certainty on our cost of capital structure and return on equity through 2019, and we continue to target 6.5% to 7% rate base growth and a 60% dividend payout ratio by 2019.","So with that, let's open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, everyone. Well done. I wanted to follow up on the...","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - PG&E Corp.","Thank you.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","...cost cutting announcement of late. I wanted to just understand a little bit on how that's gets factored into not just 2017 guidance but beyond, and your ability to kind of earn at or above your authorized or your new authorized ROE sort of during the pendency of what should be new rates in effect?","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Hi, Julien, this is Geisha. How are you? So...","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Good.","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","...you should think of those first $300 million cost efficiency measure that we've put in place as being part of our plan to actually meet our guidance in 2017. So I wouldn't really expect there to be additional sort of upside from that. What you should also expect though is that like any other great company out there, we're going to be really focused on managing our costs. We're going to be looking at how to improve our processes and you should think of this $300 million first initiative as just that, a first step in what's going to be a long term affordability journey. We're really proud of the fact that our customer bills are below national average and we want to work really hard to make sure that that continues to be the case, because we have a strong capital plan and that could put upward pressure on customer rates. So we're doing everything in our power to keep our bills affordable and to drive efficiencies as we move on.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. And then a quick second question. I'd just be curious, Geisha, obviously you've had a few months here. In terms of hard asset acquisitions outside of the kind of core rate base utility, what's your latest thinking on that prospect? And maybe more importantly the parameters to the extent to which you are looking at something that you would evaluate looking outside of rate base?","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","I think as you look at where we are today, we've put a lot of things behind us. We have a very strong balance sheet. Our focus is really on executing on what we think is a strong growth plan. We've got a lot of work to do and with $6 billion or so in capital additions every year, we think that getting that done, getting that done efficiently is really going to serve us well.","Notwithstanding, though to answer your question, we're building the muscle, we're building the discipline internally so that should something come up that frankly is accretive, that makes sense, that makes sense for our shareholders, that's consistent with our core operations, et cetera, that we'd be ready to be able to act. But I wouldn't expect us to sort of come out of the gate, looking for M&A activity. We don't feel like we need to do. We really have a strong growth profile and our focus is really going to be about executing and doing a great job for our customers.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Excellent. Well said. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Smith. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. I just wanted to see if you wouldn't mind kind of framing some of the things on slide 13 that maybe aren't in your current rate base guidance. For example, can you talk a little bit about the first two items, kind of directionally where you see FERC Electric Transmission spend needing to go over the next couple of years, and getting out to the 2019, 2020 timeframe were GT&S spend. I mean I know you're not going to put hard numbers on this, but I'm just trying to think about it, is it flat, up or down?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Good morning, Michael. This is Jason. As it relates to the electric transmission business, there's a couple of competing pressures on that business. One, load is moderating in the state. And so that would sort of reduce the need for incremental capacity projects. That being said, we are increasing our renewable portfolio standard, so there will be more large scale utility renewable projects coming online and need to be connected to the grid. And so we think currently today, our conservative assumption around holding 2018 and 2019 spend flat to what we've received in the 2017 rate case and what we've requested in the 2017 rate case appears reasonable.","In the Gas Transmission and Storage business, we've really stepped up our spending quite a bit in the 2015 rate case that we just received. And so, when I look at 2019, there's still a lot of work that needs to be done on the system. The drivers that we see supporting that CapEx spend are very much longer term in nature. But I will say that that 2015 rate case was the first time that we really stepped up our revenues post San Bruno. So I think that increase was a bit of an anomaly and I wouldn't factor that in going forward.","I do think the real opportunity is in helping the state facilitate its longer term carbon goals, particularly around electrification. And so, as Tony mentioned, we recently filed an initial application for medium and heavy-duty vehicles, but really we think that helping support further electrification in the state provides upside to these plans longer term.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And just thinking about the Butte fire, can you talk \u2013 I'm going make sure I've got the numbers right here about how much cash you've spent since this occurred? Meaning what's the net total of the cash that's kind of gone out the door for this? And I'm just trying to compare that to the insurance receivable. And so, I'm not looking just for kind of the 2016 amount and the last quarter amount, just kind of the total.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Sorry, Mike. I'm just kind of digging that number out. There is a couple of different components here, so we took about an $80 million charge for cleanup and repair costs. Obviously that was cash that was previously spent. In terms of sort of claims that we've encountered today, it's about $60 million that we've paid out. And we brought in insurance roughly of about $50 million.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","So you really have to look at those individual components.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","But you mentioned the insurance receivable of $625 million, was that for other items unrelated to this or is that predominantly related to the Butte wildfire?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Yeah, so the $625 million, I would look at it as offsetting the claims associated with the Butte wildfire plus legal costs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","So we've incurred I think roughly $27 million in legal costs to-date, and we have now assumed that the low end of the range for the Butte fire will be $750 million. The combination of those two, we're going to seek recovery from insurers for those two costs. We took a conservative assumption of about an 80% recovery, which was the $625 million that we recognized as an insurance receivable this quarter.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","That's for the full year.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, Jason. Much appreciated guys.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Lapides. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, hi. Just a couple of quick questions, first on the cost of capital settlement. Are you getting any indications, if anyone will be opposing the settlement?","Steven E. Malnight - Pacific Gas & Electric Co.","Hi. This is Steve Malnight from the Regulatory team. The settlement was actually conducted with most of the active parities in that proceeding. So at this point in time, we expect that we've addressed most of the parties. We don't think we've actually lapsed the full time for others to potentially raise their hand, but we feel pretty good about the coalition we've put together there.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. And then also there was a, I think at the last meeting there was I think some stories about Commission meeting and some press stories about just people complaining about their bills. I assume that's probably just the GT&S case having been delayed and over time, kind of hitting bills. Is that what it would be and is there anything that you're doing to kind of address concerns there?","Steven E. Malnight - Pacific Gas & Electric Co.","Yeah, just to give a little clarity to that, we have definitely seen an uptick in concerns around winter bills, particularly for gas usage, for some of our customers. Just to give a little context for that, in August of last year, we actually implemented an increase in the Gas Transmission rates to incorporate the Phase 1 decision from GT&S. That accounted for about a 19% increase for the average residential customer.","As we've talked about, that was a substantial step-up in spending in that case and it was delayed pretty substantially from the initial time period when the rates would go into effect. To help to kind of moderate that, in January, we actually implemented a reduction in rates of about 8%, which is the reflection of the Phase 2 decision where they then implemented, the San Bruno penalty and the ex parte fine in that proceeding.","So we really think that will help to moderate it. Obviously, we've had a stronger winter here in California this year than prior years, which has also led to increased usage. It's something we pay a lot of attention to. We're very focused on it. We are really committed to, as Geisha said, make sure we keep our bills affordable for our customers. So we work with them when there are concerns to help them understand how they can reduce their usage through efficiency programs and other things and help save, so something we pay a lot of attention to.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Fleishman. Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please proceed.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much. Hi, guys.","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Morning.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. So, quickly on the electrification, just wanted to understand a little bit more in terms of context. I know the near-term programs you've talked about on transportation, electrification, longer-term, how do you see growth coming from that and how do you offset that against either energy efficiency or behind-the-meter storage that may shave peaks, so, some context would be helpful?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Yeah. So from a load standpoint, in terms of kind of the puts and takes there, in our service territory, an electric vehicle sort of represents an average household of consumption, about half an average household of consumption. So you can think of for every two electric vehicles we add to the system, essentially we're offsetting the decline that we see from distributed generation. So that's sort of I think an easy rule of thumb to think about load from that standpoint. And I think from a growth standpoint financially, the state has a goal of having 1.5 million electric vehicles on the road in California by 2025. That would equate to about 600,000 vehicles in our service territory.","We think and the state thinks that we need distributed charging stations for every four vehicles that are on the road. So that would be a need for approximately 150,000 charging stations in our service territory. We think we're best positioned to facilitate that build-out and provide that service to our customers in our service territory. And so, just initial application, which we just recently had approved, that was only for 7,500 charging stations. So we see the opportunity for fairly significant growth over the next several years to help enable the state to meet its overall policy goals.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. That's really helpful context. Thanks. And then secondly on CCAs, I know this is a topic that keeps coming up. I think Chairman (sic) [President] Picker was talking about 40% targets or potentially 40% that could be reached in terms of loads served through CCAs. How do you see that transition of CCAs and is there any risk of stranded assets sometime in the future?","Geisha J. Williams - PG&E Corp.","Hi. This is Geisha. So, I think, when I saw the same number, the 40% from President Picker, I think he was thinking about it in a state-wide context. Our service area is a little bit different. Our service area is made up of many small municipalities and counties. So, in our case, we think that that transition to higher levels of CCA adoption are going to take a little bit longer. But we think the number is generally right. It's just going to happen over a longer period of time.","What we're doing in terms of preparing for that, of course, is the first and most important is we have a really flexible energy supply portfolio. So, for example, about 55% of the energy that we deliver to our customers is actually procured from third parties. And those contracts tend to be a combination of both long-term and spot market purchases. So, of the 55% that we have now under contract, nearly 40% represents megawatt hours that we do not have a contractual obligation to take in 2021. And the reason I bring that up is as CCA adoption grows, we're really executing on our very flexible energy portfolio. So, we believe, we've got the triggers that we need to be able to meet the load over time. And I hope that answers your question?","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. That's really helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Mehta. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning. How are you?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Morning.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - PG&E Corp.","Hey, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","There was a transmission complaint case that was filed by the California PUC and others, regarding Order 890 on the transmission planning process. Just wondering if you could maybe address your thoughts about that complaint and this apparent desire to have input on transmission planning to a greater degree on the part of the California parties?","Steven E. Malnight - Pacific Gas & Electric Co.","Yeah, hi. This is Steve Malnight, again. Let me give a little context for that. So, in early February the CPUC and other parties, as you said, they filed a complaint at FERC seeking really to establish a process for stakeholders to be more involved in the portion of our transmission planning spend, that's not subject to the ISO review here in California. So, just to give \u2013 to help clarify that. So, the ISO currently reviews our planned work for capacity and reliability projects, but they don't review other work such as our normal maintenance activities and things like that. So this is a complaint that the parties are filing. We're going to replying to that here shortly in a few weeks, and we'll see how that proceeds. I think, as we said, we had gone through several TO cases over the last several years, and continued to put them forward under the current framework and settle those cases. So we'll work our way through this issue as well.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And I don't want you to necessarily preempt your filing. I just was wondering if you had a general sort of response to sort of the questions that were raised and it seems a little bit more than what the TO cases were in the past and that's all I was trying to get at. Again, I don't mean to ask you to tell us what you're going to file in response, but if you could follow what I'm saying, just any sense as to what's necessarily driving this other than of course the PJM complaint that we saw in the summer or anything else?","Steven E. Malnight - Pacific Gas & Electric Co.","Well, I guess I would say this. I mean, the cost components that are at issue here in this complaint, these are cost components that we have sought recovery for through the TO case and settled for multiple years. So I think I'm kind of going to leave it at that. I think we'll just see how this plays out at FERC as we move forward.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And then Tony, is this your last earnings call?","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - PG&E Corp.","It's the last one where I'll be speaking, I'll be listening in.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Well, congratulations and good luck on the future. Thanks.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - PG&E Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Patterson. Our next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please proceed.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Good morning. Thank you. I was wondering real quick, the ROE settlement, how would that, if at all, impact the transmission earnings and allowed ROE?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","From an earnings standpoint, it's our objective to earn the CPUC authorized return on equity on a whole for the enterprise The reason why we say that it's because the FERC rate cases have historically been settled. And as part of the settlement, it's essentially a black box. So we don't specify directly the return on equity in those rate cases.","So I think it's a fair assumption from a modeling standpoint just to apply the CPUC authorized return on equity across all of our rate base. We separately, we'll look at when we file the next TO rate case, kind of the support for the cost of capital at that time, particularly the return on equity, and we'll have to see what the factors are at that point.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. And then, if you're able to say here, in terms of that black box, how much do those negotiations and FERC's view depend on kind of a state level ROE plus adder type of framework there?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","In the last filing we filed for 10.4 as the base with a 50 basis point adder. And we continue to believe that 50 basis point adder is appropriate. We'll continue to file for that. That obviously return on equity is a component that is negotiated as part of the overall settlement. But again, we don't individually negotiate final settlement terms. It's just an overall black box settlement.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. Got it. And then a broader question, given work that you guys did, the success and you had resolving things in 2016, what's the next big regulatory hurdle for you guys? Does it go all the way out to the next GRC or is there something here that presents some material risk on the regulatory side in the next two years or so? Assuming all the settlements go through, right, and that's obviously still a risk. But assuming those go through, what's the next big risk?","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","Assuming that all \u2013 and we do assume that all the settlements will go through \u2013 our next big rate case filing will actually be the Gas Transmission Storage Rate Case for 2019. And we typically file most of our rate cases sort of late summer, kind of early fall. So from a rate case standpoint that's the next big one on the horizon. I will say we need to close out the OII associated with our ex parte violations. And so from a standpoint of a risk that that is one that we need to resolve here and are actively in settlement negotiations to resolve that here hopefully shortly.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. So, it sounds kind of like 2018 is, I hate to say it, I will use it in my words not yours, but it's kind of in the books, if you don't have any pending rate cases, right and other regulatory activities, if all of that is resolved, the settlements resolved in 2017 then it's really not a whole lot, right, that would jeopardize 2018. So...","Jason P. Wells - PG&E Corp.","I won't say that we have, we do file with the FERC annually, but I do believe we have good clarity on our plan, given the fact that we have either settled rate cases or all-party settlement supporting the majority of our spend over the planning horizon, as well as the settlement that we discussed with the cost of capital proceeding. So, we think we have really strong line of sight to the rate base growth that we've articulated today, and we have a strong path the dividend payout ratio of 60% by 2019.","Anthony F. Earley Jr. - PG&E Corp.","So this is Tony. This is kind of the theme that we've been talking about over the last couple of months and why I said, 2016 was really a pivotal year. We now are able to focus on the future far more intensely than we have been in the past, where we were just dealing with the various cases. Now, as Jason said, we still have one OII, we've got our Diablo Canyon settlement case. They are still out there, that has to be resolved. But yeah, when you're talking about a revenue stream coming forward, we've got the two big cases and hopefully we'll get the rate case settlement approved. We now are focusing on the changes that are going on in the industry and the opportunities that we have to invest in the clean energy future in California, which is clearly part of this Governor's objective and the legislators objectives, and the Commission's objectives. And that's why I think, we're really well set up to align with those desires.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","No, that's great, appreciate it.","Janet C. Loduca - PG&E Corp.","Okay. This is Janet. I just want to thank everyone for participating today and we'll be talking to you in the future. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for attending the fourth quarter PG&E Corporation Earnings Conference Call. This now concludes the conference.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Before you hear from Tony Earley, Chris Johns and Kent Harvey, I'll remind you that our discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results based on assumptions, forecasts, expectations and information currently available to management. Some of the important factors that could affect the company's actual financial results are described on the second page of today's slide deck. We also encourage you to review the Form 10-Q that will be filed with the SEC later today and the discussion of risk factors that appears there and in the 2013 Annual Report.","And with that, I'll hand it over to Tony.","Anthony F. Earley","Well, thanks, Sara; and good morning, everyone. I'll start off my remarks today by touching on a few items of importance, and then Chris is going to cover the status of our operations and regulatory matters and Kent will conclude with the financials.","So I'll start with Slide 3. We remain focused on our mission of operating a safe, reliable and affordable utility for our customers. Our objectives are to resolve the gas issues, position the company for long-term success and partner effectively with others to shape policy and create value for our customers.","Let me start with the gas issues. Unfortunately, we still haven't received the presiding officer's decision in the pending gas investigations. Although the record was complete last October, the proceeding continues to take a long time to be resolved. In fact just this week you probably saw that the city of San Bruno filed some motions raising questions about the propriety of communications between PG&E and the CPUC. I want to be clear that we are absolutely committed to conduct ourselves in an ethical manner and in compliance with CPUC rules at all times, and we take seriously any questions about the conduct of PG&E employees. As any regulated utility does, we communicate with the CPUC almost constantly on a wide range of issues. To ascertain whether our communications were appropriate, we will carefully review the documents in question and will take appropriate actions.","Looking at the big picture as we approach the fourth anniversary of the San Bruno accident, we look to the commission to bring these proceedings to a close and to do so in a way that acknowledges PG&E's unprecedented response since the accident.","Moving on to the federal arena. As you know, we expected the U.S. Attorney to file additional charges against the company. And on Wednesday, they issued a superseding indictment. Essentially, there are 3 primary changes in the indictment. It added 15 additional charges under the Pipeline Safety Act and referenced an additional code section. They have also alleged that the utility obstructed the NTSB's investigation of the accident based on a letter we submitted to the NTSB, which is on the NTSB's website and which we still stand by. And finally, for purposes of determining the maximum fine, they have alleged, with no details, that the utility derived $281 million in gains and that there were $565 million in losses. Let me just state that based on all the evidence that we have seen we still do not believe any of these criminal charges or fines are warranted.","Moving on from the gas issues. In a key step forward for the company, we did receive the proposed decision on our 2014 General Rate Case. You'll recall that the GRC sets base revenues through 2016 for 3 key parts of our company: electric distribution, gas distribution and electric generation.","The proposed decision would provide revenue requirement increases well below those we requested to fund important progress in safety and reliability and, obviously, we like to see some improvement in. For instance, the proposed decision would deny funding to accelerate our gas distribution leak survey cycle to every 3 years compared with the current 5-year cycle. It would also deny our request to treat every gas odor call as requiring immediate response instead of screening some out for later action. We also believe that we should have received a larger increase in depreciation rates. We've raised these and other concerns in the comments that we filed with the commission.","Having said that, as a percentage of the request, the proposed decision is within the range of other recent GRC decisions made by the commission. And the proposed attrition adjustments for 2015 and 2016 do reflect the magnitude of our capital program, which is critical to us. As I've explained in the past, we spent the last few years improving our company-wide planning process and developing our continuous improvement skills. Thus, although it will be challenging, we intend to manage our costs consistent with the final authorized revenue requirement in order to earn our authorized return this year, except for the gas transmission business. The commission should be able to vote on the proposed decision as soon as August, and we look forward to their reaching a reasonable and timely final decision in this important case.","So now I'll turn it over to Chris to talk about the progress we're making in our operations. Chris?","Christopher P. Johns","Thanks, Tony; and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my remarks with an update on our operations and then touch on some additional regulatory developments from the quarter.","Starting with gas operations. On Slide 4, you can see that we continued to execute unparalleled levels of work on our gas pipelines as we enhance the safety and integrity of our system. In May, our gas business received 2 international certifications: Publicly Available Specification or PAS-55 and International Organization for Standardization ISO-55001 for best-in-class operations standards. We're the only gas company in the United States and 1 of a very few worldwide to hold both of these prestigious certifications from Lloyd's Register, who is an independent auditor. These certifications provide important external validation of the safety culture and the asset management strategy and standards that our gas team has been working so hard to implement. Now this doesn't mean that we do everything perfectly, but it shows we've made tremendous strides and are focused on the right work.","Another item I want to mention is our program to remediate encroachments in our gas pipeline rights-of-way. We had previously intended to provide an updated cost estimate for the program around midyear. However, earlier this year, we encountered concerns in some of the Bay Area communities about our planned vegetation management remediation activities. We've taken some extra time to work through these issues, and we have reached several agreements with the affected communities that will allow us to resume our work in ways that address community concerns and enable us to ensure the safety of our pipelines. As a result of this effort, we've remediated fewer encroachments than we had planned at this point in the year and are not yet in a position to refine our overall cost estimate. However, we continue to believe that we will not exceed our original $500 million estimate and that we'll still complete this program by the end of 2017.","One more operational item worthy of note. Our Energy Supply Team recently received external validation of the work they've been doing to keep our nuclear plant operating safely. Last year, inspectors from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission spent more than 7,500 hours conducting detailed inspections on our Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant. And at a meeting in May, the NRC announced the results of its assessment, which found Diablo Canyon to be among the highest performing plants in the nation in 2013. We're obviously proud of this result. It's a great achievement.","Shifting to regulatory matters. During the quarter, we received approval that the revenue requirement in our Gas Transmission & Storage Rate Case will be retroactive to January 1, 2015, even though the final decision will come later, and it's currently scheduled for March. Given the significance of this case, retroactive treatment was a very important issue in the proceeding.","Next. Just this month, we announced that we reached a settlement on our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan update filing. You'll recall that we filed the PSEP update application in the fall of 2013 after we finished validating the maximum allowable operating pressure of all 6,700 miles of our gas transmission pipelines. Other parties to the proceeding proposed significant disallowances to that update. The PSEP update settlement resulted in a $23 million reduction in the amounts we may recover from our customers. Although this represents an increase in the shareholder funding to complete the PSEP work, we still expect the item impacting comparability for natural gas matters to fall within the range of $250 million to $450 million that we provided for this year. And by settling the case, we eliminate the uncertainty and can focus our full efforts on the gas transmission and storage rate case.","Finally, in electric transmission, on July 15, we filed a settlement with FERC for our Transmission Owner 15 Rate Case. This is a black-box settlement without a specific finding regarding authorized ROE. The settlement resulted in an increase in the revenue requirement of about $22 million above the previous rates. And we continue to target earning a return on our electric transmission business that's comparable to the amounts authorized by the CPUC for other parts of our business. And yesterday, we filed our next electric transmission rate case, TO16, with FERC. We're requesting an ROE of 11.26%, along with an increased revenue requirement in that case.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Kent.","Kent M. Harvey","Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Q2 was a pretty straightforward quarter in terms of our financials. So I'll briefly walk you through that and then cover some implications of the proposed decision in our general rate case.","Slide 5 summarizes the results for the second quarter. Earnings from operations were $0.69, and GAAP results were $0.57. The item impacting comparability for natural gas matters totaled $0.12 negative, and you can see our Q2 pipeline-related expenses of $97 million pretax in the table at the bottom. We expect higher pipeline-related expenses in the second half of the year when the majority of the work is planned.","You can also see that we didn't report any insurance recoveries in Q2. However, we have been in discussions with insurers about recovery of our remaining claims.","Slide 6 shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations and the key differences from Q2 results last year. About $0.04 negative is due to the fact that without a final decision in our pending general rate case, we're not booking sufficient revenues to cover our capital-related expenses for much of the business. You'll remember we had a similar impact in Q1. After the commission issues a final decision in the general rate case, which will be retroactive to January 1, we'd expect to recover the revenues associated with these costs, plus earn a return on a larger authorized rate base in 2014.","Another $0.04 negative is due to the increase in shares outstanding. And $0.03 is due to miscellaneous items, including the absence of some regulatory pickups we had in Q2 last year.","We've actually included within the miscellaneous total a gain from the disposition of some shares in SolarCity, which we obtained in connection with tax equity investments we made at the corporation a few years back.","So that's the summary of quarterly results. As you know, pending resolution of the general rate case and the gas investigations of the PUC, we've not provided guidance for earnings from operations; but we have given you some key inputs, such as ranges for CapEx and rate base.","I want to spend a few minutes talking about what the implications for those ranges would be if the proposed decision in the general rate case were approved as is.","If you turn to Slide 7, I'll start with CapEx. Our guidance range for our 2014 CapEx has been $5 billion to $6 billion. The upper end of that range reflects the CapEx level requested in our various regulatory filings, and the lower end of the range reflects our 2013 spend with a few adjustments for things like the conclusion of our Cornerstone Program and our utility-owned photovoltaic program. Compared to that range, the General Rate Case proposed decision would imply total CapEx of about $5.3 billion for this year.","To the right, you see the same information for authorized rate base. Compared to an original range of $28 billion to $28.5 billion, the proposed decision would imply a 2014 rate base at the lower end of that range, right about $28 billion. The main reason for this is that the proposed decision assumes a lower level of 2013 CapEx than we forecasted, resulting in a lower starting point for rate base in 2014. If the proposed decision is approved as is, we wouldn't expect to true-up this difference until our next General Rate Case.","A heads-up because it's confused some people. If you actually look at the proposed decision, the rate base numbers for electric distribution and electric generation will not match this table here since we've included some items that are not -- that are recovered outside of the General Rate Case, such as the remaining rate base on the conventional meters that we have replaced with SmartMeters and our utility-owned photovoltaic installation.","Finally, at the bottom right, we've previously highlighted the underearning on our gas transmission business, which when netted against other factors, such as incentive revenues for energy efficiency programs, was expected to negatively affect 2014 operating earnings by roughly $0.10. We now hope to fully offset this impact in 2014 and eliminate this negative $0.10. The drivers for this change include higher gas transmission revenues resulting from increased gas-fired generation given our dry hydro conditions in the state and the disposition of SolarCity shares I mentioned before.","Turning to Slide 8. You'll see the estimated range for our item impacting comparability for natural gas matters in 2014, which we're maintaining at $350 million to $450 million pretax. The settlement we reached in connection with the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan update filing, which Chris mentioned, by itself would increase our unrecovered expenses by about $23 million this year. However, we continue to believe that total unrecovered expenses, including the PSEP settlement, will fall within our guidance range of $350 million to $450 million.","At the bottom of the slide is a reminder that these figures exclude future insurance recoveries, which, of course, we would net against these costs, and any additional fines or penalties resulting from the gas investigations that we've not yet accrued.","Moving on to Slide 9. We continue to target between $800 million and $1 billion of equity issuance this year. This range excludes any additional fines or penalties resulting from the gas investigations which would be incremental to the range. During Q2, we issued just under $300 million of common stock. That brings to about $600 million through the first half of the year, so we're well along on our financing plan for the year.","Finally, on Slides 10 and 11, we've shown our guidance ranges for CapEx and rate base through 2016 and what the implications for those ranges would be if the proposed decision in the General Rate Case were approved as is. In all cases, the ranges implied by the proposed decision would fall within the ranges we've previously provided. For example, on Slide 11, the proposed decision would result in a range for 2016 authorized rate base of $34 billion -- $33 billion to $34 billion, which compares to our existing range of $32 billion to $35 billion.","We would very much like to receive a final decision in the General Rate Case next month. In the meantime, we hope that this information is helpful to you in understanding the potential impact of the proposed decision.","I'm going to stop there, and we can now open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","How many shares of SolarCity do you own and at what price?","Kent M. Harvey","Greg, this is Kent. I'm going to answer that question as follows. The disposition that we did in this past quarter represents roughly 1\/3 of our total holdings, so we will have additional dispositions in future periods.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So you're not at liberty to disclose your holdings or the value?","Kent M. Harvey","We've chosen not to do so.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. Can you restate -- I was distracted a little bit, 7 companies reporting today -- what you said about there's a $0.10 expense this year that you're -- be able to offset? Can you restate that, please?","Kent M. Harvey","Yes, Greg, if you go back to Slide 7, this is really where I talked about this, and it's the lower right-hand part of this slide, and it was these other factors that affect our earnings from operations. And previously we had provided the indication that when you look at all these other factors, the underearning in our gas transmission and storage business but also other factors like energy efficiency revenues that we expect to receive, when you look at all of that, we've said it -- we expected it for this year to have roughly a negative $0.10 impact on earnings from operations in 2014. And what I said earlier today is that in light of the fact that we are experiencing higher gas transmission revenues just given the really dry hydro conditions in the state and the fact that a lot of the gas-fired generators are being -- are experiencing higher demand than was previously expected and the fact that we're monetizing some shares in SolarCity, those are a few of the factors that we hope will allow us to offset that negative $0.10 for 2014.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. But should -- and I know you haven't given guidance for this year or for future years, but should we assume in a base case that you're unable to offset that negative $0.10 in future years and that this is sort of an anomaly?","Kent M. Harvey","Well, Greg, our objective next year is when we hope to resolve the Gas Transmission & Storage Rate Case and -- therefore, our objective is to earn our authorized return next year at the gas transmission business going forward on an operating basis. So that's what we expect will be different in future periods.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So that could mitigate or eliminate the drag?","Kent M. Harvey","That's correct.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. Can you comment on what the legal path is for resolving the accusations made by the City of San Bruno with regard to the emails, whether that has to go through the ALJs writing the PODs or some other venue and what impact it might have on the timing of a final decision?","Christopher P. Johns","Greg, this is Chris. Right now, what the next steps in the timeline are is that barring any kind of ruling otherwise from the ALJs the parties will all file responses within about 15 days or by August 12. And then following that, it's really up to the ALJs or the commission, and they could rule or issue a schedule for briefings and hearings if necessary. So there's not a firm schedule until they decide what that would look like. Right now, nobody's asked for -- obviously a delay in the PODs, and so it's hard to speculate as to what impact it might or might not have. But we still believe that the commission will move forward with the proposed decisions as quickly as possible.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So the issuance of the proposed decisions is independent from what's going on with this issue? Or are they linked? I'm a little confused.","Christopher P. Johns","Well, there's not necessarily an absolute link other than they are part -- they were filed as part of this process, and the ALJs and the Commission have some discretion as to they could rule on this before they do the proposed decisions; they could include them in the proposed decisions, and they potentially could keep them separate.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So the next step is within the next 15 days, people will file a response?","Christopher P. Johns","Yes, that's the only thing that we know for sure.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I want to first just get a little clarity here. So you have range of equity, and in light of the PD, how are you thinking about that? Just if you could comment specifically with regards to depreciation and accelerated depreciation. Is there any kind of thinking within that range you could provide perhaps? I'll leave it broad.","Kent M. Harvey","Julien, this is Kent. A couple of hundred million dollars range for our equity needs we think is kind of a reasonable range to have even halfway through the year. So the fact that we got the proposed decision in the General Rate Case, it provided some additional improvement in depreciation rate but certainly not our full request, and our original range assumed no increase in the depreciation rate. So there's a slight positive from that. But another underlying assumption behind our original range of $800 million to $1 billion for equity needs was also that we get a timely resolution of the General Rate Case, and, obviously, it's dragged on longer than we had anticipated. And so it actually has not been reflected in our rates yet. So as a result, from a cash flow perspective, that's been a slight negative. And so those, I would say, are somewhat offsetting, and that's one of the reasons why we're very comfortable still with our $800 million to $1 billion range.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Excellent. And then if you could elaborate for a second. On transmission, obviously, you have TO15 in the bag. You're looking at the TO16. If you could -- as you're thinking about the resolution of that case and looking forward in the context of the latest decision in New England, has that changed your thinking at all? And how do you think about the median versus midpoint methodology that I suppose nominally is still out there?","Kent M. Harvey","Well, we do believe that the policy at the FERC is in transition. And I think in the New England case, the decision indicates that mechanically applying the DCF model has some shortcomings and that you do need to consider, for example, anomalies in the market and that the ultimate result should be reasonable. So based on that, we're hopeful that we can expect a little bit more flexibility than we've seen in the past. But it's still early on.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Excellent. And then lastly, in your comments, you've mentioned a couple times the impact of hydro. Are you seeing much in terms of your own portfolio? And then specifically, as you think about customer inflation, et cetera, I mean, how much of an impact could -- does this have this year and, more importantly, could this have in subsequent years as you're seeing it?","Christopher P. Johns","Yes, Julien, this is Chris. In the last -- this last year has been third driest hydro season in the last 119 years. And so what we've seen is an increase in the need to use the marketplace to obtain power for our customers during parts of the season. We still have enough hydro to really hit at the extreme parts and use that to offset costs. But what that has resulted in, in conjunction also with some of the rising gas prices is, is that we're seeing higher costs for electricity here. And so, obviously, that will have an upward pressure on our rates with our customers either later this year or into next year. Depending on timing, we may just put it in as part of our next year annual true-up if it doesn't get too high.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. But I don't sense any over-worry about what that might do to end user rates. It's probably...","Christopher P. Johns","We're, obviously, always concerned about our customers' rates and any impact on it, but we have this in the General Rate Case. And all of that we're trying to consider together, what that looks like to our customers.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","On the $0.10 that you have now offset with the transmission revenues and the SolarCity monetization, can you split that out between the 2?","Kent M. Harvey","I'd just say in terms of the SolarCity monetization it was worth a few cents during the quarter, and I think -- the gas transmission revenue is more of a gradual thing during the year.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And I guess on the SolarCity thing, it -- that's -- whatever your stake is, it's not enough to meaningfully kind of impact on the cash side your financing needs?","Kent M. Harvey","No, it's not a huge driver from a cash perspective.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And then maybe just on the San Bruno proposed decision, I assume you've gotten no indication of when the ALJs may issue a proposed decision?","Anthony F. Earley","Yes, that's correct, Steve. Anything we'd say will be speculation. But as I said, the record has been closed now for 10 months, and we certainly are hoping to get a decision sometime in the near future.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And just -- could you maybe just talk a bit little more operationally how you're doing on your kind of overall electric gas reliability this year, also on your pressure testing and all your other work?","Christopher P. Johns","Yes, this is Chris. On the electric side, we are in the midst of a sixth straight year of record-setting reliability for PG&E. We continue to make the appropriate investments, and we're seeing great results in terms of reducing the number of outages and then the duration of those outages. And then on the gas side, we continue to do unparalleled work. We're testing more pipes, replacing more pipe, putting in more valves, validating the maximum allowable operating procedure than anybody in the country right now, and that continues to move along very well. We do our periodic updates of our PSEP program, and we're on schedule. There's a couple of projects, smaller ones, that may still slip into 2015. But otherwise, we're comfortable that we're on track.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Curious. So the SolarCity shares, you said you acquired through a tax equity structure. Do you have any other similar investments that have -- maybe might be comparable that you could also monetize?","Kent M. Harvey","Jonathan, this is Kent. I mentioned that the disposition we did in this past quarter was roughly about 1\/3 of our overall holdings. And so in terms of -- there are additional shares SolarCity stock. But other than that, no, I don't see anything comparable in terms of our holdings at the corporation.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, so it's a non -- SolarCity is a sort of a one-off thing actually?","Kent M. Harvey","That's correct.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","If we look out kind of 3 to 5 years, I wonder if you can give us the landscape for renewable energy development right now on the electric side, in your service territory. And then second to that, with the other opportunities, whether it's transmission, distribution, even owning some renewable generation, what that outlook looks like and growth opportunities there.","Anthony F. Earley","Well, I'll start off and then maybe Chris can follow up on some of the details. But we are very optimistic and have said repeatedly we will hit the State goal of 33% renewables by 2020. We're in the high 20% range now, and we've done a lot of hard work to figure out how to integrate those renewables into the system. Many of you have seen the famous or infamous duck curve that's out there, and our folks have done a lot of work on figuring how to manage the system where we have renewables coming in that we don't control that depend upon whether the wind is blowing or the sun is out. And I'm really pleased with operationally how we are managing this, and I see the ability to get to that 33% number. Chris, you want to comment on opportunities we see in transmission and other things?","Christopher P. Johns","Yes, as we move forward, we don't see ourselves investing in any renewables in any time in the future. But they will still come online, and we'll do most of that through contracting. I think as you look down the road and you look where the industry is headed, obviously, we need to continue to modernize our infrastructure both on the transmission side and on the distributor side for electric and making sure that we're able to accommodate all the new rooftop solar panels, the storage that's going to come online at some point, electric vehicles. And all of those things continue to provide us with opportunities to upgrade and modernize the system. And so although we have not given any guidance as to what our CapEx looks like beyond this year and what you've seen in the proposals for our GT&S case and our GRC, we know that we're got an older infrastructure and it needs upgraded, and we'll continue to do that so that we can make sure our customers can handle their energy needs in the way they'd like.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And you piqued my interest. What are some of the ways that you guys are managing that duck curve?","Anthony F. Earley","Well, it's a whole range of strategies. One is more accurate forecasting. So we've been developing models that give us a better idea of what to expect day-to-day. We're also working with a number of the suppliers. We conduct a periodic bidding process to get new renewables as we gradually work our way up to 33%. And more and more, we are trying to incorporate in those contracts the ability to curtail production when we don't need it so we can manage the matching of the demand with the available electricity.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just I want to touch base on things that when we get past this General Rate Case and past the GT&S case won't necessarily be recovered in the rate structure until kind of the next round of either GRC or GT&S rate cases. Can you just kind of refresh us on what those items are expected to be?","Kent M. Harvey","Michael, this is Kent. In terms of the General Rate Case, Tony indicated based on the proposed decision we are -- assuming it is approved in the final form, we do intend to earn our authorized return overall for those lines of business. So I don't think there's anything significant in the General Rate Case portion of our business where there's any significant unrecovery. I mentioned there's a small piece of our capital true-up for 2013. It's probably a couple of hundred million dollars that isn't reflected in the proposed decision rate base for 2014, so that's capital from before this year. But we did have a significant true-up request in that case, and the large majority of it is reflected in the proposed decision. In terms of the Gas Transmission & Storage Case, there's really just a few items that going in we did not seek recovery. Of course, the most significant one is our rights-of-way program that Chris talked about earlier on the call, and we expect that to continue through 2017, so we have a few more years of that. There's only 2 other smaller items that we didn't seek recovery of, much smaller in scale. And we said together, they're roughly $50 million a year for the 3-year GT&S rate case period. One has to do with pressure testing on newer pipe, and the other one has to do with a portion of our corrosion work, which we believe was more remedial in nature. So those are really the items I think that address your question.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And the pressure -- is it the combination of the rights-of-way and the pressure testing and corrosion? Is all of that $50 million or just the pressure testing and the corrosion? And then, therefore, how much is the rights-of-way on top of that?","Kent M. Harvey","It's the latter. In other words, roughly $50 million a year on average during the 3-year period is the pressure testing and the corrosion work. The rights-of-way work, as you know, is a 5-year program, and we believe that it will come in at or less than $500 million. So I would say really simplistically you could assume on average roughly $100 million a year.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And all of that is pretax?","Kent M. Harvey","That's correct.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Last question. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in overall demand trends in Northern California relative to what your expectations for weather-normalized demand trends? What's differing? How -- and what are your kind of views on what happens to electricity demand going forward over the next couple of years, like what you think the new normal for weather-normal demand is in Northern California?","Thomas E. Bottorff","This is Tom Bottorff. The forecasts that we filed recently in regulatory proceedings suggest an increase of about 0.3% per year going forward for several years. That could, obviously, change in future years as we learn more about the deployment of DICHI [ph] and other technologies, but that's the weather-normalized forecast for foreseeable future.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Kent, when it relates to the pipeline-related expenses, how much insurance claim do you guys have in backlog that is prospectively available for recovery still?","Kent M. Harvey","Well, I'll give you a kind of all the kind of insurance numbers across the board so you can kind of understand it. In terms of our accrual, we've accrued $565 million. In terms of the actual cash outlay we've made, it's a little over $530 million, so the vast majority has actually been paid out in cash. We have incurred legal expenses related to third-party claims, which is also recoverable from insurance, which totals $88 million. And our recoveries to date on insurance are $354 million, I think, is the number. So there's still a couple hundred million dollars just in terms of getting up to our accrual, and then there's also $88 million in legal expenses incurred to date.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And from an effective perspective, you guys have been funding that shortfall with equity just to keep your capital structure balanced, correct?","Kent M. Harvey","That's correct. The after tax amount with equity, yes.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, can you guys just maybe give a couple of thoughts -- I know it's early -- but on 111 (d) and how that could, a, integrate with AB 32; and then, b, assuming there's a bit of a penalty for people who've done a lot of work in advance, which you guys have, how does that affect maybe how you guys comment or make future planning decisions?","Anthony F. Earley","Yes, let me start. I think we are in good shape under 111(d). We are still though trying to sort out how it will impact the California Cap and Trade regime. It's been working successfully. And that's an issue we've been talking to the California Air Resources Board, working with EPA. But by and large, our take on that is that PG&E is in very good shape given our current mix of generation. Not only do we have over half of our generation now is -- on nonemitting sources, when you include Diablo Canyon and our large hydro plants plus the renewables that qualify under the California program, that's going to go to 65% by 2020. And our own utility-owned generation are almost brand-new combined-cycle plants that have been built in the last 4 or 5 years, so they're pretty much state-of-the-art, so we feel like we're in good shape. But, obviously, we've got to get understandings of how all these things are going to integrate, and it's really too early to tell.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And is there anything update-wise on kind of the process for looking at some of these net metering changes and how you guys are coming along with recalibrating rate structures and demand charges?","Thomas E. Bottorff","Yes, this is Tom Bottorff. The commission did issue a proceeding this month that would launch a new rule-making to look at how the net metering tier should be revised, and they have a timeline for resolving that by the end of 2015, so -- and it would become effective in the middle of 2017. So that proceeding has been launched. They have opportunities to comment that are due in the middle of August, but there really isn't a decision anticipated until probably the latter part of 2015.","Operator","The next question comes of the line of Kit Konolige with BGC.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Just -- most of my questions have been asked and answered. Just on the superseding indictment. Do you have any sense of how long that process is going to take to play out? And is there any possibility of a settlement? I guess I'm starting from the assumption that if you didn't settle before the indictment that settling after the indictment may not be in the cards. But I'd like any sense you can give us of where we stand, how long it'll take and what ultimately might occur.","Hyun Park","So this is Hyun Park, General Counsel. The timeframe, I think, is it could take 1 or 2 or more years, but the schedule just has not been set yet. And in terms of settlement possibilities, I would say at this point there have been no settlement discussions. But, obviously, as Chris mentioned earlier, we're always open to receive [ph] offers.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Right. And just -- not that it probably matters a whole lot at this point, but why does the U.S. Attorney issue a superseding indictment like that? I mean, what -- was there something that came out in -- during year 4 that had an impact on what the indictments look like? What -- did they know anything later that they didn't know before? Or was it just a matter of they discovered some new law books? Or how does that work?","Hyun Park","Yes, so I don't think it's completely uncommon for prosecutors to commend and occasionally file a superseding indictment. But as we see the superseding indictment, we don't think that any new facts have emerged. I mean it looks like it's more or less pretty much the same types of issues. There are 28 counts that are now in the indictment, and one relates to the obstruction charge that Tony described earlier. And there are 27 other counts, and they all relate to the same type of issues that were in the original indictment. There's a new code section that's referenced that relates to pressure testing records, but it looks like it's more of the same type of issues.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Okay, fine. I have one last unrelated question. And that is with the -- on the gas transmission retroactive decision by the commission is -- how much of a change -- is that a change in policy? Or was that something you expected? Does that apply to future filings in gas transmission or other areas?","Thomas E. Bottorff","Yes, this is Tom Bottorff. This practice is generally fairly common in these kinds of proceedings, but you do have to initiate a request with each proceeding, so it's not automatic, but we've gotten similar treatment in our General Rate Cases. We requested it in this TTF [ph] case and received it. So my expectation -- should it be our expectation that decisions will be delayed in the future, we will make a request to continue to ensure that they're retroactive to the date that we requested.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","And would you take this as an indication that the commission would be of a mind to go along with your request to -- for retroactive treatment?","Thomas E. Bottorff","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on some of the questions regarding the superseding indictment. You mentioned that there had been no effort to enter into settlement discussions. I would like to know what are the consequences of a conviction? Are there consequences for your ability to recover under your insurance policies? Are there consequences for your ability to continue to provide services under some of your franchise agreements? Can you explore the possible negative consequences of a conviction?","Christopher P. Johns","Sure. So I think with respect to the 2 specific questions that you mentioned with respect to insurance, our ability to serve our customers, I think the answer is we don't think a negative consequence in the criminal indictment will have a negative impact on those 2 issues. And I can't remember, what was the third question that you asked?","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Well, if there are no serious commercial implications of a conviction, what was the thinking that got you to engage in settlement discussions? It seems to me that this is a potentially very large penalty, which will create uncertainty for a period of years. It almost replicates the environment that we've been in for the last 2 years on the San Bruno CPUC penalty. Would there not be a strong incentive to try to put this behind you as well earlier rather than later?","Anthony F. Earley","Yes, let me comment on it. This is Tony. Of course, we've only seen the superseding indictment here a day or so. If you'll recall the original indictment, the 12 counts amounted to $6 million, so we've just got this larger amount that we have to look at. We still believe, as Hyun said, the new indictment doesn't really allege any new facts. And in the past, he said we've looked at this, and we've admitted in other proceedings that the company may have been negligent, and in fact, that's how we settled all of the civil cases. But there's no evidence that we've seen that somebody willfully and knowingly violated the Pipeline Safety Act. So first of all, it's difficult to admit to something you just have no evidence that would support that. Second, there's a difference between how a conviction -- so a conviction in federal court has a different standard. And if we admitted that we have willfully and knowingly violated that Pipeline Safety Act, and that could have had consequences in the ongoing proceedings that we have. So given those facts, we've decided that we just can't see that we should admit to violations of those proceedings -- of those acts.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jim von Reisemann with CRT Capital.","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","I could use a bit of a math tutorial, if you don't mind. So do you have any general understanding directionally as to how the U.S. Attorney calculated this $281 million gain they allege you made from the San Bruno incident even though you said you haven't seen any sort of specifics? And the second question is in the event there is a guilty verdict, is there a potential for insurance recovery clawbacks? And what I'm getting at there in the second question is, how does the math actually work here, meaning is the investment community possibly double-counting, meaning that you might get credit for settlements already reached? Or for lack of a better word, could there actually be some sort of double jeopardy, meaning that if you've already paid out the third-party settlements for this $565 million, exclusive of these insurance recoveries, would you still be obligated to pay, say, 2 times the $565 million so the dollar amount is actually significantly higher than what the U.S. Attorney is saying?","Anthony F. Earley","Well, Jim, I'll start off here. We don't know how they were calculated because all of this is one line at the end of the indictment that these are the numbers for the gain and here's the number for the losses caused. So we'd be just speculating on how those numbers were calculated. Hyun, in terms of mechanically how this works?","Hyun Park","So as I said in --at I think, the last earnings call, to get to the alternative fine, there are a number of hurdles that the prosecutors have to overcome. They have to prove the criminal act beyond a reasonable doubt, and then they have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that, that criminal conduct caused the loss or the gain; and then, they also have to prove the amount of the loss or the gain beyond a reasonable doubt. They also have to try to prove that the alternative fine would not unduly complicate or prolong the sentencing process. And we're just not aware of any situation where an alternative fine was based on the amounts paid to settle personal injury fees. So I think it just remains to be seen how the prosecutors are going to try to demonstrate the link of the $281 million in gain or the $565 million that they have referenced in their indictment. And the $281 million, I just don't know where they came up with that.","Operator","The next question comes the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just want to know if you could provide sort of a range in the amount of deferred taxes you think you'd book in 2015 and maybe '16. I know previously you said you don't expect to be a cash taxpayer in '14 and I guess for most of, I believe, '15. And I guess you go back to paying taxes in '16. I wonder if you could give a range? And also, lastly, do your rate base assumptions include deferred taxes and bonus depreciation in there?","Dinyar B. Mistry","This is Dinyar Mistry, the Controller. Previously, we had said that we are in an NOL position, so we don't expect to pay cash taxes in 2014, possibly going into 2015. We have looked at our range of deferred taxes, and they're embedded in the rate base forecasts that are in the slides that we've given you. So all of those numbers are already implied in the rate base and in the equity numbers that we have provided for 2014.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza from Citigroup.","Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A little bit more of an obscure question. Most of my other questions were answered. When you -- there's some chatter and headlines that we've seen where Mexico may join CAISO's imbalanced market. Kind of wondering if whether you've done any work on what the potential impact could be for reliability as well as any opportunities that you can come about from additional transmission build?","Anthony F. Earley","Well, I think that's a new one for -- we've not heard that Mexico's going to join that imbalanced market. So I can't answer the question about impacts.","Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. I'll follow up offline on that. And just one last question. Is there still any chatter or any kind of a push to increase the RPS standard above what it is currently by 2020?","Anthony F. Earley","Well, there have been questions of so what do we do next after we get to 2020. It also gets wrapped up in what happens with the 111 (d) things that EPA is working on. And here in California, I mean, we've had some discussions among the utilities and some of the State folks around clean energy standards rather than renewable energy standards, but it's all still in a formative status of discussion right now.","Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, got it. And currently, as far as the net metering cap, can you just remind us what the cap is and whether you can potentially surpass that at a new point?","Kent M. Harvey","Yes. They give the cap as currently at 5%. We don't anticipate it being surpassed before 2016. There's some uncertainty about when it could occur, but our guess is 2016 to 2017.","Operator","The next question comes of the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My questions have been asked and answered.","Sara A. Cherry","Is there one more question?","Operator","Yes, the next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium.","Ashar Khan","Yes, I just -- Kent, just a small question. What would be the share count at the end of the year based on your current share issuance program?","Kent M. Harvey","That one's going to depend on the price and stuff like that. So I'll just tell you the average shares in Q2 were 469 million.","Ashar Khan","The average. And what were they at the end of the year, end of the quarter? Do you have that?","Kent M. Harvey","Well, I only have the Q1 average, which was 460 million in Q1. That was the average share count. I don't have the end of the quarter.","Sara A. Cherry","Okay, great. Thanks, Josh. Thanks, everyone. I think we'll wrap it up. Thanks for participating today, and please don't hesitate to call us if you have any follow-up questions. And have a wonderful day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for attending the PG&E Corporation Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This now concludes the conference.
