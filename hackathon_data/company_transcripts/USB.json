Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the conference call over to Jen Thompson of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.","Jen Thompson","Thank you, Melissa and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Terry Dolan Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's third quarter results and to answer your questions. Richard and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at USBank.com.","I'd like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page 2 of today's presentation and our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.","I'll now turn the call over to Richard.","Richard Davis","Thanks, Jen. Good morning, everybody and thanks for joining our call. I'd like to begin our review of U.S. Bank's results with a summary of the quarter's highlights on page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $1.5 billion for the third quarter of 2016 or a record $0.84 per diluted common share. I'm very pleased with the third quarter results. Industry-leading profitability was supported by solid loan and deposit growth and broad-based core revenue growth.","As a reminder, our prior quarter results included notable items including a Visa gain of $180 million in noninterest income and $150 million related to litigation accruals and a charitable contribution in noninterest expense. There were no notable items to report in the third quarter. So for the remainder of this call, we will discuss the results on a core basis excluding the notable second quarter items I just described, as this is how we believe the investment community looks at our results.","Slide 4 provides you with a five-quarter history of our profitability metrics which continue to be among the best in the industry. In the third quarter, our return on average common equity was 13.5% and our efficiency ratio was 54.5%.","Turning to slide 5, the Company reported total net revenue of $5.4 billion in the third quarter. Excluding notable items in the second quarter of 2016, this represents an increase of 2.3% on a linked quarter basis. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by loan growth of 1.1% and strength in a number of our fee-based businesses, including mortgage banking and Payment Services. The industry continues to face headwinds from the low rate environment and a flatter yield curve.","This quarter, our net interest margin was also impacted by higher levels of cash balances due to the strong deposit inflows. However, despite our lower net interest margin, which declined by 4 basis points to 2.98%, in line with expectations, we reported net interest income growth both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. Credit quality was stable in the third quarter as expected. Both nonperforming assets and net charge-offs decreased modestly compared with the prior linked quarter.","Before turning to Terry, I'll provide you with an outlook for the fourth quarter. Currently, we expect average loans to continue to grow in the range of 1% to 1.5% sequentially. While mortgage loan growth is expected to slow in line with industrywide tapering of refinancing activity and due to seasonality, we look for a rebound in commercial loan growth in the fourth quarter and expect strength in consumer loans to continue.","Given the current shape of the yield curve, we expect that the net interest margin will decline a couple of basis points. However, we expect net interest income will increase on a linked quarter basis, principally driven by growth in earning assets. We look for somewhat lower mortgage revenue in the fourth quarter, in line with an expectation of lower refinancing activity. We expect expenses to grow 2.5% on a linked quarter basis, primarily driven by seasonally higher expenses including tax credit amortization costs related to our community development business.","And finally, given the underlying mix and quality of the overall portfolio, we expect credit quality to remain relatively stable and we expect the provision to increase in line with loan growth. Terry will now provide you with more details about our third quarter results.","Terry Dolan","Thanks, Richard. I'll start on slide 6 which highlights our loan and deposit growth. Average total loans outstanding grew 1.1% on a linked quarter basis and increased 7.6% compared with the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the retail card portfolio acquisitions completed in the second half of last year and student loans that were reclassified to held-for-investment in the third quarter of 2015, loans grew by 6.4% compared to the prior year. In the third quarter, the year-over-year increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 9.0% and strong growth in average total residential mortgage loans of 8.6%. ","Consumer loan growth was broad-based, led by credit card loans and other retail loans. Specifically, credit card loans grew 5.9%, excluding the retail card acquisition; and other retail loans grew 5.2%, excluding the student loans. Home equity loans grew 2.4% on a year-over-year basis, with growth primarily sourced from our branch network. On a linked quarter basis, our average loan growth was 1.1%, in line with our expectations. Credit card loans grew 2.4%; residential mortgage loans grew 1.4%; home equity loans were up 0.5%; and other retail loans were up 2.7%.","Total average deposits increased by more than $28 billion or 10% compared with the third quarter of 2015 and were up 3.6% on a linked quarter basis. On a year-over-year basis, the trend reflected strong growth of 11.9% in our low-cost deposits, which includes our non-interest-bearing deposits and our interest-bearing savings deposits. This strong core deposit growth more than offset the runoff in higher-cost time deposits.","Turning to slide 7, credit quality remained relatively stable in the third quarter. Third quarter net charge-offs increased by $23 million or 7.9% compared with the prior year, but decreased by $2 million compared with the second quarter of 2016. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans were 46 basis points in the third quarter, unchanged from the prior year and down from the 48 basis points reported in the linked quarter. Compared with a year ago, nonperforming assets increased $97 million or 6.2%, mostly due to downgrades that occurred in the prior quarters related to energy credit. Linked quarter, nonperforming assets decreased by $8 million or less than 1%, primarily driven mainly from improvements in residential mortgages and other real estate. We continued to add to the allowance for loan losses in the third quarter, in line with loan growth.","Slide 8 provides highlights of third quarter results versus comparable periods. Third quarter net income increased by $13 million or 0.9% on a year-over-year basis, net revenue growth was partially offset by higher noninterest expense. As Richard mentioned, results in the prior quarter were impacted by notable items, including a $180 million Visa gain in noninterest income and $150 million in noninterest expenses related to litigation accruals and a charitable contribution. Excluding notable items from the second quarter, net income increased by $2 million or 0.1%, reflecting total net revenue growth of 2.3%, offset by noninterest expense growth of 3.1%. Our efficiency ratio of 54.5% was in line with our guidance of 54% to 54.9%.","Turning to slide 9, net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis increased by $122 million or 4.3% compared with the prior year. Strong average earning asset growth was offset somewhat by the impact of a 6 basis point decline in the net interest margin to 2.98%. The year-over-year decline in the net interest margin primarily reflected increased funding cost, higher average cash balances, and lower rates on securities purchases partially offset by higher rates on new loans.","Compared with the second quarter of 2016, taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $47 million or 1.6%. Growth in average total loans was offset by a 4 basis point decrease in the net interest margin. The linked quarter decline in the margin primarily reflects the impact of higher cash balances which represented 3 out of the 4 basis point decline, as well as lower average rates on securities purchased, offset somewhat by the benefit of higher LIBOR rates on loans during the quarter.","Slide 10 highlights trends in noninterest income which increased $119 million or 5.1% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to growth in mortgage banking revenue, trust and investment management fees, credit and debit card revenue and merchant processing revenue.","Mortgage banking revenue increased $90 million or 40.2%, supported by core growth and strong industrywide refinancing activity which drove originations and sales volume. Trust and investment management fees increased $33 million or 10%, reflecting lower money market fee waivers, growth in assets under management and improved equity markets. A $30 million or 11.2% increase in credit and debit card revenue was driven by higher transaction volumes, including the acquired portfolios. Merchant processing revenue increased $12 million or 3%. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, merchant processing revenue increased 5.3% from the prior year.","On a linked quarter basis, noninterest income increased $73 million or 3.1%. The increase was principally due to stronger mortgage banking revenue and growth in payment services revenue. Mortgage banking revenue increased $76 million or 31.9% which slightly exceeded our previous guidance range of 20% to 30%. Growth in mortgage banking revenue was driven by higher production volumes, reflecting stronger refinancing activity. Mortgage banking revenue was also supported by a favorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights net of hedging activities.","Corporate payment products revenue increased by $9 million or 5.0%. And as a reminder, corporate payment products revenue is seasonally stronger in the third quarter of each year. Merchant processing revenue increased $9 million or 2.2% due to seasonally higher transaction volumes. Excluding the impact of foreign currency changes, merchant processing revenue would have increased by 3.5% sequentially. Commercial product revenue decreased by $19 million or 8.0%, primarily due to higher capital markets volume in the second quarter which in turn reflected market volatility during that quarter.","Turning to slide 11, noninterest expense increased $156 million or 5.6% on a year-over-year basis. Compensation expense grew versus the prior year, primarily due to hiring decisions to support business growth and compliance programs, as well as the impact of merit increases and variable compensation tied to production.","Professional services increased $12 million or 10.4%, also reflecting costs associated with compliance programs. Technology and communication expense increased $21 million or 9.5%, including the impact of capital investments and costs related to the acquired credit card portfolios. We continue our investment in our brand which is reflected in slightly higher marketing costs from a year ago.","On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense increased $89 million or 3.1%. Compensation expense increased $52 million or 4.1%, due to the impact of one additional day in the quarter and increased staffing. The $23 million increase or 5.1%, in other noninterest expense primarily reflected seasonally higher costs related to investments in tax-advantaged projects and the impact of the FDIC surcharge which began in the third quarter of 2016. Marketing and business development costs decreased $7 million or 6.4% due to the timing of various marketing programs.","As Richard mentioned, we expect expenses to grow in the fourth quarter, however at a slower pace than the 3.1% growth that we recorded in the third quarter. Our current expectation is for linked quarter expenses to grow by 2.5% in the fourth quarter. This is primarily due to seasonal expenses, including tax credit amortization costs which we expect will increase on a linked quarter basis approximately $60 million during the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we realize the benefit of these tax credits in our tax rate.","The linked quarter decline in preferred dividends was reflective of our fourth quarter 2015 preferred stock issuance which has a semiannual dividend payment. As a result of that issuance, we will have higher quarterly dividends in quarters 2 and 4 of every year, compared with quarters 1 and 3.","Turning to slide 12, our capital position remains strong; and in the third quarter we returned 79% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We expect to remain in our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 80% going forward.","Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, estimated using the Basel III Standardized Approach as if fully implemented at September 30, was 9.3% which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to $18.85 at September 30, representing a 9.6% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 2.1% increase over the prior quarter.","I will now turn it back to Richard.","Richard Davis","Thanks, Terry. I'm very proud of our record third quarter results. We maintained our industry-leading performance measures and we reported an 18.1% return on tangible common equity in the quarter.","Our industry continues to face challenges from the low interest rate environment. However, we remain confident that we can continue to grow revenue even as we prudently manage expenses and strategically invest in our businesses to create value for both our customers and for our shareholders.","That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Terry, Bill and I would be happy to answer any of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Ricky Dodds","This is Ricky Dodds from Matt's team. I've got a quick question on C&I loan growth. It's a little weaker than we expected and I was wondering if you could provide us any color on what's driving the slowdown at USB?","Richard Davis","Yes. I'll go first, Ricky and I'll turn it over to Andy. As we\u2019ve said, I think, at our Investor Day five weeks ago, we think quarter 3 represents a pause in C&I lending, meaning that it was strong in quarter 2 and we expect it to recover in quarter 4, in part based on what we believe is the vagaries of quarter 3 where we had some of the Brexit activities moved things up into quarter 2 and perhaps some of the uncertainty around election and other things moving things into quarter 4, but we see that returning nonetheless.","You'll see that we had a particularly across-the-board performance in most of the corporate space as the slowdown reflected things like higher paydowns, reduction in deal activity. And a healthy capital market condition allowed some borrowers to use the debt markets, although we also captured some of that in our capital markets activity.","The rest of the lending, though, on the consumer side, remained strong and in fact got stronger as the year progresses, and we continue to see that progressing into quarter 4 as well. But for a little color around commercial and CRE, maybe we'll have Andy give you that.","Andy Cecere","So another factor was a little lower utilization rate. We were down maybe 75 basis points from 26 to 25.25 this quarter, and this is reflective of some of the things Richard talked about. Again I think the very strong debt capital markets issuance that we saw in the second quarter and early in the third quarter impacted Bank outstandings, as we talked about.","And finally M&A activity which was a driver of strong growth in prior quarters, took a little bit of a pause here in the third quarter, either delayed or deferred to future quarters. So those factors all come into play and that's why we think it was more of a pause and that will come back a little bit as we [indiscernible].","Richard Davis","I just might add, it's already October, what is it, 19th? And so we're deep into the fourth quarter, and we have a pretty good idea how the annuities look, so we can see growth certainly over quarter 3. It's how strong it gets in the next couple of weeks; we'll be able to reflect at the next conference.","Operator","Your next question is from John McDonald with Bernstein.","John McDonald","I wanted to ask about expenses and efficiency, Richard. Where are you on the ongoing effort to kind of improve productivity and expenses but also keep investing? Is it a goal to try to self-fund your expenses and investments with savings elsewhere? Or is it more about an efficiency ratio mindset?","Richard Davis","Yes, so you know, John, we don't measure efficiency ratio. It becomes the result of the fraction of revenues-to-expenses. So the best way to keep it low is to do more revenue which is our number-one goal. Expense-wise, I think we've telegraphed to you all that we appreciate that the higher cost of compliance and actually some of the capital expenditures we've been making in innovation technology continued to bear down on expenses.","So I will continue to let expenses grow only to the level that revenue is allowing it under the circumstances that we set forth at the Investor Day which is that we think there will be a couple of nominal rate increases in 2017. With those rate increases, we made a commitment to you all, based on what we can see today to provide slightly positive operating leverage in this environment. We also said, however, if those rates don't materialize, it will be much harder for us to do that. To give you a sense of it, without the rates, a couple of rate increases in the next year, that for us is hundreds of millions of dollars in expenses that we would need to reduce further and I think would probably cut into some of the muscle of the Company's long-term objectives for growth and innovation.","So we're not going to make that commitment at this stage, but we'll watch every nickel and dime. I always find a need to pause and remind you guys, to be in the 54%s isn't, like, easy. We don't sit there and we watch every nickel and dime and we have efficiency programs all over the Company. One of the ways we've kept it low is that we continue to get better every day. We take innovation and we let technology make it more efficient for our Company and for our people and therefore better service, but it's not easy. So we do have expense programs all the time, every day and forever.","Some of the companies I know that announced efficiency programs, they put names around them, they give you dollar amounts; we don't do that because it's not our style. We also don't need to. But we do watch it every single day. So we will let revenue be the dictate in most cases to how well that efficiency ratio performs. Our goal is to have it continue to be in the mid-50%s and for a while. At that point, we'll measure against a future that I think won't be starved for investment. At the same token, the minute things get better and we have every opportunity to save a dollar, we will do that very thing and give you a better return.","John McDonald","Just on the topic of rates, I was hoping to ask Terry if he could flesh out a little bit of the outlook on the NIM that you gave for next quarter. What are some of the puts and takes, the good guys and bad guys affecting the NIM outlook for next quarter? And if you could include there, what's your guess as to the effect that one Fed rate hike would have on your NIM in the quarter afterwards? Thanks.","Andy Cecere","Sure. Incorporated into our guidance, we're assuming that the rate hike does occur in the December time frame; and that in and of itself would have a positive impact with respect to margin, probably maybe by a basis point or so. But one of the things that we anticipate, John, is that the cash balances that we saw an increase in, in the third quarter, we think are tied to money market reform. And that is going to have an impact in terms of net interest margin at least probably through the fourth quarter.","We anticipate that it's going to be transitory and that those cash balances will start to dissipate as people get more comfortable with money market reform, but when we guide that the net interest margin is going to be down a couple of basis points, the cash balances are going to have an impact on that.","John McDonald","And Terry, just to clarify, the one basis point NIM help, is that for the quarter that -- if it happened in December you would get that help this quarter? And would there be a carrythrough to the next quarter that's a little bigger than that?","Terry Dolan","Yes.","Richard Davis","Yes and yes.","Operator","Your next question is from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.","John Pancari","Back to the loan growth topic, thanks for the color that you've given in terms of near term trends; and I hear you in terms of some of the inconsistencies around borrower demand amid the uncertainty right now. How does that play into your expectation for how you're looking at 2017? I know you don't yet have guidance and there for loan growth. But I want to get an idea if you continue to expect improvement coming out of fourth quarter through 2017 and generally expect a higher level of loan growth. Thanks.","Richard Davis","The answer is yes. We've been in that range of 1% to 1.5% for a long, long time. Every quarter is different and yet we've found a way to pretty much stay there and I think you can count on that to be a forerunner for the future. When revenue is -- or when growth is strong in retail, it might be stressed in commercial; but this is a really well bifurcated model we have here. We like C&I, we like CRE, we like all consumer categories; but we see actually a little slightly stronger 2017 than 2016 based on nothing more than the fact that the world gets better a little bit, slowly but surely and because we're taking market share.","I haven't talked about market share in a number of quarters, because I know it's a hollow category when all banks are doing well and everybody talks about it, but you know, we really are -- $28 billion in deposits in one year, the kind of loan growth we've had consistently, 10% commercial loan growth year-over-year, we're taking market share. And part of that, John, is also a proxy for next year, because we believe that market share momentum not only continues but it gets stronger. ","When anybody in our environment -- think of the foreign banks or think of other banks that go through any period of stress -- we get the benefit of that. And as long as we continue to be -- if we're not their first customer, we're their first choice after that particular bank they're with, that's going to be a really good way for us to grow the business. So next year it's across-the-board. We expect to be strong in virtually every category. Look at our home equity. We continue to grow home equity and it's not with smoke and mirrors.","We do it the old-fashioned way with really good products and really good branch-based products coming out of the branch employees. That's something that is really quite a difference from most of the companies that we compete with. So we can do it across-the-board and we like all the categories. So I think quarter 4 will continue to be in that range. I think next year will be in that range and maybe slightly positive bias to that.","John Pancari","Then separately, I guess this would be a question for you as well, would be around the regulatory side. Since we've been talking about the regulatory expenses that you've been putting in the work, can you give us a related update on the BSA\/AML progress and if there's any way to help us with expectations of when that could be resolved? Thanks.","Richard Davis","Yes, sure, John. We're deep in the middle of it, so I not only don't have a projection of when we'll leave, if I had it I wouldn't tell you because of the regulators. I haven't made any agreements. So that will take a while; it will definitely be well into next year that we'll get a line of sight on when we can look for an exit of that. In the meantime, it's taken us to a compliance cost level that I had hoped to recover when we got out of the mortgage consent order which we're now long out of. But as it turns out, when the AML Consent Order came in, it's virtually replaced those same costs.","So with our growth expectation of reducing expenses, we're unable to do that at this point. But it's also finding its way now into the run rate of the Company. It's also made us a better bank. I don't like Consent Orders and we only have the one and it's frustrating to me. But the fact of the matter is it's a proxy for the expectations of zero tolerance for errors and we've aligned that proxy with everything we do. It takes a little bit of time to adjust to it. It takes a little bit more money to get your first, second and third lines to do amazing levels of oversight and quality assurance.","But once and when you've done that and you've put it into your run rate, both in costs and the way you do business, we'll be a better bank for it. So I would like you to think that the AML project has extended itself through the whole Company to improve our compliance capability and therefore fend off any other future areas of shortcomings. And I would say next year we'll be able to give you a better line of sight; but at this stage, we're deep in the middle of it, doing our very best job to satisfy the regulators and to overperform even to our own expectations. And at this point, I'd be hesitant to give you any kind of an exit timetable.","Operator","Your next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","I had a question on the fee side of things. Terry, you mentioned that mortgage would be down in the fourth; and you talked about into the quarter how it would have a nice leap. I'm just wondering. It looked like the gain on sale margin was quite high. I'm calculating 150. Can you walk us through the mix of refi versus purchase and what you're expecting in general for mortgage to do in the fourth quarter?","Andy Cecere","Sure. If you end up looking at the third quarter versus, for example, the second quarter, just to address your question related to the mix of refinancings, in the second quarter the mix was about 65% to 70% on the purchase side; and the rest of it was refinance, so let's say 35%. It was closer to 45% during the third quarter and we would expect that that refinancing mix will probably decline closer to 40% in the fourth quarter.","So it is coming down based upon what we're seeing. You are right that when you end up looking at the mix of where a lot of that refinancing is coming from, it's coming from high-quality product, again primarily sourced -- probably a higher mix through our retail banking system.","So when you end up looking at the gain on sale in that margin, we're seeing in the third quarter a better margin than what we had experienced in the past. So the growth that we saw in the third quarter is a mix of higher production as well as higher margin. So you're right on.","Ken Usdin","Can you help us triangulate that to what kind of delta? You helped us understand the 20% to 30% up in the third; does that roll back off in the fourth or is it somewhere in the middle?","Andy Cecere","Yes, I would say that it's probably somewhere in the middle, again, simply because of where the production is going to come from. When you have higher levels of production you're able to get better margins and pricing with respect to the product and therefore better margins as a result. But when we end up looking at the fourth quarter, we do expect the margin on production to be starting to taper a little bit, as well as production levels.","Ken Usdin","A second follow-up, just, Richard, you've made the point about the kind of set-your-clock-to-it seasonality. I was just wondering on the rest of fees generally, do you see just the same type of growth patterns happening as far as the ones that grow and the ones that typically don't? And just your general sense of the ex-mortgage, just fee businesses, any improvements underneath the surface there?","Richard Davis","Yes, I'll let Andy answer that, but I want to tell you, Ken, we're a seasonally strong fourth\/third quarter Company on revenue, also higher expenses in third and fourth quarter because of the CDC. But that's one of the reasons this can look like a consistent predictable outcome, but it's slightly different each time.","Quarter 4 we like a lot for fees and I'll have Andy give you some color around that.","Andy Cecere","Right. The quarter 3 is the strongest quarter for corporate payments and then it tapers off a little bit. If you look at merchant and credit card issuing, I would expect a continued level of growth that you saw this quarter, the same-store sales in that 2%-plus, total revenue in that 3% to 5% like you saw this quarter. So I would see that same expectation, other than corporate payments which does tend to go down in the fourth quarter because third quarter is the strongest given the government activity. Trust fees will be a bit of a function of what the market is doing.","We had a strong quarter this quarter with both strong market activity as well as good core growth. I would expect that to continue. And then Terry made reference to money market reform. We did see quite a shift in our balances also. Our primary funds went down in the neighborhood of $6 billion given money market reform; but our government bonds went up almost $9 billion. So how that settles out will also be impacted with fees here in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Just a follow-up question on John's line of questioning, if I look at the 6% year-over-year increase in expenses in both 2Q and 3Q, Richard, could you help us break it down in terms of how much of that could be attributed to higher compliance costs and risk management costs and how much of that could be attributed to costs to invest for innovation?","Richard Davis","Yes. The breakdown is it's both. Let's start with just year-over-year running the Company this size. Your merit increases alone, say they are 3%, 3%-plus and our total expenses are half compensation. That's 1.5% right there. Number two, I want to make it clear we're spending a lot more in our CapEx in innovation and technology. Gosh, five years ago this Company was at a $400 million, $500 million max annual investment in CapEx; this year, it's going to be between $800 million and $1 billion and our run rate is probably going to be more like $750 million to $800 million.","That's good because it's appropriately -- because we're now more of a technology Company than we used to be. And given our payments leadership, we should be making those kinds of investments which of course will yield value down the line. So that's another piece of it. What's left then is the compensation costs and the overall just running the Company better and spending money on things that we didn't used to spend money on. Like quality assurance which isn't related to the compliance, that's just doing the job better. And making sure our people are paid fairly.","The compensation is entire; it's employee benefits and it's the way we treat the employees and making sure that the culture itself is strong across all categories. And sometimes we have to spend money to make sure that the brand is protected, that the employees feel safe, that the work environment is good. And we're investing in all of those things, too. So compliance is a piece of it, Erika. That 6% is a number I don't want to see over the long course of time.","I'd like it to come down to over a course of time more like a 3% to 5%, because I do think you have to spend money on investments. But that's a little bit high and compliance is probably the delta on that, that 1% to 2% delta that I want to bring down over time in these most current periods. So it's probably a third of it, but it's also a part that won't sustain over the course of a long period of time because once we get it right we'll get the benefits of that. ","Erika Najarian","And just a follow-up question, in terms of Governor Tarullo's speech, it sounds like given that your binding constraint will be the capital conservation buffer. That shouldn't make any difference in terms of how you think about capital planning at your size or the need to scale up to your asset base in order to deal with a higher capital requirement. Am I thinking about that correctly?","Terry Dolan","Yes, so let me take a stab at it and then Andy can add to it. When you end up looking at Tarullo's comments and then the impact to U.S. Bank, we don't really see that it's going to have a significant impact to either our capital distribution plan or the requirements that we have with respect to the minimum requirement. That is because of the fact when you end up looking at the capital depletion that occurs during the stress-testing process that capital depletion for U.S. Bank, given our risk profile, is lower than the 2.5% buffer that is already incorporated into it.","So we think that our minimum requirement from a regulatory perspective is going to continue to be at that 7%. We don't see that technology changing a lot.","Impact to peers? Probably the smaller peers, simply because of the fact that they don't have to deal with some of the qualitative aspects I think will be net positive to them. But we don't see a big change to it. So Andy?","Andy Cecere","And because of that, Terry, our current binding constraint is the standardized ratio under the base case and it will continue to be up.","Operator","Your next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby","You talked a little bit about the shift that was coming in because of the money market change. But deposit growth just continues to outpace loan growth. 10% over the last year for you all is just incredible at this part of the cycle. So why is this? The deposits keep flooding back into the bank balance sheets. Where is the primary source of all that coming from, because it's across-the-board for most banks?","Andy Cecere","Marty, I think one of the principal reasons and both Terry and myself referenced it -- is money market reform. We saw ourselves about a $6 billion decline, some of it going to governments. But the industry saw about $0.5 trillion move out of prime obligation or prime funds. Some of that's moved into bank balance sheets and I think some of that will move back once the investment policies and so forth are adjusted to allow for floating NAV. But that is one of the key factors. I think the other factor is some of the movement between and among banks. Again, given ratings and some of the stresses that are occurring, we're getting a lot of deposits that are flowing to us from some of the non-U.S. banks and that has also been helpful.","Marty Mosby","The other thing, when you look at the mortgage servicing, this was an interesting quarter for mortgage because you had the production go up with refis, but you also had rates trickle up at the back end of the quarter. So your valuation on servicing was actually positive as well. That happens occasionally but not typical.","When you look at the about $25 million that you had positive in valuation, but you also had prepayments that were coming through, so your actual cash flow increased the other adjustments of servicing value, how do you look at the net of those two things going forward in the impact to the mortgage banking fees in fourth quarter and then into next year?","Andy Cecere","Yes, Marty, I think when we end up, at least with respect to fourth quarter -- because it's a little hard to look beyond that -- but when we end up looking at looking at the fourth quarter relative to the MSR hedge, we would expect that to taper a little bit as well. That would be another reason why we would expect the mortgage banking revenue to decline somewhat during the quarter.","Marty Mosby","But the other changes would also taper down, so that big negative you had there would be less negative as you moved into the next quarter as well.","Andy Cecere","That's fair.","Operator","Your next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo","First, a follow-up from Investor Day, I wasn't sure about your appetite for bank acquisitions after that day. In other words, once you get the regulatory side resolved, are you willing to look a little bit more or not?","Richard Davis","Yes, sure. You can go back to, gosh, any of the 40 earnings calls I've had where we would remind you that we will more gladly double down in the 25 retail markets in states that we're in than to go into a new market where we would have lower pricing power and lower brand value. So think the Chicago deal a couple years ago, where we doubled down in Chicago. Think the New Mexico transaction; we moved in as number-three bank overnight. Those kind of opportunities will continue to be attractive to us.","The idea of moving into a new market that we don't currently have a position in would have to be remarkably attractive and it would have to be at a pretty high market position to get our attention. So the good news is, despite the fact that we haven't got the ability to do that right now, there's nothing out there that we wish we could have had and the timing is working out pretty well. But when that opportunity is back, you can well count on us looking in-market for sizable deals that are worth disrupting the momentum of the Company -- but in markets where we're already present.","Mike Mayo","Then a separate question. Your last comment at Investor Day, maybe I can call it the Richard Davis soliloquy.","Richard Davis","Well, I don't know. Now what? Me and the 10-year bond? What is it now?","Mike Mayo","Well, you go, look, banking has this remarkably noble opportunity to change the world; there's no other business I can think of. We don't feed people or fly people or give them medication; we get behind their possibilities. And it goes on a little bit more. And just the disconnect between that statement talking about the noble opportunity of banking and the tarnish the banking industry has now, due to some issues around cross-selling and--","Richard Davis","Sure.","Mike Mayo","I'm just looking for some additional perspective from you. What are you doing to ensure this doesn't happen at U.S. Bancorp? And, more generally, when you do make a mistake and you say there's a guarantee, what do you do to fulfill that guarantee?","Richard Davis","I just want to start out by saying, we've looked at this whole topic as industry and individual bank. Many years ago at a financial services roundtable, we made an effort to consider a nationwide brand reputation and rebuilding after the downturn and discovered very quickly that the American population wasn't ready for that. The bank industry sadly doesn't speak yet as one voice and even to date still doesn't. But we did agree that each of us could do a much better job of satisfying our own customers and building our own brand and eventually the totality of that would be the way to rebuild. I think, sadly, we're not where we'd like to be, but that's the way to do it.","So each bank needs to stand very strongly on its own and do what's right by its customers. And if one bank falls away from that, then it's just one bank; it's not an industry. So we'll figure out a way to tell that story better. In our Company, it's where you start that matters the most in terms of sales culture. And it's not even sales culture, it's culture. Just underline the word culture. Sales practice is part of that; the way you incentivize people is part of that; the way you handle your customers.","So answering your last question first, the guarantee is to always stand behind what you promise, overperform if you've made a mistake, atone and apologize, fix what's wrong and then figure out how that applies to the next possible action that could otherwise become a problem later. I've long talked about bankers going from baggage handlers to pilots in the same company. In fact, as of this morning baggage handlers now have to be more like pilots, if you follow the news out of the White House. But we believe that same thing is the case. I think as an industry we have to be much better at handling every individual transaction uniquely and honestly and genuinely. And when we make mistakes, get it right, fix it and apply it to the next things.","You know me, Mike. I've been with you as long as anybody on this call and we've never even use the word cross-sell. I don't even know what the cross-sell is at this Bank. Honest to God, I've never, ever looked at that number. I would guess it's between two and four because nobody wants -- any part of their lifecycle needs more than probably two or four services at one time from a bank. But we don't measure that. We don't set quotas. What we instead do is ask our employees to make sure people know what we have so that as their lifecycle change needs and if we're their trusted partner they'll ask us for it. What that means is people buy our products; we don't sell them.","As long as we have something they want and it's for services rendered and fees benefited, we'll be happy to provide that. I want to make sure it's clear, though, for this industry, selling is not bad. It's not bad anywhere, as long as you're selling to people's needs and you're making it clear what advantages you have to provide them at the time that they want them. So, yes, it's tough on the industry. But it still always go back to people love their banker, they like their bank, because they made those choices. They don't so much like the industry. We're sadly years away from getting that right. But if every bank and every banker does a better job, despite what happens on occasion in one location or another, we've got a fighting chance to bring this thing back.","And I'll close the soliloquy with the fact that this has all been accomplished under a very negative economic environment. One of the reasons banks were possible 10 years ago, notwithstanding the downturn, was when times are good banks are doing more positive things. People are healthier. The economy is moving more quickly. People want us and need us and we can say yes more often. When the world gets a little bit better, we can just say yes more often; we're more popular and we're more effective.","When times are tough, actually we move on to defense and we're there to protect people from things that could get them in harm's way. That's a less attractive position. People don't like to watch defensive games either, because it's low-scoring. At the end of the day, at the very end, it really does matter. So I do think it's a noble occupation. I'm very proud of what we do and very proud of the people that do it across this country. It's one of the most important things that we have in America and it's what makes us unique. And by the way, it's the only place where you can get leverage. $1 of deposits at a good bank is worth $7 in loans and that is an amazing way to grow an economy. ","So I'm going to still be in the camp of it will get there one day, but one bank at a time. We can control it on that basis and we're doing our best here to do that.","Operator","Your next question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin Barker","I just wanted to follow-up on some of the comments you made about mortgage banking. In particular, you're mentioning the increase in refi activity. I would assume that the refi activity would tend to be more retail originations versus correspondent. So you probably had a positive mix shift this quarter. Was that a dramatic impact on the number and the gain on sale margin? And going forward, do you expect that mix shift to change as well?","Andy Cecere","It was a little bit more retail. And just generally speaking, the gain on sale margins on refinancings are higher than purchases, so that was also a factor. As Terry mentioned, we would expect the refinancing component to go down in the fourth quarter as well as the overall volume. If you look at just the last few years, historically in a normal environment fourth quarter activity is down 10% to 15% because it's just fourth quarter; and new purchases particularly are down.","So I would expect that same trend. And we will update you at further conferences during the quarter to give you an update what we're seeing, because it's also very dependent upon rates, particularly at that level of the yield curve which is quite an impact to activity for the fourth quarter.","Kevin Barker","We're also seeing in the servicing market the market for MSRs softening and so the yields on those assets are going up. Are you seeing an opportunity to get better margins in the correspondent market and that support your overall gain on sale margin? And are you potentially participating in the purchase of MSRs?","Andy Cecere","We're not going to participate in the purchase of MSRs. We're in the correspondent market. It depends on the geography and the type of loan. I would say some of it is very competitive in terms of pricing and some of it a little less competitive. So it depends on the mix.","Operator","Your next question is from Brian Foran with Autonomous.","Brian Foran","Maybe on the auto business, I realize it's not a huge part of your loan book; between the loans and leases maybe 9% or so of the book. But it's been a source of growth. You outlined a couple years ago some ambitions for market share improvement which you seem to have achieved. I wonder if you could just talk about further appetite for growth both in loans and leases.","And then in terms of the credit quality, you had the comment in the release about lower residual gains. The appendix does show delinquencies rising, albeit from pristine levels. Is the performance you're seeing in line with what you had penciled out when you wanted to grow this book? Or is there a deterioration happening? Or how should we think about that?","Andy Cecere","Brian, this is Andy, I'll answer those questions. First of all, the volume continues to be strong. It's a function of our dealer partnerships and the technology investments that we've made in the business. It's a good mix of lease as well as purchase. I would expect us to continue to have partnerships expand and continue to see strong growth. I'd also mention that we do not do any subprime activity in this business and we in fact have very conservative credit standards both in terms of term as well as the credit quality underneath it.","So it is a high-quality portfolio and I'm very comfortable with the credit. One phenomenon that is occurring in the marketplace is residual values are coming down a bit. That's a function of dealer incentives going up which makes the comparison of new versus used favor the new. That means that the gain on sale is still positive, but might have been somewhere in the $1000 range, it's closer to $600 or $700. You'll see that phenomenon occur through our fee income category. Again I want to highlight it's still positive; it's just less positive.","Brian Foran","Maybe one follow-up, and just to get the spirit of the question right, it's not to pin down basis points and the efficiency ratio, but just to make sure it's the right base. For 2016, it sounds like efficiency will be a little higher; the ratio will be a little higher in 4Q. And then I'm assuming we're using the adjusted 2Q number. So as we think about slightly positive operating leverage with a couple rate hikes or maybe flat without, is the base 55%? Basically 55%?","Richard Davis","Okay, so you are trying to get the basis points. Look, this year it's going to look back, it's going to be in the mid-54%s. If we can deliver positive operating leverage -- and I said slightly -- then it stays in the mid-54%s. If we're unable to do that, it floats into 55%. Doesn't go above the mid-50%s and it doesn't go down to 51%. Until the world starts to give us a more robust both interest rate trajectory, mostly a steeper yield curve and\/or just a stronger economy -- pick any of the three and pick all of the three -- things start to take off.","So I'm going to say it as just much -- and expense is much of what you see this year, it's much of what you'll see next year. It's not going to move a lot one way or the other for better or for worse. But I will tell you it's the revenue that we're going to try to hope we can pull down even further into in 2017 and keep growing this thing like we do every year. We had record EPS this year. It's not just because we had a decent buyback but because we have good underlying loan quality and good underwriting and really decent revenue. So we're going to keep delivering that, Brian. And I would just expect it to be fairly consistent with what you see this year.","Operator","Your next question is from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.","Jason Harbes","It's actually Jason Harbes on Matt's team. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but maybe I'll just ask a question on the card business. You've seen really nice momentum there this year. It looks like a lot of that is on the back of a Fidelity portfolio acquisition late last year.","One thing that caught my eye was the net charge-off ratio was unusually low both sequentially and year-over-year. Is that primarily a function of the higher quality of that Fidelity book? Because I'm looking at the reported level compared to your normalized through-the-cycle target of 4.65% and it's quite a bit below. So just any comments around how your credit card business is going would be much appreciated.","Andy Cecere","This is Andy again. Yes, that is the key difference; the Fidelity portfolio is slightly higher quality. Our card portfolio is very high quality, but the downturn that you see in that charge-off level of delinquencies is a function of the higher-quality Fidelity portfolio.","Jason Harbes","Maybe just a bigger-picture question on the expense outlook for next year, this year it looks like you're going to come in a bit above the 3% to 5% target. A lot of that seems like it's related to some of the remediation activities that you are undertaking. But as we think about 2017, would it be realistic to think you might actually come in more towards the low end, as those costs or issues are resolved?","Terry Dolan","Yes, Jason, one of the things that we've talked about when you think about the compliance programs -- and it ties into some of the things that Richard talked about with respect to AML and BSA -- we'll continue to work on that probably through next year. Last quarter we said that the compliance costs were peaking in the second quarter, but we also said that we really don't see them declining significantly, at least not through 2017.","In other words, I would think about it more as it's kind of plateauing and it's going to stay at that level at least for some period of time until we get through some of these compliance issues. So if you're thinking about the 2017 time frame, that's the way that I would think about it.","Operator","Your final question is from Nancy Bush with NAB Research.","Nancy Bush","Good morning, Richard. How are you?","Richard Davis","I'm good. I was wondering where you were.","Nancy Bush","Still here in Georgia.","Richard Davis","Well, you were on the Morgan Stanley call; I know you love them more.","Nancy Bush","Yes. Yes, you could have brought up the -- you opened the door with mentioning election and Brexit and some other things. But I'm just more curious about your view of the regulatory scene right now. It seems everybody is focusing on Tarullo's latest speech or what a Fed governor is saying and we're losing sight of the forest for the trees. So can you just give me your impression of the overall regulatory scene? And do you expect it to change markedly one way or the other depending on the outcome of the election?","Richard Davis","First of all, I think -- and I said this at our Investor Day. I think if we're a nine-inning game, we're probably in the eighth inning. We know most of the conditions. We know the condition on the field. We know the umpires. We know the fan attitude. We know the weather. We know the ball speed. There's not a lot here new. And there will be some adjustments to the election, but as you know, most of these positions are not tied directly to the election or directly to the President's term. They have different term timetables; and think the FDIC and the OCC to name two.","So I think the philosophies and the general sense of what regulation looks like for banks is pretty well set. I think we understand most of those rules and what we're dealing with now is nuances, why certain speeches make so much attention, because we're trying to read tea leaves and figure out if they changed anything systemic. I don't think there's anything major to change. I also think a new President which is undoubtedly going to happen, has a slight variation one way or the other. I won't talk about which one I think does which, but one gets a little more uncertain and causes us to stand back a little bit and wait to see how things settle. ","The other one is a lot more of the same and probably, whether we like it or not, is something we can manage because it's the devil we know. Either way, I don't see any circumstances where bank regulation gets easier or lightens. I don't see a significant place where it gets any tougher or gets a lot stronger. I do think there's going to be a need for us to particularly respond to this current issue on culture and doing the right thing and that makes sense to me and that's a place that we'll welcome that oversight.","In fact, maybe to the earlier question, if banks are proven for the most part to be doing really the right things the right way, that might be a very positive catalyst for the American people. Because they now know that we're stronger; they know we're safer. They don't know that we intend to be good with that. And if we can prove that over the course of the next couple years, especially as the economy might get better at the same time, I think we're in a pretty good place. But for this bank, there's not a lot -- we don't spend a lot of energy trying to figure out what's going to happen next. We have relationship with regulators both local and national that we know and trust. And for us it's part of doing business and I think it's a normal course of running the bank. We don't fret about it and we don't try to predict anything.","Nancy Bush","Well, on this issue of culture, how do you see that coming to the fore? Is that going to become a special -- does that get built into the DFAST? How do you see that happening?","Richard Davis","Yes, that's a good question. That's too early to know. I do know and I believe it's known, that the OCC is conducting a horizontal review, first and foremost starting immediately on unauthorized new accounts. They are doing that horizontally. I don't know how far it's going but it's the first of -- look at more things like incentive practices and then will be, I think, eventually culture. We're thinking of it as culture and we always have from the very beginning. But I think, Nancy, that will find its way probably through more likely the OCC under the doctrine that they have as they oversee the banks. And then the Fed for the Fed banks will find their own way to approach it.","I don't necessarily see it going into a CCAR stress test environment at this early stage. I see it being more of a pattern and practice for the CAMEL ratings and the overall valuation of management and board oversight. So for me I think it's just another nuance and we keep getting different things. It's a spotlight on a stage, right? Everything is on the stage, but you can only see the stuff the spotlight is on. It's just going to move across and now find something in the form of culture.","I think we're all going to need to put better words around what we do. I think we're going to have to prove what we do. And I think we're going to have to show sustainability to good practices and that does require us to do a lot more record-keeping, a lot more auditing, a lot more quality assurance. I would say it's actually a pretty good thing, because most banks do it very, very well.","And I think we're going to find out that that's an area of strength that we can showcase, that banks haven't been able to really put their finger on until now. Unfortunately, it takes a blemish to bring out the issues, but I think you'll be -- the American people will be quite pleased with what they find.","Nancy Bush","Okay. One other regulatory issue, the fact that the EU seems to be backing away from Basel, do you think that will change anything? Does that make any difference? Do we not go to Basel IV? What do you think the impact of that is?","Richard Davis","I don't predict that one as well, because I do think this one does matter a lot in who's in a position. I think Dan Tarullo's been our best guiding voice on this particular topic, both on what volatile means to the United States banks and what it means in relationship to the global circumstances. As long as he's in position I don't think it goes away and I think he continues to argue the position that America's banks need to be at the highest, best, strongest, position first and foremost -- but in an environment where all the banks have to account for the same general level of oversight.","If Dan were to change positions, I think that will have a meaningful impact on whether or not the position of the domestic banks in relation to the international banks remains the same or not. But I think there's a general sense across the world that everyone wants all the banks to be stronger. They're looking for a governing doctrine. Basel seems to be the one that allows everybody to think most banks across the world have generally the same minimum oversight; and we're all getting there at different speeds.","So I think it's probably still the best proxy and I don't think it changes greatly. I think the verbiage of a speech or a general sentiment that things aren't going to be adopted or things are going to be changed is just that, it's a small nuance. I think we're all going to stay within the confines of a general Basel oversight created out of the institutions across the country that have a voice and then America being probably the loudest.","Operator","I will now turn the call back over for closing remarks.","Jen Thompson","Thank you for listening to this review of our third quarter results.

Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page two of today\u2019s presentation in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Richard.","Richard Davis","Thank you, Sean, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our call. I will begin our review of U.S. Bank\u2019s results with a summary of the quarter\u2019s highlights on page three of the presentation.","U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $1.5 billion for the third quarter of 2015, a record $0.81 per diluted common share, a 3.8% increase year-over-year.","I was particularly pleased this quarter by the continued momentum in our payments business, specifically our retail card and merchant processing services, the stabilization of our net interest margin and a returnable linked quarter loan growth to our typical range of 1% to 1.5%. During the quarter, we returned our student loan portfolio from held-for-sale to held-for-investment. Subsequent to recognizing a market adjustment on the portfolio, related to disruption in student loan market. Excluding these student loan balances, total average loans grew 1.3% on a linked quarter basis.","In addition, we continued to experience strong growth in total average deposits, which included consumer net new account growth of 3.1%. Credit quality continues to remain strong. Total net charge-offs and total non-performing assets both declined on a year-over-year basis and on a linked quarter basis.","And finally, our capital position remains solid. We continue to generate significant capital this quarter and were able to return 80% of our earnings to shareholders in the third quarter, through a combination of our dividend and repurchase of 16 million shares of common stock.","Slide four provides you with a five-quarter history of our performance metrics, and they remain among the best in the industry. Return on average assets in the third quarter was 1.44%, and return on average common equity was 14.1%.","Moving over to the graph on the right, you can see that this quarter\u2019s net interest margin of 3.04% was essentially flat with the previous quarter margin of 3.03% as expected. This reversed a declining trend in linked quarter margin that has occurred over the past several quarters and which is principally driven by a shift in the mix of our loan portfolio.","Our efficiency ratio for the third quarter was 53.9%. We expect this ratio to remain in the low 50s going forward as we continue to manage expenses in a challenging economic environment. During the third quarter, we expanded our prudent FTE management focus and introduced a renewed emphasis on other discretionary spending. We anticipate our efforts related to these initiatives will begin to reflect positive momentum as we move through quarter four and into 2016.","While we anticipate our non-interest expense will be higher on a year-over-year basis in quarter four, we expect the increase will be lower than the year-over-year increase reported in the last several quarters as a result of our actions we\u2019re taking to reduce discretionary spending using technology to reduce certain traditional expenses and focusing our spending on more productive activities.","This is being accomplished through FTE actions as well as programs that will reduce travel cost by effectively using video and teleconferencing, increasing our use of airfare and hotel discounts and eliminating most discretionary travel. We\u2019re also expanding the use of electronic communications internally and with our customers to reduce spending in printing and postage. Additionally, we began to evaluate professional service and contract labor arrangement and we expect to see improved efficiencies as resources are more appropriately allocated.","We\u2019ll continue to leverage this efficiency effort to drive further opportunities for more prudent and efficient spending as we move through 2016. While prudent expense management remains a priority for our Company, we also continue to focus on revenue growth, which includes investing in businesses and products that will yield a high level of return. This philosophy is and has been a strength on how we manage our Company and this focus will continue going forward.","Moving onto slide five, I want to highlight some notable impacts to our earnings. The third quarter of 2015 included several previously disclosed unrelated items that combine relatively neutral to earnings. Specifically the Company recognized a gain from the sale of Visa Class B common stock of approximately $135 million. This was partially offset by a $58 million market valuation adjustment to write down the value of our student loan portfolio that was previously held for sale. The quarter also included approximately $60 million of elevated expenses due to the mortgage related compliance and the company-wide talent upgrade.","Turning to slide six, the Company reported total net revenue in the third quarter of $5.1 billion, a 1.6% increase from the prior year excluding the impact of this quarter\u2019s recent sale and the student loan market adjustments. The revenue momentum we are seeing is primarily due to our growing balance sheet and growth in a number of our fee related businesses, including payments.","Kathy will now give a few more details about our third quarter results.","Kathy Rogers","Thanks Richard. Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on slide seven. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $9 billion or 3.8% year-over-year and 1.3% linked quarter excluding student loan.","Again this quarter, the increase in average loans outstanding on a year-over-year basis was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 9.5%. Total average revolving commercial and commercial real estate commitment continued to grow at a fast pace, increasing year-over-year by 8.9%; line utilization remained similar to the previous quarter. On a linked quarter basis, consumer loans have begun to grow at a pace stronger than wholesale loans driven by growth in our residential mortgage portfolio and continued strength in our home equity and auto lending businesses. This mix of loan growth is a key factor in the stabilization of our net interest margin.","Residential mortgages were relatively flat year-over-year and increased 1.4% on a linked quarter basis, reversing a declining trend recognized over the previous quarter. Averaged credit card loans increased 1.1% year-over-year and were up 1.9% on a linked quarter basis. Total other retail loans grew 5.6% year-over-year and 1.9% over the prior quarter excluding the student loans. The increase was mainly driven by steady growth in auto loans and continued positive momentum in home equity loans which grew 0.8% linked quarter. We would expect loan growth to continue in a 1% to 1.5% range in quarter four.","Total average deposits increased almost $19 billion to 6.9% over the same quarter of last year and 1.4% over the previous quarter. Growth to non-interest bearing and low-cost interest checking, money market and saving deposits was particularly strong on a year-over-year basis, offsetting the run-off of maturing large dollar time deposit.","Turning to slide eight and credit quality, total net charge-offs declined 1.4% on a linked quarter basis and 13.1% on a year-over-year basis. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 46 basis points in the third quarter. Non-performing assets decreased by 0.6% on a linked quarter basis and 18.5% from the third quarter of 2014.","During the third quarter, we released $10 million of reserves compared to $25 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $15 million in the second quarter of 2015. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect total non-performing assets to remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the level of net charge-offs to increase modestly in the fourth quarter of 2015, principally due to the expectation of a lower level of recoveries.","Slide nine gives a view of our third quarter 2015 results versus comparable time period. As mentioned, our diluted EPS of $0.81 was 3.8% higher than the third quarter of 2014 and 1.3% higher than the prior quarter. The $18 million or 1.2% increase in net income year-over-year was principally due to higher net interest income and non-interest income offset by higher non-interest expense. On a linked quarter basis, net income was higher by $6 million or 0.4%, mainly due to increases in net interest income and non-interest income, partially offset by higher non-interest expense.","Turning to slide 10, net interest income increased year-over-year by $73 million or 2.7%. The increase was a result of growth in average earning assets of 6.6% partially offset by a lower net interest margin. The net interest margin of 3.04% was 12 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2014. The decline was principally due to a change in loan portfolio mix as well as growth in the investment portfolio at lower average rate and lower reinvestment rates on investment securities.","Net interest income increased $51 million on a linked quarter basis, primarily due to higher average total loans and an additional day in the quarter. The net interest margin of 3.04% was 1 basis-point higher than the second quarter. The increase in net interest margin was principally due to growth in earning assets including a shift in loan mix weighted more to consumer loans and continued deposit growth partially offset by an increase in lower rate investment securities along with lower reinvestment portfolio rates. We currently expect that the net interest margin will be relatively stable in the fourth quarter.","Slide 11 highlights non-interest income which increased $84 million or 3.7% year-over-year. The year-over-year increase in non-interest income was primarily due to the third quarter 2015 Visa gain of approximately $135 million partially offset by the $58 million student loan market value adjustment. The remaining increase in non-interest income was principally due to higher commercial products revenue, trust and investment management fees, credit and debit card revenues, and merchant processing services. Partially offsetting these favorable variances was $36 million decrease in mortgage banking revenue primarily due to an unfavorable change in evaluation of mortgage servicing rights, net of hedging activity.","Momentum in our payments business was reflected in our third quarter results. Credit and debit card fees grew 7.2% on a year-over-year basis, principally driven by higher volume compared to 2.7% growth year-over-year in the second quarter. We would expect that credit card fees in quarter four will continue to grow in line with volume.","Merchant processing revenue increased 3.4% year-over-year, 8.5% excluding the impact of foreign currency rate changes. This increase compares to year-over-year growth of 7.6% in quarter two. The growth was driven by higher transaction volume, account growth and equipment sales to merchants related to new chip card technology requirement. We would expect that quarter four year-over-year growth in merchant fees will be modestly lower than the growth recognized in quarter three as equipment sales related to the new chip card technology requirements will begin to slow.","On a linked quarter basis, non-interest income was higher by $54 million or 2.4% principally due to higher other income in commercial product revenue as well as seasonally higher corporate payment products revenue and deposit service charges partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue. We currently expect mortgage fees to be down 5% to 15% on a linked quarter basis in quarter four due to typical seasonality. It is very early in the quarter and we\u2019ll update guidance as the quarter progresses. The other income increase was due to higher equity gains including the Visa gain offset by student loan, market adjustment and lower trading gain.","Moving to slide 12, non-interest expense increased year-over-year by $161 million or 6.2%. The increase was mainly due to higher compensation expense, reflecting the impact of merit increases and higher staffing for risk and compliance activity, higher employee benefits expense mainly due to higher pension costs and higher marketing and business development expense.","On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense increased by $93 million or 3.5%. As expected linked quarter expense increased due to the seasonal lift in tax credit amortization included in other expense, and an increase in expense related to the quarter two partner reimbursements that did not repeat in quarter three which are principally reflected in printing and supplies expense. The remaining increase was primarily due to increases in other expense related to mortgage servicing and talent upgrade costs and compensation expense principally reflecting the impact of an additional day in the quarter and increases in variable compensation.","As we look to quarter four, we do expect an increase in linked non-interest expense as seasonally higher tax credit amortization will be partially offset by a reduction in expense related to the elevated mortgage servicing and talent upgrade costs that were included in quarter three expense. The normal seasonal increase in tax credit amortization expense is expected to be in a range of $65 million to $75 million, slightly higher than trends observed in the same period of last year.","Turning to slide 13, as Richard mentioned, our capital position remains strong. We returned 80% of our earnings to shareholders; dividends accounted for 32% while stock repurchases accounted for the remaining 48%. Our common equity tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as is fully implemented at September 30th was 9.2%. At 9.2%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our intangible book value per share rose to $17.20 at September 30th, representing the 9.8% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 2.4% increase over the prior quarter.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Richard.","Richard Davis","Thank you, Kathy. I\u2019m very proud of our third quarter results. We reported a record EPS, maintained our industry leading performance measures and reported a 19% return on tangible common equity in the quarter. We\u2019re operating from a position of strength as we grow revenue, as we manage expenses, as we seek to exceed customer expectations, and as we create value for our shareholders in the demanding marketplace.","As we head into the final quarter of the year, we remain focused on delivering consistent, predictable and repeatable financial results for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our communities and our shareholders.","That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Kathy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.","Jon Arfstrom","Richard, just a question for you; just take your temperature on loan growth and how are you feeling about the outlook. You\u2019re right down the middle this quarter, just wonder there is anything out there that makes you any more or less optimistic as you look to Q4 and to 2016 in terms of loan grow?","Richard Davis","I would say just more of the same which is not pessimistic but it\u2019s not uber optimistic either. I mean we\u2019re seeing a nice transition to consumers getting more steady in their spending patterns. I think we\u2019ll see a nice seasonal lift in credit cards in the fourth quarter. Auto loans as you know remain strong. Our Bank has been benefited by a strong home equity growth of portfolio and not having some other run-offs that other portfolios have had. So, you will continue to see I think all cylinders on consumer growth. And that will be a nice challenge to probably an equal growth we\u2019ll continue to see in C&I and CRE as well as small business.","So, what you saw this quarter is probably the optimal work here for a while which is a nice 1% to 1.5% linked quarter probably even on both commercial and wholesale which gives us a nice blend for the margin. I would say the competitiveness on the rates are pretty steady and we\u2019re not seeing an undue amount of pressure except in the middle market C&I space, everything else seems to be managing itself pretty well. The one area that we\u2019re not growing right now is CRE. I certainly mentioned this time we talked that it\u2019s an area that we think has some undue risk in it; it\u2019s a pretty overheated market in not just certain locations but tenures and the terms and the recourse non-recourse decisions that some banks are making and we\u2019re not going to participate in that. So don\u2019t be disappointed if you don\u2019t see commercial real estate grow a great deal. We\u2019ll probably hold our own and keep our market share but that\u2019s an area we\u2019re going to keep particularly close eye on.","And then finally areas of real opportunity, the small business category still looks good especially under the $350,000 level. Real small businesses feeling that they\u2019ve got some real value now or some real cash flow either from their own personal circumstances or from their own business. And we\u2019re starting to see a higher percentage of take up on that, both SPA and traditional small business. And I think our market share continues to reflect the growth in the last couple of quarter. So, a lot more of the same, the catalyst I think is I\u2019ve said before will be the real movement in interest rates. The first mover impact which I think will trigger quite an impact on these C&I and the larger company space for the one and not miss the opportunity to get lock in rates before they start moving up at no matter what speed but until then it\u2019s just kind of more what you\u2019re seeing. We\u2019ll get it out in the marketplace with prime only quality loans at a pricing advantage that I think we continue to be able to benefit from.","Jon Arfstrom","And then just a follow-up on what you just said, this is the first time we\u2019ve seen loan yields relatively flat and earning assets yields relatively flat. How are you feeling about just pricing in the competitive environment?","Richard Davis","Andy, why don\u2019t you give him that?","Andy Cecere","I think as Richard mentioned, in the large corporate space, I would say pricing is relatively stable; middle market can be aggressive because fewer competitors can make a difference there. And the other area on the retail side of the equation is auto lending, continues to be fairly competitive in terms of pricing. Other than those categories relatively stable.","Operator","Thanks. We have John McDonald with Bernstein.","John McDonald","Just wondering on the expense side, Richard, is there any way to size the potential opportunity from the increased focus on the non-FTE expense?","Richard Davis","Yes. You got the question too. Listen, first of all, we\u2019re going to be very careful on not heading where we shouldn\u2019t. And I am not -- we\u2019re still a long-term company, so we\u2019re not going to make big mistakes here and over manage this. But I will tell you that this discretionary addition to our otherwise prudent FTE impacts is going to start showing itself for the first time in quarter four and we\u2019re going to get that a range of $10 million to $15 million benefit that we wouldn\u2019t have had if we\u2019ve not started this effort. 2016, we\u2019re in the middle of the planning process; so it will obviously be more than that but it\u2019s going to be thoughtful.","And I think you all know that we\u2019re giving you our efforts to get back to positive operating leverage on an annual basis. Then as you look into plan next year, that\u2019s our goal is to make it a positive operating leverage. But at the same token, I don\u2019t want to starve the future and find out that we over manage something and got this company back to really where it was 10 years ago where we were just investing. So, we\u2019re going to be thoughtful about it but it\u2019s got real impact but not huge in quarter four. And then we\u2019ll have a better idea to give you since later this quarter as we look to 2016 and see what kind of impacts the cumulative facts of all that can be. But I assure you, we\u2019re going to continue invest in places we need to and where the ROI is good. I don\u2019t see an expense; I\u2019ve seen investment and we\u2019ll continue to be thoughtful on that distinction.","John McDonald","So, don\u2019t want to box you into a corner to really on next year, but just want to kind of get sense of your conviction level on the ability to deliver the positive operating leverage without rates. Back in September at the conference you kind of said, hey, now I don\u2019t care. Is it something you feel like pretty good about being able to deliver or really going to depend a lot on the environment still?","Richard Davis","What I said was I care less, not I don\u2019t care, I do care. The fact is that we\u2019re going to put into our plan an expectation for very, very nominal number and size of rate increases which much less we\u2019ve had in the years past, so nominal that it\u2019s very small that to the extent that that occurs and in case nothing happens, we will struggle to get positive operating leverage. To the extent that anything happens, we\u2019re going to build a plan to give it very close to that, so that we can approximate revenue growth and expense growth to be somewhere near the same where revenue slightly outpaces it. And there is a reasonable amount of increases or sooner than later, then we\u2019ll have much bigger opportunity to provide much more positive operating leverage. But we\u2019re building it to be right at the line so that we can deliver back to what we committed, start growing the Bank that way again and then any benefits we get will be a bonus. But do we need one or two, John, over the next 15 months but we don\u2019t need much more than that; we don\u2019t need them all right now and they don\u2019t need to be big.","John McDonald","And then just on the idea of if rates stay low, revenue environment stays challenging, does the idea of bank acquisitions get more attractive for you Richard? And can you just elaborate what you said about kind of statute of limitations and kind of legal risks as a barrier to you are doing deals?","Richard Davis","Good memory. I told you that I think the statute in our head kind of ends in \u201817. So I don\u2019t think \u201816 is going to be a year where you\u2019ll see us jumping into big bank deals or big branch deals. But we do love the non-capital, the business of fees and trust. And you saw recent acquisition we made of the Auto Club card portfolio, there are more where that came from John and those are very attractive deals; they are bolt-on; they\u2019re low capital. But for the provision, you need to put in front of them. And the small conversion task is a good way to grow the balance sheet and we\u2019ll continue to see opportunities there. So, I think \u201816 looks like the tail end of the last four, five years and then \u201817 probably becomes the time we\u2019ll start looking at more traditional bank deals.","And frankly, we don\u2019t really feel we need them right now. Our deposit growth is steady; our customer growth patterns are steady; our relationships are getting deeper and we\u2019ve always said wanted double down where we are; more than grow where we aren\u2019t. And so far that\u2019s working for us. And I don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re starved at all by not being able to do that.","John McDonald","Are there other things that you need to get to that in terms of before you can do deals in terms of regulatory check list and things like that?","Richard Davis","I don\u2019t think we -- we don\u2019t think there is an environment where that\u2019s going to necessarily impair our interest. I think we have to watch for the trailing risk that I mentioned before especially inheriting it from that you didn\u2019t you create yourself and you also want to spend time making sure that everything you have in your houses in good order, but I don\u2019t see anything new on the horizon or any new information that would change our appetite.","Operator","We have Paul Miller with FBR.","Paul Miller","Where are you at on -- I know on acquisitions and what do you see out there; are things loosening up a little bit or some of the improvement -- and what type of size you think you can go after at this point?","Richard Davis","Paul, I don\u2019t know that they are any more attractive than they have been in the last few years. I think there are certain boards sitting around boardrooms saying at smaller sizes are we going to make it at this level, can we afford with our scale to be profitable; that might change a little bit. But we\u2019re not seeing an intensely different environment that we\u2019ve seen in the last eight quarters, not more players, not higher quality players, not more desperate players. And our attraction, our interest is low. So maybe that\u2019s because we\u2019re saying we\u2019re not interested, we\u2019re not getting a lot of bites. But we\u2019re not denying anything that we think is too good to pass. And I actually don\u2019t think -- I am not attracted to other banks right now. I just for all the reasons you mentioned -- I mentioned to you before, this year positioning in this moment in time. It\u2019s enough to carry your entire balance sheet across the goal line when interest rates are low and deposits don\u2019t have value, but they are going to be valuable one day again and you\u2019re going to be glad you have all of those deposit gather in place. We have 3,186 right now; that\u2019s probably quite enough for us. I am just not -- we\u2019re not seeing an attraction on our part and no one is coming out for us with a different or better story.","Paul Miller","Are you seeing any communities or some of the small areas struggling with the low oil prices especially in some of this -- some areas you\u2019re in with the -- couldn\u2019t get it out, the frac, I couldn\u2019t get it out?","Richard Davis","There are markets that we have business like Lewiston and Williston and those parts of the Dakotas, which is like the old gold rush; things start slowing down, the town moves downstream. We don\u2019t do much business there anyway; we didn\u2019t set up any locations; we didn\u2019t create infrastructure because we didn\u2019t think it was sustainable. And for the most part becoming mostly a Midwest and West Coast company, we\u2019re outside of the Texas Panhandle and down of the Gulf Coast. And so that\u2019s for a few customers that might have some tension tertiary impacts to energy, we really don\u2019t have anything at our gun sites and none of our communities are struggling in that category either based on the consumer or the small business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Just following up on the fee side, just want to ask you guys to remind us, you\u2019re getting towards better comps on a year-over-year basis in some of these fee areas. Can you kind of walk us through in addition to mortgage in the fourth quarter to be mindful of what are the plus and minus seasonalities and where are you seeing kind of better comps versus still some challenges to face on the fee side?","Andy Cecere","Hi Ken, this is Andy. In the fourth quarter, I would expect to see continued strength in our merchant processing a little lower on a linked quarter basis because as Kathy mentioned, we have very strong equipment sales in the third quarter that will continue at a lower level in the fourth quarter. But the year-over-year comps will continue to be very favorable. Card is always positive in the fourth quarter. Corporate Payments is down a little bit because the third quarter is the big quarter for that one. Trust is going to be dependent a little bit upon the markets, so there is the market impact to that, the S&P market impacts fees overall. And then mortgage fees I would expect to be modestly down in the fourth quarter. Typical seasonality in the fourth quarter is down 5% to 15%.","Ken Usdin","So, when I think about all of that, is it kind of just naturally just going to be a little bit tougher for fee growth just given those couple of normal fourth quarter seasonalities plus mortgage?","Andy Cecere","I think if you take out the couple of unusual items that we had this quarter, the Visa gain and the student loan impact, I would expect moderate growth on a linked quarter basis.","Ken Usdin","And then secondly in terms of the ability to kind of hold the margin flattish from here, are we now done with kind of investment portfolio build? I know a lot of it will still be dependent on deposit growth which continues to be pretty good, but what are you doing as far as the rate environment and investment portfolio builds and mix?","Kathy Rogers","This is Kathy. So, as you know from an investment portfolio perspective, we are at our LCR coverage ratio. So, any activity that you\u2019ll see in our investment portfolio along with sales will be in line with balance sheet. So I don\u2019t expect a significant amount there. We will continue to see some impact from the reinvestment rate through; however as some of those securities pay down and we reinvest, that will come on at a bit lower spread than what we had before. Although that mitigated a bit for us in third quarter, we\u2019ll take our eyes on fourth quarter in the rate environment. So I think really what causes us to think about stable margin as we go into fourth quarter, this continued mix of our loan portfolio. So, as the consumer loans are -- and we expect them to continue to be a bigger piece of the growth on a linked quarterly basis, that will guide us to stable margins as we look into quarter four.","Operator","The next question is from Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache","Richard, I had a high level strategic question for you on Elavon. Clearly, it\u2019s a very high return generating business that contributes nicely to your profitability, but there are number of publicly traded merchant acquirers out there trading in around 25 times or so on forward earnings and that\u2019s arguably not a valuation that Elavon is getting inside of USB. And we\u2019ve gotten some questions from investors who\u2019ve been wondering whether there is an opportunity there for you guys to unlock some value by spinning it off, particularly with what we\u2019ve seen from some other banks who have spun out their acquiring businesses and they\u2019re actually doing quite well today and we\u2019ve got some other IPOs happening now. And just kind of with all of that as a backdrop, can you speak to how you think about that?","Richard Davis","First of all Bill, this has actually come up before; I think it\u2019s maybe five or six years ago in the earlier stages of my CEO time. And as it turns out, we just have to go back around and describe not only the merits of having that kind of business in a bank but connected to the bank. So first of all, we\u2019re an acquirer but we\u2019re also an issuer and with that combination comes a remarkable benefit that an acquirer alone doesn\u2019t have. And so we can do the testing, we can do the modeling; we\u2019ve talked about close loops before. Everything we want to pilot or understand about consumer and merchant behavior is we can test both sides of that and there is an amazing amount of value to that that I would strongly want to connect to.","The second piece is we do a lot of that business for our own customers. So instead of having to outsource an acquiring position to our retailers or our small merchant, we actually provide that service to them directly. I think still some banks provide insurance and they do it directly to their customers; we do the merchant acquiring. And maybe as importantly, we do this for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of smaller banks across the nation. And the smaller bank, if I were a smaller bank and I used to work at one, I would trust the capabilities and the -- I\u2019ll call the regulatory understanding of the environment another bank more than the non-bank.","So we get a lot of benefits by being a bank doing business for other banks with white label and private label that we call it there merchant servicing. But with it comes an amazing flow of new business and highly retained customers by being a bank to other banks. So all that is probably not unlocked as you said but it\u2019s certainly a part and parcel of the why we think this business is great, why we want to keep growing it. It has international feeling too, so I\u2019ve got a nice natural hedge now with all the business we do in Europe and in Central and South America. There is no reason that can\u2019t continue to grow as long as the economic social impacts are understood. And so the volatility of the foreign exchange, we have no other risk because it\u2019s a 24-hour settlement.","So, it\u2019s a great business. We love it. The cost of entry for other banks is quite prohibitive. So, I want to stick with it; stay with it; grow with it. But if I were to dis-couple from the bank, it would become more germane to a standalone merchant acquirer that has none of the benefits I just described.","Bill Carcache","If I may separately, can you share any thoughts on where the non-operating deposits at some of the larger banks have been deemphasizing or going? And are you guys actively doing anything to either keep those away or perhaps could you potentially see value in them?","Andy Cecere","Our deposit base is principally operating. We have been very good about managing the core there. We don\u2019t have some of those non-operating more fluctuating higher volatility deposits. So that has not been an issue for us, so we have not been turning any away. We\u2019ve been working with our customers. And again for the most part ours are operating in core.","Bill Carcache","And is the deposit growth that you guys have been seeing just kind of a result or are you guys actively kind of managing that growth? It kind of stands out because your deposit growth still is exceeding your loan growth and we\u2019re actually seeing that at the system level that that\u2019s no longer the case; loan growth has now started to exceed deposit growth. I am just wondering if that was something that you guys were actively trying to drive.","Kathy Rogers","No, we\u2019re really -- we\u2019re not actively managing any kind of deposit growth or as Andy said, we\u2019re not looking at getting out of any deposits either on our books. So really what you see in our deposit growth is what -- just the core growth that we\u2019re seeing from our consumer -- our customer base. And I will say that really is across all the categories in our wholesale and our consumer. And keep in mind that we do have that strong base of deposits within our corporate trust area. So, we do see deposit growth really across the Company and it\u2019s really just a reflection of what our customers are doing.","Richard Davis","We\u2019re all going to have to get ready for this moment when deposits start to flow out of banks and we should celebrate it. You\u2019re all going to want to measure the beta and who loses the most and what\u2019s the retention factor, we\u2019ll all be prepared for that. But we really do want to see customers use their deposits; they\u2019re back up to a savings level now that hasn\u2019t been seen in 12 years. That\u2019s great for America but now we want them to use that. And all the field pricing for the most part benefits seem to have gone into savings in some form of either paying down debt or saving it in the bank, which great, which is great, but we all do want to see that start to move because as we\u2019ve said before, the first canary in the mind is deposits go down; secondly lines of credit that are already extended but not used get used and then eventually a loans of loan start to happen. That\u2019s how the cycle reverses itself. We\u2019re still not there and honestly I will be the first to cheer when deposits start to flow out because consumerism starts and because the economy is really back up and running.","Bill Carcache","Do you see Richard, a scenario where that competition for deposits could potentially intensify perhaps even before the Fed raises rates or is it kind of a function of the Fed having to raise rates first?","Richard Davis","Yes, it\u2019s going to be definitely not before, not even at that moment; it will be later when either somebody has decided, they miss guided themselves in this quieter period and got rid of their deposit gathering options and need to go out and price up for it or there will be a bank or two to that wants to get clever and creative and try to get the market movement and do these laddering programs and these guarantees and things that we never did before and wouldn\u2019t recommend in the future. But those kinds of behaviors I think you\u2019ll see but they won\u2019t happen now and they won\u2019t happen even at the point of great increase. They will happen when people start to realize deposit start to matter again and they\u2019ll have to decide to get hungry for an avenue they might have closed off.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.","John Pancari","On the margin, got your guidance for fourth quarter for stable; on 2016, just want to see if you can give us a little bit of color there. Do you expect that the margins should hold relatively stable through \u201816 as well or do you think pricing competition can still have a bit of effect on that?","Kathy Rogers","John, we\u2019re guiding into the fourth quarter and I would be hesitant to guide out past that. But what I would say is if we continue -- the loan mix of our portfolio growth with consumer growing a little bit higher at higher spreads and we see on the wholesale, I think that coupled with just our reinvestment rate impact on securities is kind of starting to narrow a bit. There is similar or those things continue as we move into 2016, I would think that we would have similar type expectations. But at this point we\u2019re looking quarter-to-quarter and as we said probably stable into quarter four.","John Pancari","And then separately, just wanted to get your updated thoughts for -- or the updated strategy around mortgage banking basically through the standpoint of how much you plan to still push production there and then your retention strategy versus originate to sell.","Andy Cecere","So, if it\u2019s a qualifying mortgage Freddie or Fannie, we will sell that. It is a better financial decision from our perspective to originate and sell those mortgages. If it is a jumble or non sellable mortgage, we\u2019ll put down on the balance sheet; we\u2019ve been a little bit more aggressive with that particularly with our own customers have talked about that. So, that would be our expectation. We\u2019ve gone from about 21st in terms of size to fifth or sixth and I would expect us to continue to be in that range. Our particular emphasis is to put more branch distribution as a focus in terms of our core growth. And that is something that we continue to drive and are successful and increasing. So, I expect to see us grow aftermarket grabs little bit above the market particularly focused on branch and if it\u2019s sellable, we will sell it.","John Pancari","Last question is just around the reserve, edged a little bit lower this quarter by a few bps. Do you think all things equal that should still see that reserve to loan ration edge lower over the next couple of quarters as well?","Richard Davis","Bill, do you want to take that?","Bill Parker","Sure, I can take that. So, we\u2019re getting to the point where our reserve release has been de minimis really and we have to weigh the balance of continued improving loan quality versus loan growth. So, we\u2019re looking at a point now where we -- we\u2019re probably flattened out to seeing some increases in the wholesale area and the one area where there is still some potential for credit opportunity, reserve opportunities in residential mortgage. But we\u2019re just about at that point where those -- that mix is flattening out and I expect that will eventually have to provide for loan growth.","Operator","The next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","Vivek Juneja","Hi, couple of questions for you folks. Firstly, the equipment sales in merchant processing that you were talking about, how much of that is due to the new EMV adoption by merchants and when does that get done?","Andy Cecere","Vivek, this is Andy. So the acceleration, the increase is principally due to that EMV. We always sell equipments in any particular quarter, it\u2019s higher in this quarter and last quarter, I would expect it to continue at least for quarter or two, perhaps not at the levels we saw in the third quarter, but it is principally due to that acceleration because merchants are buying chip enabled terminals.","Vivek Juneja","That\u2019s what I thought that it probably accelerated. And the card portfolio you acquired from Auto Club, what was that was in this quarter and how much were the receivables on that Andy?","Andy Cecere","It was $525 million right at the end of the quarter. So, no impact in quarter three; you\u2019ll see that impact in quarter four.","Vivek Juneja","525 million?","Richard Davis","The portfolio looks exactly like our portfolio. I mean from charge-offs to revolve, average spend; it\u2019s right down the fairway and it\u2019s a complete continuation of the kind of service that we provide that quality of customer.","Vivek Juneja","Is it like a private label type portfolio Richard or is it just a regular or co-branded or is it going to be more -- given that it says Auto Club; I would think or is this some kind of affinity type?","Richard Davis","It\u2019s an Auto Club branded card that is with our support and backing. So it\u2019s on our balance sheet, our processing but Auto Club has the rewards that go along with it.","Vivek Juneja","One last thing, consumer banking, if I look at the efficiency ratio that has risen all throughout the last year. Can you talk a little bit about what -- any plans to bring that down or change the direction of that?","Andy Cecere","So Vivek, consumer banking is the most impacted business line by the low rate environment in terms of their earnings as we sit today. So, they have a lot of deposits. Those deposits on a relative basis are below the typical spreads and value that we have on a long-term basis. And that impact is what\u2019s driving their efficiency ratio. So as rates start to move, you will see that business line more than any other start to improve in terms of efficiency ratio.","Richard Davis","That\u2019s why we could be wrong but at least we\u2019re going to have the luxury of deciding later. But branch closures look very attractive now because they\u2019re not only not very profitable, they\u2019re actually going in the wrong direction as this long interest rate stays low and deposit values are much less than they will be in the future. But there will be a time when rates go back up. I know you and I are old enough to remember and deposits will be the governor on how many loans you can make. And that\u2019s the benefit we\u2019re always going to have on these interlopers who are coming in with these great lending ideas. They don\u2019t have the deposits and we shouldn\u2019t give up the one thing we have which is deposits which will be the key driver.","So for us, we have been rationalizing our branch system a lot. We don\u2019t look for headlines on it. We\u2019ve been retooling what happens in the branches all the things that you would expect us to do and closing where they\u2019re necessary and opening with they\u2019re necessary. But we\u2019re by and large a believer in the branch network. We think it\u2019s the best core deposits; it\u2019s best quality customers we get from a branch referred loan or credit line. And yet right now, it\u2019d be a bad time to evaluate their value because at this point at the end of a long recession, they\u2019re not very attractive.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Mutascio with KBW.","Chris Mutascio","I hate to do this to you. I was on another conference call that was running at the same time. Would you remind me hashing just briefly your opening comments about expenses and the kind of initiatives you\u2019re looking through?","Richard Davis","I think I\u2019ll just repeat it for everybody. What we\u2019ve been doing for a year now is watching our FTE assets and be very prudent about where we add them. We\u2019ve recently gone through a rationalization program where our lower performers that were not performing just not the highest level given the importance of an FTE, we\u2019ve now used a company program to do a talent upgrade and effectively use people out of the company. And on top of that, in the last quarter, we added this discretionary expense review which is the other half of the expense categories and started looking at where we don\u2019t need to be spending money at this point in time until rates move. And that\u2019s some we gave some color around. I said that in the quarter four it will be a $10 million to $15 million net benefit that we wouldn\u2019t have had if we hadn\u2019t taken that extra action. For 2016, it will obviously be more than that but we\u2019re not ready to size it because I am also not going to necessarily give you guys a sense that all expenses stop because we\u2019re just reallocating the right things and in some cases we\u2019re going to be investing in places we have been in the past. So too early to rate for \u201816 but definitely net positive and our goal is to get to the positive operating leverage at the minimum annual level starting next year.","Chris Mutascio","I appreciate that and I do apologize for having to rehash that. My one follow-up, Kathy specific to fourth quarter, did you say that expenses will be up over third quarter, and if so was that up from the reported number of about 2.77 billion?","Kathy Rogers","Yes, I would say it\u2019s up from a reported number and that\u2019s principally driven as we said by the fact that our tax credit amortization expense is -- quarter four is our seasonally highest increase related tax credit amortization expense. And we said that that would probably go up in the range of about 65 million to 75 million, similar to what we saw in previous trends. And then you could expect to see that increase being partially offset by some of the elevated costs that we\u2019ve caught out here in quarter three.","Operator","And your final question is from Nancy Bush with NAB Research.","Nancy Bush","Richard, a couple; I can\u2019t remember if it was last quarter or the quarter before, you were sort of the last bank CEO to kind of throw in the towel and say that the economy was getting better, definitively better. Do you want to repeal that now?","Richard Davis","No, I don\u2019t remember being that strong. But I would say it\u2019s not getting worse. I know I said that before. Undeniably it\u2019s not getting worse. I mean things aren\u2019t going backwards; people aren\u2019t going in the direction of not investing; people aren\u2019t afraid to buy cars; people aren\u2019t afraid to use their credit line. I think for a more political discussion, there is the haves and have-nots right in the barbell of who is participating who is not as greater than it used to be. But being a prime only lender and being at a pretty high quality on the line of customers, we\u2019re not impacted mostly by that and we\u2019re feeling a small, slow, steady almost monotonous and I\u2019ll call tortuously flow improvement over the course of time.","I do believe Nancy, I\u2019ve always believed it, I could be totally wrong and happy to be if I am but when the first rate moves, a real move, not a thought of it, not a predilection of it, not a guess of it; I do think that the corporate America starts to move quickly and they\u2019ll start to take advantage first because they have most to gain. And then I think they\u2019ll start to create some incentive -- create consumerism and I think we\u2019re off to the races. I think for the first time business will drive out of the slow recovery than consumers. And I\u2019ll call it recovery because it\u2019s not a recession; it still feels slow and very measured.","So I\u2019m not writing home about it. Without interest rates moving, you just keep seeing us all doing a little more of what we were doing before, managing to the needs of customers who do have the wherewithal and do have the motives, still want to keep growing and benefiting in their lives but plenty of people aren\u2019t playing yet and the savers are getting killed.","Nancy Bush","And a couple quarters before that you had said that you had a long list projects that you wanted to do and that you would start doing them as quickly as the interest rate environment turned but that you were being very cautious on taking on new projects in light of the expense control that was necessary. So, are there any of those projects that are on that list that need to get done, no matter what the interest rate environment is, particularly if this rate environment is going to go on longer than anybody had anticipated?","Richard Davis","Yes, there is two answers to that. One is mobile transitions to banking channels. We\u2019re sending money on that. We\u2019ve talked about our growth; our hundreds of people in Atlanta that work on those topics. I haven\u2019t starved that one bit because that is the changing environment wherein we have to be a leader on that; we\u2019re expected and we have to invest. So that\u2019s a good ROI in the long-term; it\u2019s not a near-term ROI.","The other one Nancy is we\u2019re spending money on compliance. What I\u2019ve learned -- if you\u2019ve heard my speech, it\u2019s like we\u2019ve gone from baggage handlers to pilots, same company. Baggage handlers every once in a while make a mistake and up until now it\u2019s okay, no one loses their lives but pilot from the same company can\u2019t crash a plane. I\u2019d had to move all of our employees from baggage handlers to pilots. So, we\u2019re still in that transition. So, regulators have required that of us as well.","So I\u2019m spending money on either back office or more often than not technology to replace some of the error ridden places where human interaction creates an outcome that is not acceptable anymore. And that investment\u2019s worth it, not because it\u2019s a better product necessarily but because it\u2019s a better compliance outcome, the safer way to earn when you don\u2019t have the potential of penalties and fines and risks.","So those are two things that have not been touched. Other things would be the more attractive ways to just increase the capabilities we do in the back office that no one really sees but it\u2019s just more elegant; less involvement where people have to touch customers where customers can self serve. All those things are -- some of those are nice to have; where they are not required, we\u2019re holding back on those. And those would be the things we\u2019ll add back the minute we start seeing revenue growth.","Operator","I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Sean O\u2019Connor for closing remarks.","Sean O\u2019Connor","Thank you for listening to our review of third quarter results.

Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Kathy Rogers, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon Eastern Daylight time through Friday July 22nd, and 12 midnight Eastern Daylight Time.","I will now turn the conference over to Jen Thompson, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. ","Jennifer Ann Thompson","Thank you, Mellissa. And good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard David, Kathy Rogers, Andy Cecere, Terry Dolan and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s second quarter results and to answer your questions.","Richard and Kathy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbanc.com.","I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking statements are described on page two of today\u2019s presentation and our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Richard. ","Richard K. Davis","Thanks, Jen and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call. I\u2019ll begin our review of U.S. Bank\u2019s results with the summary of reported highlights on slide three of the presentation. I\u2019m pleased to report that U.S. Bank reported record net income of $1.5 billion for the second quarter of 2016 or $0.83 per diluted common share. ","The second quarter results include several notable items that together increased earnings per share by $0.01. These notable items include $180 million of equity investment income, primarily the result of our membership in Visa Europe, which was recently sold to Visa Incorporated. Additionally we recognized $110 million in accruals related to legal and regulatory matters and the $40 million charitable contribution. I\u2019m very pleased with our second quarter results where we once again delivered industry leading profitability and posted record results for revenue, net income and earnings per share on both a reported as well as a core basis.","Record revenues were driven by growth in average linked quarter loans of 1.6% as expected and continued strength in our fee businesses. While we saw a reduction in our linked quarter net interest margin as expected, we did report modest linked quarter growth in net interest income and strong growth in net interest income on a year-over-year basis.","Total average deposit growth also remained strong at 7.6% versus the previous year, and included net income growth -- net new income account growth of 2.8%. Credit quality was stable for the second quarter as expected. The net charge-off ratio was unchanged at 48 basis points compared to the previous quarter and the previous year. And we recognized a modest improvement in non-performing assets, which was driven mainly by improvements in the energy credits. ","Slide five provides you with a five quarter history of our profitability metrics, which continue to be among the best in the industry.","Moving to the graph on the right, you will see that this quarter\u2019s net interest margin was 3.02%, 4 basis points lower than the prior quarter, which was in line with our expectations. The industry continues to face headwinds from low interest rate environment and the flatter yield curve, which became more pronounced at the end of the second quarter and continues as we begin the third quarter. ","The lower long-term rates will have an impact on our second half results, if the rates remain at these low historic levels. We would that given the current yield curve and expectations that the short-term rates will remain flat for the near-team, that the interest margin -- net interest margin will decline on a linked basis in the range of 3 to 4 basis points. However, we also expect net interest income to increase on a linked quarter basis, principally driven by an increase in earning assets. ","Expenses excluding the notable items increase 3.4% at the bottom end of our expected range. And our efficiency ratio improved to 54% versus 54.6% in the prior fiscal quarter. As projected, quarter two expenses included a linked quarter increase in marketing expense related to the investment in our brand advertising, and also reflect the expected peak in our compliance related costs. ","As we look out to the second half of the year, we\u2019d expect expenses to grow, however, the rate of growth will be lower than the 3.4% linked quarter growth reported in the second quarter. ","Turning to slide six, the company reported record net revenue of $5.4 million in the second quarter. Excluding the Visa Europe sales, revenue increased $226 million or 4.5% from the prior year. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by core loan growth, as well as strength in a number of our fee based businesses, including our payments, mortgage and wealth management businesses.","We also saw strong results from our capital markets business, as we were well positioned to provide product and services to customers as they navigated through the recent market volatility.","Kathy will now provide you with more details about our second quarter results.","Kathy Rogers","Thanks, Richard. Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on slide seven. Average total loans outstanding grew 1.6% on a linked quarter basis and increased by over $20 billion or 8.1% compared with the second quarter of 2015.","Excluding the recent retail card portfolio acquisition and student loans that were carried in the held for sale in the second quarter of 2015 loans grew by 6.5% compared to the prior year.","In the second quarter, the year-over-year increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 10.7% and improved residential mortgage loan growth of 8.6%. Other consumer loans continue to show positive momentum, led by credit card growth of 14.3%, which included the retail card acquisition.","Finally, home equity loan growth continued reflecting the year-over-year increase of 2.7%. On a linked quarter basis, our core loan growth of 1.6% meeting our expectation, and was driven by total commercial loan growth of $2.3 billion or 2.6%, and growth in residential mortgages of $1.3 billion, or 2.4%.","We currently project linked quarter average loan growth in quarter three to be similar to the growth reported in prior quarters. Total average deposits increased $22 billion or 7.6% compared with the second quarter of 2015, and were up 3.9% on a linked quarter basis.","On a year-over-year basis, the trend continues to reflect strong growth of 9.5% in our low cost deposits, which includes our non-interest bearing and low cost interest checking deposits and more than offset the run-off in higher cost time deposits.","Turning to Slide eight, as Richard mentioned, credit quality remain relatively stable in the second quarter. Second quarter net charge-off increased $21 million or 7.1% compared with the prior year, and reflected a modest increase of $2 million or 0.6% on a linked quarter basis.","Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans were 48 basis points in the second quarter, unchanged from the prior quarter and the prior year. Compared with a year ago non-performing asset increased $95 million or 6% mostly due to the down grade that occurred in prior quarter due to recent energy credits. Linked quarter non-performing assets improved 3% or $47 million driven mainly from improvements in our energy credits.","Slide nine provides an update of our energy exposure. At the end of the second quarter $3 billion of our commercial loans and $11.3 billion of our commitments were to customers in the energy portfolio, which was down from the previous quarter. The decline was primarily driven by the completion of our spring borrowing base redetermination on reserve-based loans within our energy portfolio.","During the second quarter criticized commitments within this portfolio decreased $509 million while nonperforming loans decreased $54 million principally driven by pay down. Finally credit reserve associated with the energy portfolio declined by $45 million, reflective of reduced loans which resulted in an 8.8% credit reserve for our energy portfolio compared to 9.1% in the previous quarter. Given the underlying mix in quality of the overall portfolio we expect linked net charge-off and total provision expense to be relatively stable in the third quarter of 2016.","Slide 10 gives you a view of our second quarter results versus comparable period. Second quarter net income excluding notable items increased by $17 million or 1.1% on a year-over-year basis. Higher operating income was partially offset by higher provision expense. On a linked quarter basis net income excluding notable items decreased by $114 million or 8.2% mainly due to the seasonality in certain fee businesses partially offset by higher non-interest expense related to expected increases in compliance cost and marketing expense. The marketing expense represents our brand advertising.","Turning to slide 11, net interest income increased by $126 million or 4.5% on a year-over-year basis. Strong average earning asset growth was slightly offset by the impact of a 1 basis point decline in net interest margin to 3.02%. The modest year-over-year decline in net interest margin primarily reflected the impact of higher short-term rate offset by lower reinvestment rates in the security portfolio.","Net interest income increased by $8 million or 0.3% on a linked quarter basis. Strong growth in average loans was offset by a 4 basis point reduction in net interest margin. The decline in the margin was principally due to the loan portfolio mix as well as lower average rates on the investment securities portfolio, which is principally due to flatter yield curves.","Slide 12 highlights non-interest income, which increase $100 million or 4.4% year-over-year excluding the Visa Europe sale. The year-over-year increase in non-interest income was primarily due to increase in payments revenue, trust and investment management fees, mortgage banking fees and commercial product fees, which is mainly due to the increased capital market fee -- which was mainly due to increased capital market fees resulting from the recent market volatility.","Credit and debit card fees grew by $30 million or 11.3%, reflecting higher transaction volumes including acquired portfolios. Corporate payment products revenue grew 1.7% reversing a negative growth trend recognized during the previous year and this was driven mostly by market share gains resulting from prior year investments made within our middle market, virtual payment and commercial freight platforms.","Merchant processing services increased 2.0% year-over-year or 3% excluding the impact of current foreign currency rate changes. Commercial products revenue increased $24 million or 11.2%, driven by higher bond underwriting fees and other capital market activities as our customers responded to the recent volatilities. On a linked quarter basis non-interest excluding the Visa Europe sale increased $223 million or 10.4% principally due to seasonally higher fees within our payments mortgage banking and desposit service charge fee category.","Credit and debit card fees increased $30 million or 11.3% and merchant processing fees increased $30 million or 8.0% primarily due to seasonally higher transaction volumes. Commercial product fees increased $41 million or 21%, mortgage banking fees increased $51 million or 27%, which was inline with our previous guidance of 20% to 30%. Growth in mortgage banking revenues primarily reflected seasonally higher production volumes. We currently expect linked quarter mortgage fees to increase 20% to 30% again in quarter three.","Moving to slide 13, non-interest expense excluding notable items increased $160 million or 6% on a year-over-year basis; higher compensation expense mostly due to the impact of merit increases and variable compensation. Higher professional service expense principally related to compliance activity and higher marketing and business development expense related to the investment in our brand advertising were partially offset by lower employee benefit expense. ","On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense excluding notable items increased by $93 million or 3.4%. Linked quarter expense growth was driven by higher marketing and business development cost again reflective of the investment in brand advertising. Higher professional service fees -- expenses principally due to compliance and an increase in compensation expense mostly due to merit increases. These increased costs were partially offset by seasonally lower employee benefit expense.","As Richard mentioned, we expect expenses to grow in the second half of the year however at a lower rate of growth versus the 3.4% excluding notable items that we\u2019ve reported for the second quarter. Our current expectation is for linked expenses to increase 2.5% to 3% in the third quarter, but so let me provide some additional detail. We anticipate that the FDIC search charge assessment for larger banks will begin in the third quarter which will increase our expenses by approximately $20 million. Additionally, expenses related to our tax credit business are seasonally higher as we move into third quarter. These two items account for more than half of the expected quarterly expense growth.","In the second quarter, preferred dividend totaled $80 million, which compared with $51 million in the first quarter of 2016. The linked quarter increase is reflected of recent preferred stock issuances with a semi-annual dividend payment that will repeat again in quarter four. ","Turning to slide 14, our capital position remains strong and in the second quarter we returned 77% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buyback. On June 29th, we announced that Federal Reserve did not object to our capital plan. As a result, we announced the $2.6 billion stock buyback program that commenced on July 1st and announced an expected increase in our third quarter common dividend of 9.8%. We would expect to remain in our targeted payout range of 60% to 80% going forward.","Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented at June 30 was 9.3% which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirements. Our tangible book value per share rose to $18.46 at June 30th, representing 10% increase over the same quarter of last year and 3% over the prior quarter.","I will now turn the call back to Richard.","Richard K. Davis","Thanks, Kathy. I am proud of our record second quarter results. We maintained our industry leading performance measures and we reported an 18.7% return on tangible common equity in the quarter. Our industry continues to face challenges from the low interest rate environment. However we remain confident that we\u2019ll continue to grow revenue and prudently manage expenses while strategically investing in our business to create value for our shareholders. ","That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Kathy, Terry, Bill and I will now be happy to answer your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John McDonald with Bernstein. ","Richard K. Davis","Hi, John.","John McDonald","Hi, good morning guys. Richard I was hoping if you could provide a little bit color on loan growth. What\u2019s gotten better and what\u2019s keeping you the confidence the expected trend to continue? It sounds like you might expect more of the same maybe little bit more color there.","Richard K. Davis","Sure happy to do it. And we\u2019re expecting more of the same pretty much what we\u2019ve seen for the last two quarters. I\u2019ll have Andy to give a little color on the detail as he oversees all of those revenue businesses. But I will say it continues to be a theme of repetitive quarter-after-quarter. Where on the wholesale side, you\u2019re seeing increased capital markets activity that in fact move up and trigger loan repayments and lower line utilization and M&A related activity.","So on the wholesale side, we\u2019re not still not seeing the kind of organic growth we\u2019d like to see, but we are pleased as we said in our comments that we have a fully capable capital markets business in order to take the benefit of what would otherwise be some activities we didn\u2019t use to have in the company when customers moved outside of the lending market and into the capital markets.","On the consumer side we\u2019re seeing all areas moving slowly, but surely and nicely, favorably from autos to RVs to credit card to home equity. And then we particularly have good story to tell in the mortgage business as we continue to be a bigger player in that area.","So it\u2019s a lot of the same John, but everything has got generally positive slightly positive bias, but a lot of the opportunity that wholesale market is yet to be the kind of organic growth that we all want to see that gets evidenced in a more healthy and robust economic environment. Andy, do you want to add some color there?","Andrew J. Cecere","Richard, I\u2019d add in that. So we did see record revenue in our commercial products groups and you saw that our credit fixed income, or FX or municipal products all were up at record levels, somewhere between 40% and 50% on a year-over-year basis, and again, that\u2019s reflective of a tremendous bond issuance that was occurring here in the second quarter. We did continue to see strength in auto lending as well as residential mortgages again principally due to the rise in the jump [Inaudible] and commercial real estate also grew a bit this quarter also, which is a little bit of a reversal of the trend.","John McDonald","And maybe Bill can follow-up. You had good credit results this quarter, I think the outlook was for a relatively stable, I was just wondering, if you might need to build some reserves, if the loan growth remains healthy here?","P. W. Parker","Well, I mean, we\u2019ve started that. So we are adding, we\u2019re done with the days of releasing and we are adding to our reserve. So we are mindful of that. As I said for quite a period, there is still probably room in the existing portfolios, specifically residential, home equity, where we do have -- we continue to see improvements in home values, et cetera. So that could allow for releases out of those portfolios, which does help offset some of the loan growth. But we are in a position, where we feel it\u2019s prudent to be adding to our overall reserves.","John McDonald","And is this quarter a pretty good indicative pace for now Bill?","P. W. Parker","For now.","John McDonald","Okay. And in terms of the NPAs and charge-offs can you just repeat what your outlook is there?","P. W. Parker","Yeah it\u2019s pretty -- very stable really across the board. I mean, if you look at each of the asset classes C&I is surprisingly low in this quarter, we had -- we felt we were very got out ahead of the energy issues in the first quarter, and this quarter we had no material energy charge-offs, in fact we have nice recovery on one of our credits. So we feel like we\u2019ve got the energy with $50 a barrel anyway, that we have the energy issue behind us. And if you look at the other asset class, it\u2019s all very stable.","Richard K. Davis","Just add to that, Bill I would add, we marked our portfolio at $35 a barrel for the second quarter. And we have no intention of releasing that reserve for some time and we see sustained higher levels of value on oil, but we do have at 8.8%, we think sufficient coverage and provision, and we\u2019re quite pleased with how that portfolio is behaving at this point.","John McDonald","Okay, thanks.","Richard K. Davis","Thanks, John.","Operator","Your next question is from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital.","Richard K. Davis","Hey, Jon.","Jon Arfstrom","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe Richard, a question for you, expenses. Maybe about a year ago, you gave the chin up bar analogy on rates remain low; you might have to be tougher on expenses. I appreciate all the guidance, it looks like maybe professional services can start to moderate a bit maybe marketing to maybe there is some other offset, but maybe your latest thoughts long-term expense management, efficiency if the rate environment remains challenging.","Richard K. Davis","Yeah, I appreciate that. So a picture of the bar fell up there, promising [ph] like crazy. Both knuckles are white, but we\u2019re hanging in there. A couple of thoughts Jon, I want to start by saying, I\u2019ll give you guys forward looking view that we intent at this point, at least for the second half of the year to stay in the 54% range. 54.0% to 54.9% kind of a range in our efficiency ratio.","And I\u2019m giving you that, because I don\u2019t know exactly with no interest rates, flat -- very flat yield curve and that can move either than can move anytime and it seem to be very volatile. We\u2019re not giving up on positive operating leverage, but it\u2019s getting a lot harder. And I\u2019d rather just tell you guys that we\u2019re going to stay at the same current level and we\u2019ve been there for a couple of quarters now of efficiency. Because what I\u2019m saying is we already are under a pretty steady and measured expense control program.","We\u2019ve got an FTE hold in the company that look for any growth items and areas of compliance. We haven\u2019t added those now since February of last year, and we continue to watch all the non-critical expenses, the discretionary expenses to a point that we think is it\u2019s right up to the line, where it would start to impair our new growth. And you guys invest in us not just for this quarter or next quarter, but for the long-term, and we\u2019re going to be very careful not to over react. And we have been careful so far not to do that. ","So our expenses will go up as we said less than the 3.4% linked quarter, next quarter would be 2.5% to 3%. And as Kathy mentioned, half of that will in the FDIC premium cost and in the CDC, which typically has higher expenses in the second half. So rest is just core part of adding people for portfolios, adding to compliance. And as you said, professional services starts it did peak this quarter starts to come down. So I\u2019ll tell you it comes down very slowly. So it\u2019s not a big measured improvement. But it is at least a point in fact that this will be our highest quarter I hope on record.","So that gives you a little more color and I think the 54% range that gives us enough room to have surprises during the quarter, but also protect the knowledge for you that we\u2019re not going to do something it get to 52 and I don\u2019t see this thing moving into 55s or 56s.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe quickly just an update on the consent order and once lifted what really changes in your mind?","Richard K. Davis","Sure. So the consent order as you know is preclude us from whole bank transactions particularly things with branch banking and as we go through this consent order it takes quite some time not only to get things where they need to be, but to sustain and improve that they stay there and we are in those processes now. So I have no idea what the exit time will be, but we are working closely with our regulators to make sure that we have permissions particularly to be released from any part of the consent order first if that\u2019s helpful to us to get back into the traditional M&A business.","However, I remind you that our M&A in the area of merchant portfolios, credit card portfolios, mortgage business activities, trust activities none of those are precluded under that order and those have been exactly the things we have in the last five years consistently as part of our M&A.","So we haven\u2019t been precluded from doing what we wanted to do and as I said before there hasn\u2019t been a bank deal or a branch deal that we wanted since the Citizens Chicago deal that we\u2019ve included from. So our goal is to get out of it as soon as possible so we don\u2019t have any barriers on our options. But for now it\u2019s not impairing any of ability to run the company or find opportunities to acquire.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay, great. Thank you.","Richard K. Davis","Thanks, Jon.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Miller with FBR and Company.","Richard K. Davis","Good morning, Paul.","Timothy Hayes","Hey, guys. This is actually Tim Hayes for Paul Miller. What is your view for mortgage revenues in the second half of the year given where interest rates are today, are you guys seeing any pick up in resize yet and do you think that\u2019s a tailwind to fee income from lower rates could offset the detriment to margin?","Andrew J. Cecere","This is Andrew replying. So our second quarter mix was about 65% new purchases and 35% refinancing. So I would expect that to go closer to 60-40 in the second quarter and given that coupled with the normal seasonality I would expect mortgage fees to continue to increase in that 20% to 30% range.","Timothy Hayes","Okay, great. Thank you.","Andrew J. Cecere","Sure.","Operator","The next question is from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.","Richard K. Davis","Hi, John.","John Pancari","Good morning. I wonder if you can give us a little bit more color on the merchant processing revenue it looks like a little bit light from where I was looking for this quarter, I just want to see if we can get some of your updated trends that you are seeing on the merchant side? And then separately for the payments business just overall revenue trends that you can expect here I know we\u2019ve seen a pretty good rebound in that business, but wanted to get some color on your outlook. Thanks.","Andrew J. Cecere","Okay. This is Andy again. Let me start with merchant and you are right there are a few moving pieces in merchant I want to explain. So first one of the principal drivers of merchant fee revenue is same store sales. And same store sales in North America were up just under 2%, 1.8% and in Europe they were up about 5%. So globally up about 2.6% and what you typically see from us is same store sales plus 1% to 2% is total merchant revenue growth. ","What happened this quarter is while we were up 2% on a year-over-year basis if you exclude FX that\u2019s up 3% that is also now flattening now revenue related to equipment sales. So we were up higher in prior quarters because equipment sales were going up, they are sort of leveled up, we\u2019ve lapped that so to speak.","The other things you will see are transaction volume is down and that was intentional. We exited some low margin business, so it did have impact on transaction volume, but as you saw not a tremendous impact on fee income. So as we look forward to the next few quarter I would expect again same store sales plus 1% to 2% in terms of our fee growth in merchant volume.","You asked about the other payments business so let me comment on that. Credit card is very strong. Excluding fidelity we were up about 6% and that\u2019s driven by card transaction volume growth of about 7% and I would expect that to continue in the future quarters. And then finally on corporate payment systems, very good story there is that we are seeing growth in the corporate side of the equation. While government is continuing to be flat our corporate fee income is growing, transaction volume, sales volumes up about 6% and that\u2019s a function of the investments we made in virtual pay and product activity, which is very positive. So T&E continues to be weak or level or down a bit, but payables and virtual pay is up strong.","Richard K. Davis","I\u2019ll add to that, this is Richard. Just if you are going to bring up proxy question I\u2019ll help you out here. For Brexit, first of all it\u2019s not material and it\u2019s pretty neutral to the bank. But if it shows up anywhere it shows up in our European businesses, which is merchant acquiring. You may recall those of you who followed us for a decade, we started our business merchant acquiring business in the UK that\u2019s where it\u2019s actually headquartered. So a disproportion amount of business is in the UK. And actually if there is a lot of prognosis I believe there will be a lot of travel and visits and spending over the UK which is net positive for us.","And given our portfolio mix being heavy on hotels, retail, hoteliers and airlines that could be quite positive as well offsetting any variances that may occur in the rest of the European market through this disruption. So we\u2019re seeing Brexit as fairly neutral to not material to maybe even little bit positive. ","As it relates to our employees, we have a few hundred employees that are working in the UK and or in around Europe that would either have to have past reporting circumstances change for them because they\u2019re either UK employees working in Europe or European employees working in the UK that\u2019s something that will roll over the next couple of years. There is no rush to it and there has been no reaction there we\u2019re not changing any of our strategies as a result of that.","John Pancari","Okay great. Thanks for all that color, it\u2019s helpful. And then just separately on the commercial real estate portfolio, pretty good growth this quarter and looking actually at the construction piece saw a pretty good jump there. So wanted to see what you\u2019re seeing on the commercial real estate side in terms of where the growth is coming from? And do you expect any moderation from regulatory scrutiny around CRE trends right now at all. And then lastly any credit concerns on that front because we\u2019re hearing a little of that too? Thanks.","Richard K. Davis","Yeah I will go first, I want to go first on that. CRE has got as you know for our company is one of the areas we want to be particularly conservative in much as we love it and we\u2019re very big in it. And so the scrutiny it\u2019s high in the industry I\u2019m quite comfortable that the scrutiny will not be placed here because we\u2019ve been conservative for a decade and we continue to be underwriting. I\u2019ll also remind you that commercial real estate has a CMBS market where there is a lot of activity. And our guys are filling it with a lack of buyers coming particularly from the life insurers has affect the refinance and purchase activity, which only serves to say that there is a reduced pace to payoffs.","So part of the increase is actually good news we\u2019re keeping the customers we have. But we\u2019re not striving to get new customers at any kind of risk of underwriting or at pricing change. I think the portfolio will prove itself more overtime.","Andy and Bill can add little color about where the growth is and where we see the pockets of strength. But we love this business; we\u2019re very good at it. But I promise you we\u2019re just not going to get greedy at a time like this in the marketplace on terms or underwriting. Because it\u2019s easy to do and it\u2019s not going to happen here. So Andy you might go first.","Andrew J. Cecere","Well to follow-up on Richard\u2019s point. If you look at our construction loan activity, you see that that\u2019s been increasing fairly consistently over the last five or more quarters. What\u2019s changed is that commercial mortgage or standing loan permanent loan where the attrition has declined and actually reversed this quarter, very slight increase. And that was what Richard was highlighting. I mean the strength has been it continues to be on the coast especially the West Coast for us and through a lot of our REIT clients they have been very active.","P. W. Parker","And that's what I was going to say. California, Pacific Northwest is where we\u2019re seeing insurance activity. ","John Pancari","Great, all right. Thank you. ","Richard K. Davis","You\u2019re welcome. ","Operator","Your next question is from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. ","Richard K. Davis","Hey, Scott.","Scott Siefers","Good morning, everybody. Richard I was hoping either you or Kathy could extend upon your comments on the margin from the beginning of the call. First I want to make sure I understood it correctly. I think when you characterize they\u2019re down 3 to 4 basis points. I think you were talking about the second half, but is that three to four basis points per quarter in the second half or in the aggregate for the second half. And then I guess the broader question there is, at what point would you guess that margin compression would stop in this kind of pressure grade environment? Because I guess there are two big issues with the securities portfolio reinvestment risk and then there is still kind of wide gap between your loan and deposit growth. But just curious to hear your thoughts on both of those phenomenon.","Richard K. Davis","Yeah thanks, Scott. I think we got to question five before we got to NIM, that\u2019s pretty good. I\u2019ll be very clear, what we said it was in quarter three which is all we can see into. We have a 3 to 4 basis point prediction of NIM decrease. I have no idea what quarter four would be. As we woke up this morning, you know that the call for interest rate increases is 21% for September, 36% for December. Better than zero worse than it was when we talked last time. So we\u2019re not going to bet on any of that, but to the extent that any of it comes back would be terrific. Also the 10 years above 150 again thank god. That is helpful to us as interest rate increases. And you know there is an equal impact on the income statement based on that. ","So if we can manage through these very worse time which is continued zero interest rate increases and very, very low tenure. We can manage through just about anything which is how we\u2019re building the lower for longer kind of term around the company.","So for one quarter we can see that pressure. We can\u2019t predict beyond that. I\u2019ll have Kathy talk a bit more about the sequencing and the importance of the refinancing that occurs in the securities. And the fact that we\u2019re actually seeing stable performance in most margin areas for compression as it relates to competitors.","Kathy Rogers","Yeah. So well he is exactly right. We\u2019re looking at into the third quarter and we are down about -- we are projecting that we\u2019re going to be down in that range of 3 to 4. But I\u2019m going to say it\u2019s going to be a lot more of what you\u2019ve seen. So as the rate curve has kind of flattened although some signs of improvement here most recently. That\u2019s going to continue to have an impact on our securities portfolio. So we\u2019ll continue to see a decline in that. ","And then the rest really you have to look to our loan growth to the extent that we continue to grow our wholesale loans little bit stronger than our retail loan that\u2019s also going to put a little bit of compression going forward.","Richard K. Davis","So Scott, let it be said at the end, we remind you that net interest income will increase in quarter three. So we can out [ph] on this in the outset growth, but it\u2019s going to be continued more challenging until we get interest rate increases around that.","Scott Siefers","Okay, terrific. Thank you guys very much. ","Richard K. Davis","Thanks. ","Operator","Your next question is from Ken Houston with Jefferies. ","Richard K. Davis","Hi, Ken. ","Kenneth Houston","Hey, good morning everyone. Just as a follow-up on just the balance sheet mix, with still have a really good loan-to-deposit ratio. You\u2019re still growing deposits and I see you\u2019re able to remix from the short-term borrowings this quarter. Given that low rate scenario we\u2019re dealing with, at what point do you decide to just try to remix just more into loans less into securities given and understanding that you need to keep LCR. But does anything structural change with that thought process around just asset liability management?","Richard K. Davis","No it doesn\u2019t Ken. And we\u2019re nowhere near those lines. I mean we take what the market gives us and then make sure that we apply it appropriately to the balance sheet and therefore the income statement. But there is no -- we're not near any of the line where we\u2019re evaluating the value of even deposits. We're self-collecting deposits and happy to take them because they will be more necessary in the future. And we\u2019re pricing loans at the right level to win the high quality and the securities portfolio is kind of a result of all of that. But it wouldn\u2019t be a driver it would be a follower. And there is nothing in our strategy that\u2019s going to change at this stage. And there is nothing that\u2019s getting us close to edge where we have to sit down and strategize on our balance sheet as it relates to a mix or an area of that appetite that we haven\u2019t already demonstrated.","Kenneth Houston","Understood. And then on the deposit side, I think a lot of banks are starting to still see a modest tick ups on the deposit pricing side. What are you guys just seeing in terms of customer behavior in terms of product choice and any cost that you have to hand along even though we\u2019re not really getting it on the left side of the balance sheet?","Kathy Rogers","Yeah, we really haven\u2019t seen a whole lot of shift. Really the consumer has really no rate change whatsoever on the consumer. We talked previously that we did have some repricing on our wholesale side some of that was just contractual that happened to other if as we work with our customers. But I\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s been relatively stable as we look into this quarter.","Kenneth Houston ","Okay. Last one real quick one, the preferred dividend Kathy, does it go back to the first quarter 57 in the third quarter?","Kathy Rogers","Yeah. So it\u2019s a quarterly payment. So first and third quarter will be at the lower rate, second and fourth quarter will be at the higher. Yeah about 60 I would say, 60 in the third quarter, about 80 in the fourth quarter. ","Kenneth Houston","Okay, thank you. ","Richard K. Davis","I am glad you asked that because that gotten just neither didn\u2019t telegraph well or just gotten missed in a lot of the models. And it\u2019s real money and it's also real value. So I\u2019m glad to have that clarity. Thanks for asking it. ","Kenneth Houston","You bet. ","Operator","Your next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA. ","Mike Mayo","Good morning, Richard. So in the battle Richard Davis, first the tenure I think you\u2019re kind of getting obliterated.","Richard K. Davis","I think so. They are definitely winning, I\u2019ll tell you that. ","Mike Mayo","On the other hand, you do have some accelerating loan growth. I know you talked about loan growth here. So originally you\u2019ve mentioned economic growth couple of years ago accelerating, improving and then tenure goes down and that\u2019s why I brought the comment initially. So if you look at the tenure you\u2019re really loosing, if you look at your accelerating loan growth maybe you\u2019re winning a little bit more. So I\u2019m just trying to make sense of as the markets for you do business improving or not?","Richard K. Davis","Mike it\u2019s a great question. They are improving slowly, but I\u2019ll tell you what, I wish I\u2019ll be here 10 years from now to prove that, but we are taking market share, swear to god honest Injun. We are taking market share. We have been for years. Think of our home equity portfolio it\u2019s still growing, albeit slightly, but that\u2019s been shrinking across the industry. Auto loans we\u2019ve never got not of it, so we are selling it big, leasing or now one of the few players literally quite capable at it we\u2019ve been doubling down on credit cards and you are seeing some of our recent portfolio and partnerships. So it\u2019s mostly in market share, there is not a market that\u2019s actually weaker than it was a year ago, but for intents and purposes there is not a market much stronger than it was either.","And what I think really turns on the dial for banks is when corporate America is more confident and I don\u2019t mean the original old unconfident we\u2019re always uncertain. But things with a Presidential Election in the offering things like Brexit uncertainties we don\u2019t need any of the things like that to continue to give corporate America a reason to just wait and but for M&A and for restructuring their balance sheet corporate America is not organically doing big things at least not needing banks in that process.","So that\u2019s when the thing really starts to take-off. But in the meantime we are all getting it out in the trenches, trying to keep more customers and do more with the ones we have. And I just think the right answer as much as it\u2019s hard to prove is that we are doing it in our case with market share growth.","Mike Mayo","And so the answer to my question -- that is helpful. But if you strip all that away do you think things are improving generally or not or it\u2019s just kind of the same old?","Richard K. Davis","I think I meant to say every market is a little stronger than it was last year. So yes, but not very much.","Mike Mayo","Okay. All right, great. Thanks a lot.","Richard K. Davis","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Richard K. Davis","Good morning, Erika.","Erika Najarian","Good morning. I was wondering if you could share a little bit of color on the CCAR results. I was a little bit surprised how the regional banks faired in terms of their stress ratios or PPNR assumptions relative to last year. I am wondering if there is any color that you could share with your investor base on that? And also Richard I\u2019m wondering if the CCAR results and how acquirers were treated in this year\u2019s results at all impact your thinking about future acquisitions?","Richard K. Davis","Let me say first of all we were very pleased with our CCAR results. I always joke at the stress test and it\u2019s effective because we are stressed the whole time. Also be reminded we haven\u2019t had the final exit exams on all the details and you also know we\u2019ll never know exactly how the model works. But I\u2019ll remind you that in this particular cycle the negative interest rate scenario was added and that\u2019s hard for any of us to predict exactly how that fair for each bank. But I know that that had an impact on what was likely the PPNR for every bank.","As you know we continue to be at the top on the PPNR bearly in this case we are slightly below break even, but in the years past we\u2019ve always been above and I think on a relative basis we even performed better. So I\u2019m not concerned about trying to predict that and I think that the test continues to be effective in helping us all understand whether or not on a most stressed scenario we would be okay.","Acquirers had more limited capital distribution and so we don\u2019t think that\u2019s a factor to us because it\u2019s not as relevant to us as it will be some others. But I think as you look at the stress test results and you apply it across different kinds of companies it\u2019s not unusual to see different distribution model based on both what we are starting from, what the stress test would do to us and where we would end.","Erika Najarian","So essentially it doesn\u2019t impact how you are thinking about understanding that you have a consent order in place. But it doesn\u2019t impact your thinking about how to manage capital for future acquisition.","Richard K. Davis","No, I mean emphatically no, in fact it doesn\u2019t have any impact on it at all. What we wanted to do is we want to continue to understand the best methodologies that they use in stress testing the loan portfolio. So we can better understand what mechanics are in there so we can predict those better than we have in the past. But we also continue to outperform on the PPNR as it relates to their satisfaction in the model with how much money we\u2019ll make. So it works both ways but every year we get smarter every year we go back and do our best to evaluate it and as I said we are a little bit early on getting any formal feedback which we\u2019ll be getting in the next couple of weeks between this and the next time we talk.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And just as a follow-up question. Really appreciate the color on how to think about payments revenues as we think about forecasting. Could you give us a sense of how much of your payments revenues are generated in pounds so we can think about translation risk?","Andrew J. Cecere","The translation is rather limited. So if you think about every 1% change it\u2019s about $1 million it\u2019s not a big number, Erika.","Erika Najarian","Got it, thank you.","Richard K. Davis","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","Richard K. Davis","Hi, Vivek.","Vivek Juneja","Hi. Couple of follow-up. Firstly on CCAR, your current cost are at the high end compared to last year, can you comment on your thoughts on the results that are showing up there?","Kathy Rogers","Yes. And I think really where you see that is particularly within our wholesale portfolio. And that\u2019s been something we\u2019ve been working on for quite a few years. I think we have tended to be on the higher side -- the Fed has been a little bit on the higher side. We don\u2019t have a whole lot of input into -- insight into what some of their modeling routines are, as you know it\u2019s relatively a black pot. But perhaps, we\u2019re thinking perhaps that, if you think about where our utilization rates and so forth that could have a play we\u2019re relatively low on a utilization side, but we are actually, as you notice, we project a lot lower risk in a downturn environment than the Fed and we\u2019re just going to continue to share to work through that and try and figure out where the differences lie.","Richard K. Davis","So Vivek, this is a point of frustration for me, because we in the first couple of years, I was really worried, if we were different than them how bigger deal could that be. I will say that history is probably now better dictate than testing itself. And if you look in the last seven years, which is exact timeframe that we\u2019ve got the stress test our commercial portfolios outperformed almost everybody and done very, very well.","And so, I\u2019m not challenging the test, I\u2019m just challenging that we\u2019re never going to figure out what they put in, Kathy gave you a hint. We think our commitments have been growing faster than anybody, well in addition to our loan growth. And I think if they take a model where all the commitments go to 100%, and they go to charge-off, that could be it. We have a big government portfolio in our corporate business, which if they take a 90 day late pay and take the whole portfolio to charge-off, maybe that could be it.","And as simple as it sounds, we\u2019ll never get the answer, even to those questions I just offered. So what we will do is continue to watch our own performance as you should measure the dictate on how well we\u2019ve actually done in charge-offs and non-performs over the course of time. So we\u2019ll just do our best to get closer on that test. But we don\u2019t understand exactly ourselves, how it test like it does, when the results themselves show that way.","Vivek Juneja","Okay, thanks. One more, capital markets, you have grown very strongly Richard. As you continue to do that, does that shift what you\u2019re thinking in terms of -- so that\u2019s been one of the strongest fee growth driver this quarter, and you\u2019re trying to grow underwriting. Does that shift what you are thinking from a capital standpoint, where especially when you look at peers, et cetera?","Richard K. Davis","Vivek, I would say it doesn\u2019t shift, it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s a reflection of what\u2019s occurring in the market. We\u2019ve had traditionally two strong growth areas in fees, trust and our payments group, and it\u2019s great to have this third area come in and started taking what the market gives us. And given this low rate environment and the volatility, things like credit fixed income FX are very strong as well as derivatives. So it\u2019s great that we have these businesses, which in fact 10 years ago we didn\u2019t have. So it\u2019s a positive add to the fee businesses that we have. ","Vivek Juneja","Right. But given that it\u2019s a higher volatility business would that not mean that as you think about economic capital, but when you\u2019ve talked about 8% or 8.5% in the past that that starts to migrate slightly upwards.","Richard K. Davis","No. I wouldn\u2019t expect that to have any impact on our capital ratio at all.","Vivek Juneja","Okay, thanks.","Richard K. Davis","Sure. ","Operator","Your next question is from Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Richard K. Davis","Hi, Bill.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Good morning. Richard, I had a question on your P2P money transfer product. How are you thinking about the potential disintermediation risk that clear exchange could pose to the revenues that you generate on the card issuing side of your business? Or are there any restrictions that you could put in place to prevent potential disintermediation?","Richard K. Davis","Good question, Bill. First of all, we are clear exchanges [ph]. So we\u2019re going to be on either side of that transaction. But I\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s the same answer I gave three years ago with Square, when Square started coming out big with Starbucks, and at least for now not for long-term, but for now, most of these transactions are taking money out of this, cash out of the system not other card, debit or credit transactions. There is still so much cash in our system, in our society, there is plenty of disintermediation of cash a long before it starts to tap up against the other card businesses and that\u2019s what we are all planning for in the near-term and that could be a couple of years.","But short beyond that period of time, we all have to be very thoughtful and your question is right on the money, as it relates to what\u2019s the evolving relationship between real time Pay-to-Pay, card, card not present, and the mobility of people moving money about in the different environment. ","Remember we\u2019re still under a Federal Reserve circumstance that settles overnight and not over the weekend. So there is still a big disconnect and we have those things to fix systemically, before we get to a real time payment. But for now, disintermediation is mostly seen on cash and that\u2019s a net positive for us in the other banks, because that we have no benefit in cash moving about for the most part, we do when it starts to monetize itself in the form of the payment. ","Bill Carcache","Right. But maybe just as a follow-up, I guess the nature of that product is really for clear exchange where P2P money transfer between individuals not necessary to conduct a payment transaction. But I guess to the extent that you were and given your position as both acquirer and issuer you would be in a very good position to see to the extent to which people who are using the product to actually conduct payment transactions in lieu of USB credit card. And if that were the case is that something that you would expect to be monitoring and rack to as appropriate to the extent that we\u2019re having a revenue impact.","Andrew J. Cecere","I think the principle -- this is Andy. I think the principal activity today is as Richard mentioned is cash and is also check individual-to-individual. I think the second category that will occur is for people to pay bills. And the bill payment again is going to be a replacement for check and or online checking. So it is in the bill pay so to speak. So in the interim or in the immediate timeframe I don't think there is any negative at all and we\u2019ll continue to monitor as Richard said over the long-term. I think the other thing to consider as how this migrates to the wholesale side of equation in the business. And that\u2019s also something we\u2019re very aware of. ","Richard K. Davis","Yeah that\u2019s right. So think about this is P2P right. Then there is P2B, people are paying their bills and there is a B2P where people are trying to business are reaching out to you and giving you reason to buy things and send money back. And then there is B2B which we\u2019re all working on including block chain. And then we\u2019re working on all of those alternative most of those are so nascent. I think as a banking category those are just all upside for us, because there is so much opportunity and much less to see remediation.","But you\u2019re on to something, Bill and there will be a time. Right now babysitters you go home and you pay him cash, you write them check. Now you\u2019re going to start doing it in real time between you and the 17 year old and the money moves. We\u2019re assuming remediating something that\u2019s right now not a debit or credit card. But overtime this is something we have to put the whole universe together and figure it out. And I\u2019ve said this before I\u2019ll say it again the banks as a collaborative are working better together than we ever have to make sure we work together and create a better circumstance for all of our clients. And I think that\u2019s a big plus in the last couple of years if we see payments emerge as a real time issue. ","Bill Carcache","That\u2019s great color. Thanks gentlemen. ","Richard K. Davis","Thanks. ","Operator","Your next question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin Barker","Thank you very much. Good morning. In regards to your commentary around the Brexit and your real positive commentary around that. Could you dig in a little bit on the impact of the Brexit in regards to your payments business in particular?","Richard K. Davis","Yeah that\u2019s generally where it\u2019s going to be. Because we\u2019ve got the merchant acquiring activity, which we\u2019ve talked about a little bit here before. So I think we\u2019ll make -- we'll call it neutral for now based on what you can Kevin just because we have such a UK influence. I think there is a positive in UK enter UK and there is probably side negative enter Continental Europe. But we\u2019re going to say that to be net to favorably positive on the payment side. ","Terry you got the trust side, you got a lot of employees in the Brexit impact there, you might talk about that. ","Terrance R. Dolan","Yeah in our corporate trust business which is that we have in Europe at least recently we\u2019ve seen just a little bit of a tick down with respect to deals that are being done as people kind of pause during that timeframe. But the impact that it had on the long rate of a curve so the tenure actually is probably going to stimulate the deal flow in terms of debt issuances. So the overall net impact of that over the next quarter or two, I would actually anticipate would probably be positive. ","Richard K. Davis","Yeah deals aren\u2019t getting allowed they\u2019re just being come in the new ones... ","Terrance R. Dolan","In Europe they\u2019re be in deferred, but in the United States the yield curve impact is actually stimulating some growth.","Richard K. Davis","Is that helpful Kevin?","Kevin Barker","Yeah that\u2019s very helpful. And then in regards to your marketing spend and professional services spend obviously that can be volatile quarter-to-quarter depending on the business conditions and what your planning for the future. But given the uptick you\u2019re seeing there, would you expect that to decline over the next few quarters just because of the spend we saw in the second quarter?","Richard K. Davis","Yeah good question. In my 54% range of efficiency we\u2019re holding steady to finish what we start at this year on our marketing and branding campaign because there is a value and stability and sustainability in messaging. As you know people have to do things seven times to remember them once. So we\u2019re not going to give up on that and then the cost of third-party assistance on compliance as I said starts to tick down slowly.","So those are both sustainable for the rest of this year. But trust me everything we can control continues to be in our gun sights. And marketing is one of those things that if it has to go it has to go, but I\u2019d love very much to not cut it off just a bit too soon if in fact we\u2019re on the advent of some times here what we can afford to do what we want to do and grow the company greatly. ","Kevin Barker","Thank you for taking my questions. ","Richard K. Davis","Yeah, thanks. ","Operator","Your next question is from Nancy Bush with NAB Research. ","Richard K. Davis","Good morning, Nancy. ","Nancy Bush","Good morning, Richard, how are you?","Richard K. Davis","How are you?","Nancy A. Bush","Good. Thank you. I have a question that sort of encompasses a number of these interest rate questions that have been asked before. If you look at the JPMorgan Chase results yesterday, there is nothing in those results that says recession. If you look at your results, there is nothing that says recession. I\u2019m about to go onto Wells Fargo call. I assume there is nothing there that says recession. But the talk is about recession. And when you listen to Janet Yellen speak, it\u2019s about global softness. And I mean, there is just a massive disconnect now between what we\u2019re seeing at the micro-level in the banks, and what the experts are talking about at the macro level. Can you help me reconcile this before I bang my head into the wall?","A - RichardK. Davis","Yeah. Well, first of all, I\u2019m going to join you more than because I agree with you. But I will tell you, we are what we see. And I\u2019m going to say two things that Fed is it has a different lens on this. They are looking at different things and looking usually later than we are. But on a real time basis, which we live in everyday, we are seeing a slow recovery. And it\u2019s a small nuance on a word, but a recession as things are going backwards where people are starting to feel worse and not taking actions that they might otherwise have taken before. We are not seeing that.","On the other hand, because we\u2019re balance sheet companies and because we're highly levered and because half of what we do is in the wholesale business, we\u2019re all, I think, spending a lot of energy talking about how we\u2019re waiting for the wholesale side of the balance sheet to pick up in a real organic, old-fashioned way, and we\u2019re also not seeing that. But they\u2019re not going backwards, so just taking this long, long, long period of time to restructure, evaluate their best options when things do pick up.","And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, but that\u2019s why we have all these unused commitments and continue to grow the balance sheet. About the business side, they\u2019ve got reasons and they\u2019re informed and they\u2019re waiting. But on the consumer side, it\u2019s a little bit better every quarter and it\u2019s not a recession. And I would disagree it if someone is saying that at Fed level. And in fact, I think you can see consumers are starting to spend again. They\u2019re savings is at a level that they are comfortable. They\u2019re using their credit cards and they\u2019re paying it back on time and getting rewards for it. But I would say it actually make sense to me. But for the words recession being standard about lately by a lot of parties, we don't see it.","Nancy A. Bush","Okay. Secondly, I had a question related to the consent order. You mentioned that it prevents you from doing branch acquisitions. Basically, branch institutions. Does it also prevent you from opening any new loan production offices? Is that something you're thinking about? And which markets do you -- are there any markets that you need to be in that you're not in right now?","Richard K. Davis","Good question. The answer is no. It doesn\u2019t impair our ability to open loan production markets. And the answer is we don\u2019t have any new markets to get into, but I\u2019ve never had the chance to show you guys just how many markets we are in out of our footprint. So 25 state footprint where you see us on the street and you drive by us every day. And the other 25 states, for the most part, for commercial real estate, corporate trusts, middle market and large corporate, we\u2019re in all of those states. We just really have never taken the time to show you that.","So I\u2019ll make this a note to do that at the Investor Day in September 15th to make sure we show you where all of our loan production offices are outside of what would be the footprint. Because when I show you, you\u2019ll see wherever we want to be, and so the answer to the expansion is no, because we\u2019re already there.","Nancy A. Bush","Okay, thank you.","RichardK. Davis","Yes, thanks.","Operator","Your final question comes from Terry McEvoy with Stephens.","RichardK. Davis","Hey, Terry.","Terence McEvoy","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Trust and investment management fees, looked to be up 6% or 7% if I just based off the trailing four quarter average. In the release, you talked about account growth. Could you give a little bit more color about that business in 2Q as well as maybe the outlook for the back half of the year?","Andrew J. Cecere","Yes. So if you ended up looking at the second quarter or if you look at the first half, the first quarter was a little bit slower simply because of the market spend. But in the second quarter where the market starting to recover, we\u2019re starting to see nice growth again with respect to new accounts, both on the corporate institutional side as well as within wealth management itself. So we end up looking into the second half of the year. We would anticipate that that sort of growth would continue just given the rebound, for example, in the markets where they are at today.","Terence McEvoy","And then just a quick question for Kathy. Could you run through your mortgage banking outlook for Q3? And then just so I am cleared, does that include your best guess on hedging, gains losses and MSR changes in fair value?","Kathy Rogers","Yes. So for mortgage fees, we are anticipating that that will have a linked quarter increase of about 20% to 30%. That does include all of our assumptions around hedging and so forth, so that\u2019s all in. And as Andy indicated earlier, I do think that we\u2019re going to see a little bit of a shift between -- in our application base from purchase -- between the purchase and refi. As he indicated, we\u2019re kind of 65-35 this quarter. I think that that\u2019s likely to go more towards the 60% purchase, 40% refi as we move forward.","Terence McEvoy","Perfect. Thanks so much.","Richard K. Davis","Thanks, Terry.","Operator","I will now turn the call over for closing remarks.","Kathy Rogers","Thank you for listening to the view of our second quarter 2016 results. Please contact us if you have any follow-up questions.","Richard K. Davis","Thanks, everybody.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Andy Cecere, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon Eastern Time through Wednesday, January 28 at midnight Eastern Time. I will now turn the conference call over to Sean O'Connor, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.","Sean O'Connor","Thank you, Paula, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere, Bill Parker and Kathy Rogers are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's fourth quarter and full year 2014 results and answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our Web-site at usbank.com.","I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Richard.","Richard K. Davis","Thank you, Sean. Good morning everybody and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin with a few highlights from U.S. Bank's 2014 full year results on Page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bank reported record net income of $5.9 billion for the full year of 2014 or $3.08 per diluted common share. We achieved industry leading profitability with the return on average assets of 1.54%, a return on average common equity of 14.7% and an efficiency ratio of 53.2%. Total average loans grew by 6.3% and average deposits grew a strong 6.5% year-over-year.","Credit quality continued to improve with an 8.9% decline in net charge offs and 11.2% decrease in non-performing assets. Our capital position ended the year stronger with a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated for the Basel III standardized approach as fully implemented of 9%. In total, we returned $4 billion or 72% of our 2014 earnings to the shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.","Turning to Slide 4 and our quarterly highlights, U.S. Bank reported net income of $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2014 or $0.79 per diluted common share. Total average loans grew by 5.9% year-over-year and 1% linked-quarter. In addition, we continued to experience strong loan growth, strong growth in average deposits.","Credit quality remained strong. Total net charge-offs decreased by 8.3% from the prior quarter while total non-performing assets declined 6% on a linked-quarter basis. We continued to generate significant capital this quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated for the Basel III standardized approach as fully implemented was 9% at December 31. We repurchased 11 million shares of common stock during the fourth quarter which along with our dividend resulted in a 66% return of earnings to our shareholders in the fourth quarter.","Slide 5 provides you with a five-quarter history of our performance metrics, and they continue to be among the best in the industry. Return on average assets in the fourth quarter was 1.5% and return on average common equity was 14.4%. Moving over to the graph on the right, you can see that this quarter's net interest margin was 3.14%, and Andy will discuss the margin in more detail in just a few minutes.","Our efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 54.3%, lower than the prior year. Excluding the impact of notable items in the fourth quarter, our efficiency ratio was 53.8%. We expect this ratio will remain in the low 50s going forward as we continue to manage expenses in relation to revenue trends while continuing to invest in and grow our businesses.","Turning to Slide 6, the Company reported total net revenue in the fourth quarter of $5.2 billion, a 5.7% increase from the prior year. Excluding the impact of this quarter's gain related to an equity investment in Nuveen, total net revenue increased 3.2% from the prior year. The increase was due to higher net interest income as well as higher revenue in most fee businesses.","Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 7. Average total loans outstanding increased by almost $14 billion or 5.9% year-over-year and 1% linked quarter. Adjusting for the Charter One acquisition, total average loans grew 5.5% year-over-year. Overall and excluding covered loans, which is a run-up portfolio, average total loans grew by 7.1% year-over-year and 1.2% linked-quarter.","Again this quarter the increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans, which grew by 15.5% year-over-year and 2.9% over the prior quarter. Total average commercial real estate loans also grew increasing 4.2% year-over-year and 0.3% linked-quarter. Residential real estate loans grew 2.2% year-over-year and were relatively flat on a linked-quarter basis. Average credit card loans increased 3.6% year-over-year and were up 1.3% on a linked-quarter basis. Total other retail loans grew by 3.6% year-over-year and 0.8% over the prior quarter, mainly driven by steady growth in auto loans.","We continue to originate and renew loans and lines for our customers. New originations excluding mortgage production plus new and renewed commitments totaled approximately $53 billion in the fourth quarter. Total average revolving commercial and commercial real estate commitments continued to grow at a fast pace, increasing year-over-year by 13.3% and 3% on a linked-quarter basis. Line utilization was relatively flat in the fourth quarter.","Total average deposits increased almost $19 billion or 7.2% over the same quarter of last year and 1.6% over the previous quarter. Excluding the Charter One acquisition, the growth rate remained strong at 5.5% on a year-over-year basis. Growth in low-cost interest checking, money market and savings deposits was particularly strong on a year-over-year basis.","Turning to Slide 8 and credit quality, total net charge-offs declined 8.3% on a linked-quarter basis and 1.3% on a year-over-year basis. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 0.50% in the fourth quarter. Nonperforming assets decreased by 6% on a linked-quarter basis and 11.2% from the fourth quarter of 2013. The loss sharing agreement for the commercial and commercial real estate loans acquired from the FDIC, which comprised the majority of the nonperforming covered assets, expired at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014.","During the fourth quarter, we released $20 million of reserves, $5 million less than the third quarter of 2014 and $15 million less than the fourth quarter of last year. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect the net charge-offs and total nonperforming assets to remain relatively stable in the first quarter of 2015.","Andy will now give you a few more details about our fourth quarter results.","Andrew Cecere","Thanks, Richard. Slide 9 gives you a view of our fourth quarter 2014 results versus comparable time periods. Our diluted EPS of $0.79 was 3.9% higher than the fourth quarter of 2013 and 1.3% higher than the prior quarter. The key drivers of the Company's fourth quarter earnings are summarized on Slide 10.","Fourth quarter results reflected notable items that in combined increased diluted earnings per common share by $0.01. The notable items included $124 million gain related to an equity investment in Nuveen Investments and $88 million of additional expense comprised of $35 million of charitable contributions and $53 million related to recent developments in certain legal matters.","The $32 million or 2.2% increase in net income year-over-year was principally due to an increase in total net revenue, driven by increases in net interest income, fee-based revenue and the impact of notable items. The Company also achieved positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. Net interest income was up 2.4% year-over-year, as an increase in average earning assets was partially offset by lower net interest margin including lower loan fees.","The $35 billion increase in average earning assets year-over-year included growth in average total loans as well as planned increases in the securities portfolio. The net interest margin of 3.14% was 26 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to growth in the investment portfolio at lower average rates, lower loan fees and lower rates of new loans, partially offset by lower funding costs. Lower loan fees were due to the previously communicated wind-down of Checking Account Advance, our short-term, small-dollar deposit advanced product.","Noninterest income increased $214 million or 9.9% year-over-year due to higher revenue in most fee businesses and higher other income including the impact of the Nuveen gain. We saw growth in retail and corporate payments, merchant processing, trust and investment management fees, deposit service charges, treasury management fees and investment product fees.","Noninterest expense increased year-over-year by $122 million or 4.5%, primarily due to the accruals for legal matters, charitable contributions and an increase in compensation expense reflecting the impact of merit increases, acquisitions and higher staffing for risk and compliance activities. Net income was higher on a linked-quarter basis by $17 million or 1.2%, mainly due to the higher net interest income, the impact of the notable items and a decrease in the provision for credit losses.","On a linked-quarter basis, net interest income increased 1.9%, mainly due to an increase in average earning assets, partially offset by lower loan and investment security rates. The net interest margin of 3.14% was 2 basis points lower than the third quarter, principally due to the growth in lower rate investment securities, partially offset by unusually high interest recoveries. These unusually high interest recoveries added approximately 2 basis points to the fourth quarter net interest margin.","On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income was higher by $128 million or 5.7%. This favorable variance was primarily due to higher other income including the impact of the Nuveen gain, partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue and seasonally lower corporate payments revenue.","On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense increased by $119 million or 7.3% due to seasonally higher cost related to investments and tax advantage projects, higher professional services and the notable items including the charitable contributions and legal accruals.","Turning to Slide 11, our capital position is strong. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented at December 31 was 9.0%. At 9.0%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to $15.96 at December 31, representing a 10.8% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 1.9% increase over the prior quarter. Our return on tangible common equity was 20% for the fourth quarter. Also, we are complying with fully implemented U.S. liquidity coverage ratio based on our interpretation of the final rolls.","I'll now turn the call back to Richard.","Richard K. Davis","Thank you, Andy. I'm very proud of our 2014 results. We reported record net income, maintained our industry-leading performance measures and returned 72% of our earnings to shareholders. These results are directly tied to the hard work and dedication of our employees. In fact last week I had the privilege of leading our 9th Annual All Employee Meeting. There was a pleasure to once again make this annual connection with our employees and to thank them for their contributions and for our success.","I'd also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Andy and Kathy. Yesterday we announced that Andy has been promoted to the Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer where he will be responsible for our core lines of business. Andy has demonstrated tremendous leadership as CFO and we are confident in his ability to manage our businesses effectively and execute our customer-focused growth strategy.","Kathy Rogers, currently EVP responsible for Business Line Planning & Reporting including the stress test process, will replace Andy as Vice Chairman and CFO. Kathy has been with U.S. Bank for 28 years and has served in a variety of leadership roles within the finance organization. Many of you have already met Kathy and I know she looks forward to meeting the rest of you very soon.","So as we head into 2015, we remain focused on extending our exceptional track record or financial performance for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our communities and our shareholders. That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill, Kathy and I would now be happy to answer questions from the audience.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets.","Jon Arfstrom","Just on the topic of the promotion, I think we're all big Andy supporters, we appreciate the new role for him, but can you maybe share what drove the change and is there anything you are trying to signal or anything that changes with the way the Company is going to be run, and anything change in your role, Richard?","Richard K. Davis","My role doesn't change but it is a chance for Andy to demonstrate the same acumen he's had in the financial role by running the revenue business lines, and as we move through this transition I think as the economy starts to get better, I'm quite excited to have him keenly focused on what leverage we can create as the economy picks up. I'll continue to be running the whole Company but focus especially on the support teams and the compliance and the operating integrity that's gotten this Company to this point so far. And it is fairly transparent, it's a chance to give Andy an opportunity to prove that he can run virtually all parts of the Company in the eventual opportunity for him to run it someday.","Jon Arfstrom","Good, thank you. And then just a question on 2015 in terms of some of your targets, historically you've had this 4% to 6% loan growth target and I think it kind of changes from quarter to quarter your level of optimism, but are you feeling optimistic and do you feel is that the right range, 4% to 6%, and what does it take to get to the higher end of that?","Richard K. Davis","Yes, Jon, actually I'm optimistic. So we've been sitting in that 1% to 1.5% linked-quarter for a while and this quarter you see we were at the lower end of that, but for the year you look back and we are just short of 6% year-over-year loan growth, and we're just projecting a higher number for 2015, slightly higher, in the high 6, low 7. So if we are accurate, and we usually are, then we see that as a small but steady continued improvement in loan growth.","Let me take you back to 10 years ago, for those who remember though, we are not going to be dissuaded by people who want to compare us to those who are growing loans faster in a given quarter because we never have been impacted by that, but I could remember 10 years ago being questioned on a call like this for why our loan growth isn't as fast as someone else's, and we're just not managing to that point. We're managing to high-quality loan portfolio. I think our quality of charge-offs and nonperforming assets will prove that.","And so, tempting as it might be to tell you guys we're going to move to 1.5% to 2% linked quarter or 8% to 10% year-over-year, the economy doesn't warrant that yet and we're going to continue to take market share on the pricing benefits and the quality benefits we've been using for the last five to seven years, and as the economy slowly improves so will our loan growth but not remarkably, and therefore in a few years you'll be satisfied that we have remarkably high credit quality and a continued stability on what we promised through the entire cycle. So, I think we're optimistic for all the right reasons but at a small incremental level from perhaps 1% higher year-over-year than we did in '13.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay. Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","When we met back in November, we talked a little bit about outlook for investing in the business and some of the things you were asking the business unit heads to do, and I guess I'm just wondering if the game plan to grow the business with kind of current headcount is still in place, basically wondering if you're thinking about expanding at this stage to capture more market share or to do the same, to grow the market share with the same\u2026?","Richard K. Davis","Got it. I'll repeat it in a different way. What we said was 2014 was the year that we'll continue to keep an eye on any discretionary expenses that would otherwise not be as important given the fact that expenses were going to be challenged and the fact that the economy was slow. 2015, I think like a lot of our peers, we've adopted the Fed's interest-rate scenario which starts to move up in the middle of the year. If that happens, that's awesome. But if it doesn't, we're not entirely related. It's not going to make or break this Company on whether interest rates move up. We're going to control a lot of other things.","So the first half of '15, given Fed's interest-rate scenario, it will a lot like all of '14 where we'll continue to invest where we have to, we'll watch the discretionary investments and keep them perhaps, defer them a bit until we can see a stronger economy, we'll add the compliance, operating risk areas, audit areas where we think we continue to need to make sure we're at the right level of support, and then when interest rates hit, we're ready to pop and move on to some of these more discretionary investments.","What's really good about it though is we'll continue to grow market share, we'll continue to do well even though there's really no underlying reason for it but the fact that the employees are just better. They work harder, they find more opportunities in each relationship, our employee engagement is at record levels which I think informs employees that are engaged are intensely [indiscernible] where they can do more with whatever assets they are given and they'll continue to do it if they believe the Company's future is strong and that they are part of it.","So I'm quite comfortable that in the next six months we can keep doing what we've been doing. If rates move up then we are all glad and we're going to move right on to start adding back, but if they don't this Company still controls a lot of levers and we're not completely relying on whether rates move up and we'll just manage it one month at a time like we do every year and look forward to talking to you when things are better.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, so if rates don't go up, there is still the hold the line to the line on headcount expenses?","Richard K. Davis","Yes, except for the areas where it's either necessary or the opportunity is too great to pass. There are plenty of things where you can get an ROI in the same calendar year with an investment. I'm taking all those I can. But some of those ROIs are three-year paybacks, four-year paybacks, they're great ideas but they're not necessarily the best investment at a time when you're trying to be prudent against an otherwise difficult backdrop. So we'll hold those off for a while longer. We have so far and it hasn't hurt us permanently and I don't think it will for another six months, even 12 if we had to.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, so you can flex if the rate environment changes from the said outlook is the takeaway?","Richard K. Davis","You got it.","Betsy Graseck","And then just the follow-up is on the auto leasing business, we had some information over the last couple of weeks that [indiscernible] was going in house. I'm wondering how that impacts you.","Richard K. Davis","Not much. I mean the headlines are sometimes just that. For us the leasing business is part of our very big indirect auto lending and this is leasing, and for us it's probably 10%, maybe 15% of our leasing business, which is a small fraction of our total lending business. So it's not material in every sense of the word literally and figuratively and we do leasing with virtually every other party as well. So this wasn't a core fundamental pillar of our success in auto leasing. So we're not worried that we can't replace it pretty shortly.","Operator","Your next question comes from John McDonald of Bernstein.","John McDonald","Richard, I was wondering your kind of high-level thoughts on how you are viewing the revenue to expense relationship unfolding in 2015 given what you laid out for Betsy in terms of your rate outlook, how do you see revenues and expenses kind of in your base case this year and what are the key wildcards?","Richard K. Davis","So, John, if you look back on 2014, we grew revenue just a little bit over 1%. This is kind of normalizing for all the noise we had, and expenses were up just a little more than 1%, slightly negative operating leverage. So shame on us, we're disappointed, but it's the way it rolled out.","If interest rates move up in the middle of the year consistent with the Fed's recommendation, we will see revenue in the 3% to 4% kind of range and expenses more in the 2% to 3% kind of range. If they don't, then we're going to have to struggle to get really close to positive operating leverage just like we did for '14, and to dwell on Betsy's question, we know exactly how to do that without killing the future, but it will be a lot less enjoyable. We'll have to continue to get it through until we see interest rates giving us the benefit of higher revenue.","I just want to say, we are positive, we're extra positive of interest rates growing but based on our trust and payments business particularly, more than most banks, when interest rates move up, for us it's because the proxy of the economy getting better that then triggers all kinds of benefits on our income statement, a lot more than just the spread in the margin.","So we kind of see the way we're positioned, we're kind of attuned for interest rates increasing because it's the fundamental reason that the increase is going to benefit some of our fee businesses. But we're going to be positive, we're shooting for positive operating leverage at higher levels of both operating revenue and operating expenses, but to follow Betsy's question and time together, if something less positive occurs we're able to adjust to it and we've got a team that knows how to manage that, they've proven it and we're not going to disappoint you guys.","John McDonald","Great. And just a nuance on the rates up scenario and your base case, if the Fed does act in the second half of the year, but we still see long rates low because of global issues, how does that impact the outlook for revenue growth and is that an incremental challenge, and Andy, how do you manage through the balance sheet with long rate so low and does that create pressure on your base case scenario if the 10-year stays low like this?","Andrew Cecere","The short answer, John, is no. The long rate is less impactful to us. We're most impactful at the very short end and if you think about the middle then two to three years is where we have a lot of impact. We don't have a lot of assets in our book that are at the 10 year and beyond mark, so that's less impactful. Again the short end is the most impactful to us, both in net interest income as well as fee income because of the way we're using our money funds.","John McDonald","Okay. And then just a quick follow up, Andy, what's your outlook for the net interest margin in the first quarter?","Andrew Cecere","Sure, John. So if you think about this quarter, third quarter we were 3.16%, this quarter we were 3.14% and frankly it was a little bit better than we expected and what we told you it was going to be. And the reason for that, part of the reason for that is we have usually high interest recoveries this quarter, and I talked about that in my prepared remarks, and that helped margin by about 2 basis points. I would expect that to dissipate going into the first quarter.","So you think about our core being at 3.12%, I would expect us to be down a few basis points in the first quarter from that 3.12% for the same reasons we've talked about, which is the loan mix, principally wholesale versus retail, and then the last tail of our securities build. So we sort of had first average part of it in the fourth quarter, we'll pick up the rest of it in the first quarter. And we are done. We ended the quarter at $100 billion, we're over the 100% LCR ratio. So we're done with it but we'll still have a little bit of a lingering impact, so down a few from 3.12% in the first quarter.","John McDonald","Okay, something like 3% to 5% or 2% to 4%, just something in that range?","Andrew Cecere","Yes.","John McDonald","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Carache of Nomura Securities.","Bill Carache","So given your loan growth expectations and the NIM commentary that you just provided, can you talk about your ability to grow NII under the different rate environments that you've been discussing?","Andrew Cecere","We will grow NII on a year-over-year basis, both the combination of what Richard talked about and what I talked about on rates. So our expectation is net interest income will grow. Now in the first quarter, if you think about it on a linked quarter basis, the first quarter has two fewer days and that costs us just under $40 million. So absent that, we'll be slightly, relatively stable but the first quarter is a little down because of days.","Bill Carache","Okay, thank you. I had another question on your payments business. On the issuing side, you guys reported a solid acceleration in payment volume growth this quarter. Can you give us a sense of the interplay between pressure on purchase volume growth from lower gas prices on one hand and increased spending power that the consumer enjoys on the other, does the acceleration that you saw this quarter suggest that the latter dominates the former or is it too early to tell and the acceleration is a function of something else, maybe some color around that?","Richard K. Davis","I think the answer is, yes, lots of questions, but latter does it from the former. So here's the deal. We've got this really great opportunity with our corporate payments, not just our retail issuing, to see that and government, we can see pretty much where everything is moving around and we can see directly and very quickly the movement in the, let's say first on the corporate side where corporate T&E is still outpacing, and we're still growing that even with the softness of the fuel prices, so we're still seeing T&E grow which is a pretty good sign that businesses are transferring some of that into other expenses.","Consumers are the same. So anything related to energy or gas prices has been coming down but the ticket prices and the number of visits people have made to restaurants, hotels and some of those discretionary things that they would spend money on had absolutely gone up. So, Bill, we've seen at least in 90 days almost a perfect correlation from people still spending the money they're saving on gas through their debit, credit or prepaid cards but they are spending on things that I'm sure that a lot of retailers and the restaurateurs are happy about. So we see that evidence both at the consumer and at the corporate level.","Bill Carache","That's really helpful. On the acquiring side, you guys also had nice growth but interestingly that reflected a little bit of deceleration, which is kind of an interesting contrast to the acceleration that we were just talking about on the issuing side. Can you talk about maybe what's driving that?","Andrew Cecere","On the merchant acquiring side, part of that is seasonality. So our fourth quarter is typically lower than our third quarter and that goes to mix of business a little bit. If you think about the issuing side, we have a lot of retail. On the acquiring side, we have less retail, more airlines and the like. And you think about when people buy tickets and so forth, this is less so in the fourth quarter. So it's more seasonal, still we're showing good growth year-over-year, same-store sales is just under 5%.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. I'm showing he disconnected. Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI.","John Pancari","Another question on the margin. Beyond the first quarter, want to get your thoughts on the margin progression. Is it fair to assume 2 to 3 bps of quarterly compression mainly on competitive pressures on loan yield, just want to get your thoughts there?","Andrew Cecere","So I would describe it as 2 to 3 basis points given flat rates more because of loan mix than competitive pressure, although pressure is a little bit of it, but it's more the mix. Most of our growth is coming on the wholesale side of the equation and the wholesale has about half the yield of retail. So that's what's driving that 2 to 3 basis points more than anything, and again that assumes the rates flat to current levels. Once and if and when rates start to move, we'll start to see a positive rise there.","John Pancari","Okay, alright. And then separately on the expense items, just on comp expense and the increase in fourth quarter, was that all performance related, just want to get an idea of what the driver was?","Andrew Cecere","In the fourth quarter we have normal activities going on in increases related to risk and compliance positions for the most part, [indiscernible] headcount and [indiscernible] increases. We had some increases in compensation expense related to incentives. But if you peel those two things out, it was relatively stable.","Richard K. Davis","And John, it was a full effect of our RPS acquisition in Chicago that had a full quarterly effect in quarter four as well, but there was nothing unusual and it doesn't bode for any significant change in quarter one.","John Pancari","Okay, alright. And then lastly just want to ask on credit. You released additional reserves this quarter and wanted to just get your thoughts on where the reserve to loan ratio could bottom out, I mean you're still at a healthy level here, they're around 167 basis points or so.","Richard K. Davis","Bill?","P.W. Parker","Yes, it's 177 on allowance to loans, all-in allowance. I mean it's really a function of our mix. That's why ours look a little bit higher than some of our peers, so we have a higher percentage of credit cards. So obviously we're comfortable with where it's at. You see we have very, very modest reserve release. I think when that inflects, really gets to the point of what kind of loan and commitment growth we see during the coming year. There is a little bit more room for opportunity in some of the residential and home-equity products but at this point it's going to be more a function of loan and commitment growth going forward.","Andrew Cecere","I mean the stability, [indiscernible].","P.W. Parker","Yes, the stability of our credit portfolio right now is the strongest I've ever seen. It's just extremely all the loaners are performing well.","Richard K. Davis","And there surely will be an inflection point for all the banking, right, where eventually you have to reserve for loans that you're making and [the future may go bad but] [ph] we're not looking at that inflection point in the near term for our Company, we're simply not, and we haven't been driving much income off of reserve releases, so we don't have much to gather again from that, but eventually we'll end up reserving for as opposed to releasing but we are not there, now we're not there for a little while.","John Pancari","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom of Guggenheim.","Eric Wasserstrom","I just wanted to follow-up on some of the commentary on fee income growth. I think for the prior year the security gains were about 4% of the noninterest income. So as we think ahead to next year, is the realization of those gains going to be something that continues as kind of a bridge to a better rate environment or were those really just opportunistic and we should really think about growth off of a baseline number of something like 8.8 billion?","Andrew Cecere","The latter. So I think the notable items, the gains that we talked about, the Visa gain in the second quarter, the gain from Nuveen here in the fourth quarter are one-time items that are not likely to repeat, so [exempt] [ph] from that base that is excluding that think about loan growth in there.","Eric Wasserstrom","Okay. So I think absent those things, the growth rate was about 1% in terms of fee income and it looks like the consensus for next year has about implied 5% growth off of that core number. Is that an achievable level given kind of some of the acceleration that we've talked about or is that maybe a stretch?","Andrew Cecere","I think a key factor in '14 was the headwind that we faced in the first half of the year related to the mortgage and if you looked at the mortgage numbers they were down 13%, 14% year-over-year which caused a tremendous headwind in quarters one, two and a little bit in three and you're seeing quarter four we're actually flat for the first time in a long time in mortgage. So I think the removal of that headwind will help us get to the numbers that are higher than we achieved this year.","Richard K. Davis","That's a big deal. We should have had the applause because that is a long anticipated moment where we're starting to grow mortgage again on a year-over-year basis. That is a big number, Eric, so if you do the math, you'll see that it's more than enough to accomplish that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Bove of Rafferty Capital.","Richard Bove","I got to ask as I think 30,000 feet high for a second, when I look at your bank, I can see absolutely nothing wrong. In my view it's about as perfect as a company can get in this industry. And yet when I take a look at Slide 9, I see that on a year-over-year basis the net interest income to common is up 0.6%, I see that the EPS is up 2.7%, and when I take a look at the price of your stock it's up 2.6% last year in a market that's up 11%, and what I'm wondering is, if a bank which is as close to perfection as this one is, can't get its earnings to move up at a faster rate and can't get its stock price to do anything but move up at a rate one quarter that of the market, what will it take to get this thing moving in a direction where the stock is going to equal or outperform the market?","Richard K. Davis","This is Richard. Thanks for that observation. I think U.S. Bank moves best when everything is moving one way or another. So the bank was 10 years ago a fairly considerate bank with a sense of all defense, right, we were an efficiency company, no one ever thought about us making revenue, which is save the next dollar, we can merge and acquire companies and squeeze more out of that than anyone else, and that was well-regarded and well-recognized.","Then the downturn hits, and that was our first chance to prove, like I said earlier in an answer to John's question, that while we may not look like we are growing as much in the go-go times, we also chose not to take risks and those showed up later when the economy turned and we ended up getting stronger. I know you know this, you've written about this, we became a flight to quality, a place of safety and we played on that.","So now here we are in kind of a flat, slow, slow recovery that's almost flat, so we can't prove anything remarkable except to just say we're not going to disappoint, we're not going to surprise, we're not going to get complicated, we're just going to get it out and do a little bit better than everyone else on all the basic tenants.","The next opportunity for us to perform is when the rates pick up because the markets picked up and to show that the Bank is repositioned now to be as strong as it ever was when it was on defense and be better than anyone else on offense. So I'm going to hold your question in the rears until we get the chance to show you that when the recovery starts and because of our high credit quality, our amazing pricing benefits that we have based on our debt ratings, that we are going to be able to show you we can be even better.","And then I think the multiple comes back, we even spread further from where we are because we're always sitting at this high multiple that people need us to be, remarkable every quarter to prove and protect, but we are looking forward greatly at the time when the world gets better and we can show you just how positioned we are for that, and there's a lot we did in that period of time, in the last five to seven years, to position this Company as innovative, payments focused, trust leader and global.","So I'll look forward to that and I'll ask you to ask me the question again when things start to turn, but I think it makes sense that we hold our own position of strength, kind of the yellow flag is out on the racetrack but when the green flag comes out we'll take off first.","Richard Bove","Again, I have no questions with [indiscernible], I think the way you run the Bank is superb. My issue I guess is, and we heard it again last night in the State of the Union message, will the government prevent the industry from reaching a level where it can show meaningful profit increases or will it come up with a new liquidity capital ratio supplement to leverage ratios, loss absorbing capital ratios and special [indiscernible] for taking high levels of risk? In other words, as you improve your Company, will the government stay one step ahead of you and prevent you from showing the type of improvement that you're getting in the operation of the Company?","Richard K. Davis","I'll tell you I can't answer that because I don't know the answer, but I will say that we're in a closed set of competitors, right, at least as banks go, and we certainly wouldn't trade places with anybody else based on our current position, our size, the fact that we're a domestic city not a global city, the fact that we don't do leverage lending, we don't have high-risk portfolios, and all I'm saying there is, customers, businesses, they're all going to need banks and unless there's a huge alternative I haven't found out there, they're going to need what they need.","[It worries me not] [ph] what the government does to impair our profitability, we will be there first amongst few I think at the highest returns and the highest quality to be there to receive those needs from the customers and almost despite \u2013 because I mean look, I mean, Dick, we lost $1.5 billion in the last four years over four or five specific government decisions on how to [indiscernible] income and we still had a record year.","So we can do this. It's a lot harder, it's a lot less satisfying and it's a lot less predictable, but I think we've figured out how to do this and what we do is control what you can, be very nimble and ready to adjust to the next opportunity, and I for one can't imagine a scenario that would be any more difficult than what we have now, so I'm looking forward to getting a little bit easier with a little more clarity. But I agree, it's complicated and I can't answer directly to your question because it's what I contemplate at 30,000 feet every day.","Operator","Your next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Bryan Batory","This is Bryan Batory from Ken's team. Apologies for the mix-up earlier. I was wondering if you could provide a little color just on the starting point for noninterest expenses in the first quarter '15, just particularly thinking about the reset in other expenses, and then also the potential pension expense increase just given where your long-term rates ended 2014?","Andrew Cecere","This is Andy. If you think about the fourth quarter, there are two unusual items in total. The first is the total of the notables which is $88 million. The second is our higher CDC or the tax advantage amortization which happens every fourth quarter. That was about $60 million. So if you take out that $150 million or so, I would expect us to be relatively flat to that in the first quarter. Secondly with regards to pension expense, year-over-year we'll see about $100 million increase in pension, of $25 million a quarter, and that is reflected in the numbers I gave you in the first part.","Bryan Batory","Okay, great. And then could you provide some color on your outlook for mortgage banking revenues as we head into '15 just given the recent decline in interest rates?","Andrew Cecere","Good question, and it's changing every day as rates move a lot. We had a very good week last week. But right now I will tell you that our expectation is relatively stable total revenue fourth quarter into first quarter. So we have some pluses and minuses and that could change as rates move around in the next few weeks and we'll update you if it does, but right now relatively stable.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Mayo of CLSA.","Mike Mayo","In terms of your outlook for loan growth, so you're expecting an acceleration you said from 6% closer to 7% range and also your growth in commitments was up 3%, so that's good. On the other hand, you mentioned that the unused lines of your commitments are still bouncing along the bottom I guess unchanged. So once again we're at another quarter where you're expecting better growth yet the 10 year yield is significantly lower. So who's going to win, Richard Davis or the 10 year bond?","Richard K. Davis","[Indiscernible] 10 year yield, Mike, [indiscernible] I've been buying them and everything. I mean actually you're playing into one of our thoughts. I haven't included the improvement in utilization at all in our expectation if loan growth goes up. That is an absolute stable starting point. And the way we look at it, wholesale commitments, a lot of banks look at the total retail, we look at wholesale, and that number is at highest point in the mid-30s and today it's sitting at 24%. It's been stuck there for about 18 months. And so to me that is unbelievable upside.","As long as we keep adding commitments more than loans, that means that more people have an open to buy with us and that they have an intent to use it, because they're paying for it and so are we by the way, but if they use it, any part of it, even a slightest movement from 24% to 28% or 30%, that's going to be on top of the kind of loan growth we're anticipating. So we're not counting on that to give you the answer, and I do think that while customers look at the 10-year, as Andy said most of them look more at the two to three and that movement is going to be what's going to trigger the decision on whether they want to grab something before it gets too late and whether they'll be glad they prepared themselves with the line of credit that's got an open to buy. That has a lot to do.","I think there will be a tsunami effect when there is a period where people are sure that rates are moving up, I think they'll start grabbing the lines they have, they'll start using what they have and they'll be incentivized, be a catalyst for this economy, but until then we're not counting on that as part of our expectations to provide loan growth, we're just doing with our better debt ratings, our better pricing power and our really remarkable employees who've learnt how to tell our story better.","Mike Mayo","So just more generally, put your economist hat on, Richard, so the 10-year seeing this much slower growth yet your guidance is for some acceleration in your loan growth. How should we reconcile those two thoughts?","Richard K. Davis","On one hand and on the other hand, [indiscernible] harness. Mike, I don't think those are directly correlated right now, and I say that because the Fed and the Fed equivalent across the globe, they've done some behaviors that are certainly not [indiscernible] and they are not things that we all learned in school. To the extent that they are being motivated by I think non-financial, more political activities and more financial data that might be backwards looking not forward-looking, I'm not going to be able to correlate those two for you, and I don't think our customers are sitting there thinking that way either.","So the 10-year stays low, sure mortgage will look great and then we go back to this again, but it doesn't inform our customers that the majority of this Bank until we get to two to three and until that starts to bend up, we're going to stay right where we are and if the 10-year informs us, fine, if it doesn't, it's probably going to be a bit of an inflection on the curve, but I'm not managing to the 10, I'm in management of the two or three, and I'm just not that smart.","Mike Mayo","And then lastly, you're implying market share gains. You said before that U.S. Bancorp has a 30 to 35 basis point pricing advantage when pricing commercial loans against some of the largest banks. Now that the SISI premium might go even higher for some of the larger banks, could that pricing advantage improve and how are you positioning your Company to potentially benefit?","Richard K. Davis","The answer is, yes, because you know the math, you knew the answer when you asked it, and where we're positioned is we have a philosophy that we will give back some portion of that advantage when we're competing against one of the banks that has a different pricing scheme and we'll only do it with the high quality customer. I suppose, because the philosophy is in place, if that spread were to widen, then we give ourselves more room to be more competitive, but it doesn't interest a new philosophy, it's just more of a larger scale for us to use and to give our lending offer the opportunity to price more effectively. So it's a net positive, I'm not counting on it, but if it happens we'll take it gladly and we'll be even more successful.","Mike Mayo","How much higher could that go with 30 to 35 basis points today, could it go up another 5, 10, 20, 30?","Andrew Cecere","The capital differential is about equivalent. So if you think about your 35 on the side from the perspective of our debt rating, it's an equivalent level on the side about the capital differential from the highest levels.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Miller of FBR.","Jessica Ribner","This is Jessica Ribner for Paul. On the mortgage side, what are you guys seeing in terms of the purchase market? As most of your volume coming off the refi side, do you see any recovery there?","Andrew Cecere","The third quarter was 70-30 new, and because the rate is coming down a bit, it's closer to 60-40, 62-38. So it's coming down a little bit more high on the refinancing side and we are also starting the year strong that way because of the low rate environment. So I would expect it to be somewhere between that 60% and 70% new.","Jessica Ribner","Okay, great. And just in general, what's your institutional view on housing and the recovery, do you think that we have room to go or where do you see mortgage banking?","Richard K. Davis","We do, but more than just mortgage, first mortgage, right. So we're already seeing it now on our home equity, we're growing nicely in home equity. Thanks for asking, Richard. Yes, we're actually growing almost three times the market with our home equity right now and we're doing that because we're seeing a lot of people invest in property improvement kind of monies into their homes and not doing debt consolidation, entirely they're doing it for their properties, and these are in some of the states where they are the hardest hit, where the pricings have come, [indiscernible] come back nicely.","So mortgage in general has got a really nice I think outlook because people without houses now feel that they are no longer under water and they're willing to invest in them, people without houses that are now above water are willing to use it as collateral for something else, I think small business, and housing prices slowly but surely are recovering.","I think there is a social question we ought to ask ourselves is how many 18 year olds who five years ago their mother or father lost their job or their house are going to want a house in the American Dream category three years from now when they're 25. Don't know that answer but I know that the housing stock is not at all overbuilt for the number of people who either need to get back out of their parents' basements or get an upgrade in the house that they live in and we think it's a good business for us, we're staying in it, we want to be in the top five from here to forever and we're investing accordingly to make sure that we're great at originating loans and servicing them as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nancy Bush of NAB Research.","Nancy Bush","Congratulations, Andy, well deserved. Richard, there was a debate sort of brewing out in the wake of fourth quarter earnings which I think have not been particularly wonderful particularly for the largest banks about whether the industry can continue to cut costs without 'going from cutting fat to cutting muscle', and I'd like to get your view on that, and secondly just from the perspective of your Company, I think you go through this exercise every month of where you are in terms of expenses, how do you make sure that you're not cutting muscle? I'd just like to get what you guys do and what you see for the industry generally.","Richard K. Davis","A great question, as usual. Here are a couple of thoughts. I do think \u2013 let's talk about the efficiency ratio, it's what everybody looks at, it's a fraction, right, it's a quotient. So one of the reasons I think we can do well is because our revenue grows. I mean there is a very basic fact, like you all know, that if you grow revenues faster than expenses, your efficiency ratio comes down. That's a fact.","Banks are usually two parts revenue to one part expense. So it's important if I were to spend $100 million, my team has got to get $200 million in revenue just to keep it to 50% efficiency ratio. So those are some of the foundational points. So number one, if you grow revenue, you can impact your efficiency ratio and still grow expenses because it's not like it's [Pioneer] [ph] where you can't grow expenses, and we've been able to do that but not at the levels we want.","I do think the argument at the largest bank level is partly due to revenue. I think banks could do better with their revenue but to the extent that that gets slightly impaired by certain actions, they've got to watch their expenses. And honestly I don't know why are banks in the 60% efficiency. It doesn't make sense to me because if you watch every dollar, there's plenty of money that is not necessarily shareholder friendly that's been spent and you can put a discipline in place where the employees own it first before you're telling them what to do.","So in other words we've never brought in an outside party to look at our Company and tell us how to run it or tell us how to cut expenses, where you impose on employees some oversight if they didn't do themselves, because number one, it's intrusive, number two it's really unnerving because if I have to cut 10 people out of a room of a 100, the rest 90 don't know if they're safe or they're in the next group to fall.","So I think that is another reason for us to be thoughtful, is that banks need to watch their expenses very, very carefully, and I'm now going to answer out the other side of my mouth that in the last five years it didn't caused banks to be amazingly disciplined in knowing where their money is being spent. I haven't got an answer for why as I thought there would be a ton of banks in the low 50s with this at this point in time. I actually don't know why there isn't.","As it relates to U.S. Bank, we do meet every single month, every capital expenditure at U.S. Bank, get ready for this, over $100,000 has to come through a committee and that's a capital expenditure that includes particularly properties, leases or any kind of technology improvement. That's a very low number. We look at about a dozen items every month and the whole team is the managing committee. And so if somebody in commercial real estate needs a special new program that's going to cost them $100 million, I got to look at the rest of 13 people and say, are you willing to add $200 million in revenue over the next three years to offset this, and guess what, when the vote is taken by the group, sometimes it's no. But we all know that we've got to be able to return our investments in a fairly short time.","So in closing, if we could do an ROI in everything in less than one year, it gets approved here every minute. If it takes two years, it gets contemplated given the circumstances. If it's finally more than three years, we're very, very careful and thoughtful about it. So I know that we are not improving every single thing that lead to revenue improving three to four years from now, I know we're not. I also know we're improving everything that has the highest value in the next couple of years and the minute the world gets better, I've got a list from most important to least important that will go right back into the coffers, we will improve them immediately and the shelf is full of the next best ideas so that we don't linger and lose any time to get back to spending money.","So I didn't answer your question very well but it's the discipline, knowing what you're doing, put in the hands of the employees where they control their fate, give them a forecast to show them what the decision is going to mean so they can make that decision on their own or collectively as leaders and they'll always make the right one and then they don't feel like they're being told how to run the place and they feel like you respect them for the qualities of their leadership, that we do. So that's my long answer to your question.","Nancy Bush","So I guess I interpret that as you're saying, yes, there is still lots of fat in the banking industry that can be cut?","Richard K. Davis","Yes, I am saying that. Why didn't I just say that? Why do I talk so much, Nancy, what's wrong with me? Yes, that's what I meant.","Nancy Bush","Okay. Secondly if I'm reading the news correctly, the Supreme Court just refused to hear a case about swipe fees. Am I reading that correctly?","Richard K. Davis","That's right.","Nancy Bush","And does that mean that this issue will now go away or do you think that the retailers are going to come back with some other new slant on this?","Richard K. Davis","I think in terms of a lifecycle, it goes away for all of us on this phone. It could go back, come back in a few years and has another 10 to 15 year lifecycle, but in this half-generation, I think by all accounts, exclamation point, this one is dead.","Nancy Bush","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session of today's call. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks.","Sean O'Connor","Thank you for listening to our call this morning and please contact me this afternoon if you have any follow-up questions.

Andy Cecere, Terry Dolan, and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s fourth quarter results and to answer your questions. Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks.

We have a lot to talk about this morning, and as usual we\u2019ll take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. I\u2019ll start with Slide 3.","In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.97, which included several notable items amounting to $0.09 per share. Let me take a minute to talk about these notable items.","The tax reform legislation that was passed a few weeks ago is a very positive development that will provide immediate and ongoing benefit to our employees, customers, communities and our shareholders as we invest a portion of our tax savings in each of these important constituencies. As a result of the signing of the legislation, the company recognized a one-time fourth quarter benefit related to the revaluation of our tax-related assets and liabilities of $910 million. In connection with this event, we took the opportunity to make $150 million contribution to our charitable foundation and we accrued $67 million for a special one-time bonus to certain eligible employees. The impact of these two items was approximately $152 million net of tax.","We also recognized an accrual of $608 million for costs associated with legal and regulatory matters and an investigation discussed in previous filings related to our legacy bank secrecy, anti-money laundering compliance program, and a legacy banking relationship between U.S. Bank and a former customer\u2019s business. U.S. Bank has worked diligently over the past several years to improve and strengthen its AML controls, processes and staff, including increasing compliance staff and making significant investments in systems.","U.S. Bank embraces the highest standards of integrity, risk management and compliance, and we remain committed to continually improving our controls and processes across the enterprise to protect all of our stakeholders. The 8-K we filed this morning provides additional information on this topic.","Our earnings per share were $0.88, excluding the notable items. Slide 4 provides highlights of our results. Loan growth was in line with our expectation at 0.8%, credit quality was stable, and our book value increased by 6.9% from a year earlier. We returned 72% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.","Slide 5 highlights key performance metrics. Our performance, excluding notable items, in the fourth quarter was highlighted by a 13.4% return on average common equity, a 17% return on tangible common equity, and a 1.33% return on average assets. We delivered positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter and our efficiency ratio, excluding notable items, was 55.3%.","Now let me turn the call over to Terry to provide more detail on the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance.","Terrance Dolan","Thanks Andy, and good morning. If you turn to Slide 6, I\u2019ll start with a balance sheet review and follow up with a discussion of fourth quarter earnings trends. My remarks will be referencing results excluding the notable items.","In the fourth quarter, average loans increased by 0.8% on a linked quarter basis and grew 2.6% from a year ago. Commercial loans increased 1.0% sequentially. We continued to gain market share across our commercial lending businesses. Commitment levels increased in the fourth quarter; however; line utilization rates continue at historical low levels and pay down activity remained elevated in the quarter as some borrowers tapped capital markets to fund long-term funding needs. Pay downs also continued to negatively impact our commercial real estate portfolio. We remain prudent in our lending activity in both our construction and commercial mortgage lines, continuing to forego loan opportunities that do not fit our return and risk appetite.","Primarily as a result of the pay down activity and our prudent view in lending in commercial real estate in general at this time, average total commercial real estate loans declined by 1.5% in the fourth quarter, which contributed to a 40 basis point drag to our total average loan growth for the quarter. Retail loan growth of 1.9% was supported by strong growth in installment loans and retail leasing. During the quarter, credit card loans increased 1.4% sequentially, partly reflecting seasonality, and mortgage loans increased 1.0%.","Turning to Slide 7, average total deposits increased 1.2% on a linked quarter basis and 3.0% year-over-year. Compared with the third quarter, non-interest bearing deposits increased slightly and saving deposits grew 1.4%, reflecting growth in consumer and business banking and wealth management and investment services. Our interest-bearing deposit betas continue to perform consistently with past experience. We expect the total interest bearing deposit beta following the most recent rate hike will end up between about 30 to 35%. As future rate hikes occur, we continue to expect our deposit beta will gradually trend toward a 50% level; however, the pace toward that level continues to be somewhat slower than we initially anticipated primarily due to lower than expected betas in our consumer deposits.","On Slide 8, you can see that credit quality was relatively stable compared to the third quarter. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans declined one basis point on both a linked quarter basis and year-over-year. Non-performing assets declined by 4.0% on a linked quarter basis and were 25% lower than a year ago.","I will now move onto earnings results. Slide 9 provides highlights of fourth quarter results versus comparable periods. Record fourth quarter net revenue of $5.6 billion was up 0.5% compared with the third quarter and up 3.7% versus the fourth quarter of 2016. On Slide 10, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter, up modestly compared with the third quarter and up 6.4% year over year. Linked quarter and year-over-year growth were both supported by growth in loans and higher loan yields.","In the fourth quarter, the net interest margin decreased two basis points to 3.08% as expected. Excluding interest recoveries that contributed approximately two basis points to the third quarter margin, the net interest margin would have been unchanged. Slide 11 highlights trends in non-interest income, which increased by 0.8% on a linked quarter basis and 0.4% year-over-year.","On a year-over-year basis, corporate payments systems revenue grew 10.5% and credit and debit card revenue grew 5.4%, both driven by higher sales volumes. Trust and investment management fees increased 7.1% mainly due to favorable market conditions and net asset and account growth. Somewhat offsetting this strong fee performance was a 15.8% decrease in mortgage banking revenue driven by lower refinancing activity which impacted production margins for the industry, as well as slightly lower merchant revenue. In line with our previous guidance, merchant processing revenue declined 1% from a year earlier mainly due to the exiting of certain joint ventures in the second quarter of 2017 and the impact of weather events that occurred late in the third quarter of 2017.","Turning to Slide 12, non-interest expense increased 2.5% compared with the third quarter of 2017. The increase in expenses was primarily due to seasonally higher costs related to investments in tax advantaged projects. On a year-over-year basis, expenses grew by 3.6%, reflecting higher compensation and employee benefits expense mainly related to hiring to support business growth and compliance programs. Regulatory and compliance expense growth has slowed in recent quarters and continues to moderate towards the company\u2019s overall expense rate. It\u2019s worth noting that in the fourth quarter, professional services expense decreased 27% versus a year ago, reflecting fewer consulting services as compliance programs near maturity.","Slide 13 highlights our capital position. At December 31, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented was 9.1%. This compares to our capital target of 8.5%.","I\u2019ll now provide some forward-looking guidance. Let me start with a discussion of how our earnings will be positively impacted by tax reform on a go-forward basis.","Our effective rate in 2018 is expected to be approximately 16% for federal tax purposes plus 3 to 4% for state taxes, or approximately 9% in total. We expect our taxable equivalent to tax rates to decline to about 21.5%. This compares with our taxable equivalent tax rate, excluding notable items, of about 29.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Consistent with our capital management policies, we plan to reinvest approximately 25% of the tax benefit we expect to realize in business growth initiatives, including technology, innovation and business automation, as well as in our employees. Inclusive of these accelerated investments, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the full year of 2018.","Now let me shift to first quarter 2018 guidance. We expect net interest income to increase at a mid-single digit pace on a year-over-year basis. Due to the impact of day count, we expect net interest income to be modestly lower on a linked quarter basis as is typically the case in the first quarter. We expect fee income to increase at a low single digit pace on a year-over-year basis. On a linked quarter basis, fee income is typically lower in the first quarter due to seasonally lower credit card and merchant processing sales volumes and seasonally lower deposit service charges. We expect expense growth on a year-over-year basis to be in the mid-single digit range. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense is typically seasonally higher in the first quarter due to higher compensation costs reflecting the timing of merit increases, employee benefits, employee incentive programs, and marketing activities. This is somewhat offset by seasonally lower tax credit amortization and professional service costs. We expect non-interest expense to increase slightly on a linked quarter basis. We expect credit quality to remain relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter.","I\u2019ll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.","Andrew Cecere","Thanks Terry. We are now 10 years past what, in hindsight, was the beginning of a national crisis. By almost any account, the banking industry has re-emerged stronger, safer, and more nimble. Today the economy appears to be on firm footing. The regulatory environment is becoming more supportive of growth and tax reform will arguable promote job growth, consumer spending, and prolong the growth base of this business cycle.","Against this backdrop, U.S. Bank is well positioned to win market share in our lending and fee businesses and deliver improving returns on equity while operating with the same risk discipline that has served us well through many credit environments. The delivery of predictable, industry-leading profitability and returns has been a constant over the years, but recently the pace of improvement in these metrics has been limited by headwinds we have faced, some within our control, some out of our control. However, there is reason to believe that these headwinds are starting to abate.","First, expenses have been higher than we considered normalized primarily due to costs related to addressing our consent order with the OCC. However, the heavy lifting is completed and we expect compliance and regulatory costs to continue to revert towards our overall expense growth trajectory.","Fee headwinds are starting to shift in our favor. Mortgage refinance activity, which has been a headwind for the industry, is declining at a diminishing pace, and home sales continue to strengthen. Strategic decisions and market challenges depressed our merchant processing in revenue in 2017; however, we remain confident that merchant processing revenue will return to a mid-single digit growth trajectory by the third quarter.","While diminishing headwinds are beneficial, what we are most optimistic about is the potential for investments that we have previously made in our businesses, as well as investments we plan to make in the future, to increasingly manifest in the form of improving top line revenue growth and profitability. Our corporate payments services business is firing on all cylinders heading into 2018. For the first time in many years, both the commercial business sector, which is benefiting from higher T&E spend, and the government sector are showing good momentum. In our wealth management and investment services businesses, market share gains are being driven by new client growth. In our traditional banking businesses, we are up-tiering our clients in corporate bank and moving up the lead tables in our capital markets businesses.","On the consumer side, investments over the past several years aimed at enhancing our auto relationships are driving strong market share growth. We are well positioned as one of the few remaining non-captive lessors in the industry and as one of the few financers to offer both a lending and leasing option to our dealers.","It is clear that past investment spending is delivering the intended results, and we expect to reap those benefits for years to come. Now, because of tax reform, we have the opportunity to accelerate our investment spending. We will target additional technology and innovation spending on the initiatives aimed at enhancing the customer experience and leveraging our competitive positioning, with a particular focus on payments, digital and mobile banking, and B2B capabilities. Technology and innovation are core to our long-term strategy for growth, and we\u2019re excited about the opportunity to advance key initiatives that will support both top line revenue and improved operating efficiencies.","To wrap up, I believe that 2018 will prove to be a very good year for U.S. Bank, and by that I mean for the entirety of what makes us U.S. Bank - our employees, our customers, our communities, and of course our shareholders.","That concludes our formal remarks. Terry, Bill and I will now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Your first question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Amanda Larsen","Hi, it\u2019s Amanda Larsen on for Ken.","Andrew Cecere","Hi Amanda.","Amanda Larsen","Did you all say that your effective tax rate is going to be 19%? Can you go over that again?","Terrance Dolan","Yes, it was 19%.","Amanda Larsen","Okay, great. Then the expense outlook, you noted that you\u2019re planning on reinvesting approximately 25% of the benefit, and you noted that there would be an expense growth rate in 1Q18 of mid single digits. Should we expect that for the full year \u201918, we\u2019re going to move to the mid-single digit range in lieu of that 3 to 5% you guys had previously discussed?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. When we end up looking at expenses for the full year of 2018, because of the reinvestment that we plan on making, you would expect us to be in that mid-single digits and the high end of that range.","Amanda Larsen","Okay, thanks. Then also, can you touch upon the growth outlook for \u201918, particularly in deposit service charges area and treasury management? A couple of your competitors have announced some changes - overdraft, making more customer friendly, and then on treasury management, just if you are moving that earnings credit rate yet. Thank you.","Terrance Dolan","Yes, and thanks for the question. From a fee standpoint, so if you think about deposit service charges, we made a lot of those types of changes a while back, and so I wouldn\u2019t see us making any further changes with respect to our fee structure at this particular point in time. We have seen good growth with respect to deposit service charges, and that is really tied to both deposit balance and just growth in terms of consumer accounts.","In terms of treasury management, treasury management has been a real success story for us this year. We\u2019ve seen good core growth in terms of client relationships throughout the year, and we would continue to expect that that will have a positive impact going into 2018. As deposit rates do rise, though, we would expect that we would be making some adjustment to the earnings credit rate, and that would dampen it a bit.","Andrew Cecere","I\u2019d add, Terry, as we think about treasury management, we think about it in combination with corporate payments because they\u2019re really two parts of the same component, and corporate payments in particular has had a wonderful year - 11% growth, both on the government as well as the corporate side. Our virtual pay product is growing 22%, and as we think about the future, there\u2019s going to be that combination of thinking about treasury management together with corporate payments.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","John Pancari ","Good morning.","Andrew Cecere","Morning.","John Pancari","On the merchant processing side, Andy, I know you indicated that you\u2019re confident you can get back to that mid-single digit growth rate by third quarter. What are you seeing that\u2019s giving you that confidence in the rebound?","Andrew Cecere","I\u2019ll ask Terry to add on, but I think the principle reason is two of the impacts this year and this quarter were weather related as well as the exit of the joint ventures that we\u2019ve talked about in the past. The weather related will diminish greatly in the first quarter and going forward, and we lap the exit of the joint ventures starting in the second half of \u201918.","Terrance Dolan","Yes, so the impact of those two is about 2.5 to 3%, and again the weather events diminish pretty significantly in the first quarter and then by the end of the second quarter, as Andy said. The other thing we\u2019re seeing is that sales volumes in our merchant acquiring business have been particularly strong. We\u2019re 4%-plus in terms of same store sales, which was good - we saw some nice lift in the fourth quarter, and then our overall sales were about 7.3%, kind of in that ballpark, and that\u2019s because we\u2019re seeing nice growth in terms of new business. We believe that that momentum that we started to create in the merchant acquiring business is going to help us generate that mid single digits by the end of the--by the second half of 2018.","John Pancari","Okay. All right, that\u2019s good. Then on the loan growth side, just wanted to get a little bit more color in terms of what you\u2019re thinking about for 2018. Is it fair to assume still around GDP, GDP plus, so 2 to 3% growth in loans as you look at \u201918; and on that front, on commercial real estate, just want to get your updated thoughts on when we could see some stabilization and possibly some growth in that line. Thanks.","Terrance Dolan","Yes, so let me take it first and then I\u2019ll hand it off to Bill. If you think about loan growth, in the near term there is certainly going to be impacts of tax performance. It\u2019s a little bit difficult to forecast, but quite honestly loan growth in the near term is going to be dependent upon the level of pay downs that we see and that sort of activity in the capital markets as corporate customers realign or rebalance their debt structure, the capital structure if you will.","I think your expectation of GDP, kind of in that range or a little plus of that is a good or reasonable estimate as you think about the full year, but in the near term it\u2019s going to be impacted by some of the things that we see in terms of customer behavior.","Bill Parker","I\u2019ll pick up on your question on commercial real estate. The commercial mortgage line, which has seen decreases for the last several quarters, I think that\u2019s a function of the interest rate environment. Once we get through this rate increase environment, see more stabilization there, I think we\u2019ll be more able to build that book. On the construction side, we are seeing some positive growth on our residential construction area. We\u2019ve been expanding that into the southeast and we\u2019re hopeful with the tax bill that perhaps multi-family should come back, so we\u2019re looking forward to being aggressive in that area in \u201918.","Terrance Dolan","Then John, maybe the last thing I would just add in terms of loan growth is that in the latter half of 2017, and I think with tax reform, we are seeing momentum in terms of consumer spend and consumer activity, and I think that that bodes well with respect to loan growth on the retail side.","John Pancari","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open.","Scott Siefers","Morning guys.","Andrew Cecere","Morning Scott.","Scott Siefers","A quick question just on the mid-single digit expense growth for \u201918. Just so I\u2019m clear, can you give maybe the dollar amount off which--for 2017 off which you\u2019re basing the mid-single digit growth expectation?","Terrance Dolan","Yes, I think if you end up looking at our growth rate this year, it was a little bit above 5% on a year-over-year basis, and we expected that to continue to improve excluding the tax reform and some of the reinvestment that we end up making. With that tax reform, that really is kind of what causes us to think we\u2019re going to be at the high end of that range, or in the mid-single digits.","Andrew Cecere","I think, Terry, when we\u2019re talking about the base for that, it is off of the numbers excluding notable items, which I think is about $12.1 billion of expense.","Terrance Dolan","Yes, yes.","Scott Siefers","Okay, perfect. Yes, that clarifies it. I appreciate it. Then I think you guys said in the prepared remarks that you would expect positive operating leverage excluding the investments. I guess that implies revenue growth somewhere at or below the mid-single digits?","Terrance Dolan","No Scott, we expect positive operating leverage including the investments - including the investments.","Scott Siefers","Oh, including - okay. All right, good. I appreciate that clarification. Just wanted to make sure I heard it correctly, and I did not, so. That\u2019s it for me, so I appreciate it.","Terrance Dolan","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Kevin Barker","Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to get a little bit more detail on the innovation spending that you\u2019re making, and when you think about the range of mid-single digit growth rates, can you put some parameters around that?","Andrew Cecere","Our focus is going to be on the things I talked about, which is digital, mobile banking, B2B, brand, continuing our expansion of our customer base and our customer experience, and as well as our employees, and we talked about the increased $15 minimum wage. But those are all the things we\u2019re talking about, and as you think about what we\u2019ve been doing, our success is really dependent on continuing to innovate and continuing to deliver the very best customer experience, so those are the things we\u2019re focused on that, over time, will continue to drive the growth that we\u2019ve been experiencing.","Then Terry, in that mid-single digits, we\u2019re talking around 5% or so in terms of expenses, right?","Terrance Dolan","Yes, that\u2019s right.","Kevin Barker","Okay, and then in regards to the flow through into 2019, 2020, will you start to return back to your longer term target 3 to 5% expense growth rate, or do you feel like that will continue for the next couple years?","Terrance Dolan","Yes Kevin, maybe let me take that. If you think about incremental investments that you\u2019re making, there\u2019s kind of an arc, and I think about it over kind of a two or three-year time frame, making the investments today and you start to see the revenue benefit in that second half of the second year and then into the third year. So when we think about 2019 and 2020, we have to kind of think about that arc, if you will. I do believe that as you get down to the 2020 time horizon, you\u2019re going to see that incremental revenue that\u2019s going to be impacting the business positively, but the double benefit of that is that with the digital initiatives that we have going on, we also would expect to see efficiencies come from those investments as well, following that sort of time horizon.","Andrew Cecere","And importantly, Terry, as you said, we\u2019re looking at this from both a revenue and an expense perspective, and we\u2019re making the additional investments to grow the revenue, and to simply say that we\u2019re going to manage both sides of that equation, the positive operating leverage in \u201918,\u201919, \u201920 and going forward.","Kevin Barker","Okay, thanks for taking my questions.","Terrance Dolan","Thanks Kevin.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Ricky ","Hi, this is actually Ricky from Matt\u2019s team. Sorry if I missed this, but I\u2019m wondering if you could touch a bit on NIM outlook for the year, both with and without additional hikes, and the puts and takes there.","Terrance Dolan","Yes, given all the moving parts, Ricky, I think one of the things we\u2019re going to focus really on is giving guidance with respect to net interest income, so when we think about net interest income going into next year, we would expect growth pretty similar to what we see this year, fee income growth being a little bit stronger. That net interest income growth is going to be driven by our expectations around loan growth and just the rising rate environment.","Ricky","Got it, and then maybe one follow-up. It looks like securities ticked up a bit this quarter. Wondering if you could talk a bit about that and what the trajectory for the securities book should look like in 2018. Is that going to track overall balance sheet growth, or what\u2019s the thinking there?","Terrance Dolan","Yes, the way that we end up managing our investment portfolio is really from a liquidity management standpoint, and that will track very consistently with the growth in average earning assets.","Ricky","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Erika Najarian","Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions.","Terrance Dolan","Hey Erika.","Andrew Cecere","Morning.","Erika Najarian","Good morning. My first question is just on the regulatory backdrop. It seems like there is bipartisan momentum to pass some amendments to Dodd-Frank, and obviously the Senate version has a dollar threshold of $250 billion. I\u2019m wondering if you could sort of share some feedback - does that simply mean if the new threshold for SIFI is $250 billion that nothing changes for U.S. Bank, or does that put you in a different tier in terms of SIFI rules?","Andrew Cecere","My expectation, Erika, is that we would see limited changes to the U.S. Bank. As a reminder, we\u2019re above $250 billion but we don\u2019t have a SIFI buffer on the capital component. We\u2019re already at the capital levels. We have the processes in place for CCAR and stress testing, so I expect limited change or impact to our company.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Just as a follow up to Ricky\u2019s question, could you share embedded in your positive operating leverage guidance how many rate hikes you presume for 2018, and also the shape of the curve for 2018?","Terrance Dolan","Yes, so when we\u2019re thinking about 2018, we expect that we\u2019re going to see rate hikes, probably a couple rate hikes, and then one in December, so we\u2019ll see two kind of midyear, and then in terms of the yield curve, we kind of established our plan or our forecast based upon where the yield curve was in that mid-December time frame, and as you know, recently it\u2019s steepened a little bit but I think there\u2019s probably going to be movement up and down in terms of where that yield curve is. There\u2019s going to be pressure, and I think it\u2019s probably going to flatten a bit as rates rise during the year as well.","Erika Najarian","Got it, thank you.","Andrew Cecere","Thanks Erika.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Long with Raymond James. Your line is open.","David Long","Morning everyone.","Terrance Dolan","Hey David.","David Long","Just wanted to get your thoughts on any potential competing away of any of the tax benefits, whether that happens in 2018 or further on down the road.","Terrance Dolan","Yes, so this is Terry. When you think about tax reform, I think how it ends up getting utilized, we talked about the reinvestment; but the competition in terms of pricing, we obviously live in a pretty dynamic environment. I do think that there is going to be some bleed that will take place because of competitive pricing, but I also expect that that\u2019s going to take place over time and it\u2019s probably going to be a little bit different, depending upon the product and the service and the customer segment that you have. Obviously, we operate in a pretty competitive environment, so ultimately how much gets competed away will be dependent upon that competition.","I would say that if you think about the last 10 years, though, the industry has run at lower return levels because it\u2019s been real difficult to price in things like regulatory costs and the cost of capital and liquidity, and all sorts of things. So I do think that especially for some period of time, the banking industry is going to try to recapture some of that in terms of its returns, and as a result from a competitive standpoint I think that will be a little bit delayed.","David Long","Got it, appreciate the color. Thanks.","Operator","Again if you would like to ask a question, press star, one on your telephone keypad. Your next question comes from Brian Klock with KBW. Your line is open.","Brian Klock","Good morning everyone.","Terrance Dolan","Hi Brian.","Brian Klock","I have a question, I guess probably for Bill. Talking about the CRE pay downs, I noticed that there was a tick-up in charge-offs after being in a net recovery position in the CRE book for a while. Can you talk about that? I think the note was related to enclosed malls that were written down, so can you give us a little bit of color on that?","Bill Parker","Sure. Well, obviously at this point in the cycle, you eventually run out of the recovery, so we\u2019re pretty much there on the CRE book. On the enclosed malls, we do have a smaller portfolio of what I\u2019d call small market enclosed malls, and I think some of those were more harder hit with this shift to online, so that\u2019s where we saw that. The overall portfolio is about $700 million, but we don\u2019t expect that to continue each quarter. We just had a couple of deals this quarter that we had to deal with.","Brian Klock","All right, great. Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. A follow-up question for Andy, I guess - thinking about the legal settlement or the legal accrual that you had in the quarter related to BSA AML, and I know you guys have spent a lot of money and a lot of effort to remediate that, can you give us an update on where you stand, or where you think you stand with that regulatory order?","Andrew Cecere","Yes, that hasn\u2019t changed, Brian. We completed most of the--all of the systems integration and process and build, as well as the people and process at the end of 2017, and we\u2019re now on a sustainability phase of it and we will continue to be in there for the first half of \u201918, which is really ensuring that the processes we\u2019ve put in place are acting and performing as expected.","Brian Klock","Okay, so it\u2019s possible maybe back half of \u201918, you could be looking or being able to pursue bank acquisitions again? Is that reasonable, or is this something we should think about for \u201919?","Andrew Cecere","You know, that\u2019s dependent upon the regulator, certainly, but we are doing everything on our end to make sure we\u2019re performing as well as we can. As I said, I think we have all the processes and systems and people in place, now it\u2019s just a matter of going through it and ensuring that they\u2019re working appropriately.","I would also remind you that the M&A activity that we\u2019ve been focused on has been not related to the AML consent order of things, like card portfolios, payments, and trust activities. We\u2019ll continue to look at those items.","Brian Klock","Right. Helpful, and thanks for your time.","Andrew Cecere","Thank you, Brian.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters.","Jennifer Thompson","Thank you everyone for listening to our call.

Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, President and Chief Executive Officer and Terry Dolan, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon, Eastern Daylight Time, through Wednesday, April 26 at midnight Eastern Daylight Time.","I will now turn the conference call over to Jen Thompson, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.","Jen Thompson","Thank you, Melissa and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Andy Cecere, Terry Dolan and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s first quarter results and to answer your questions. Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.","I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today\u2019s presentation in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Andy.","Andy Cecere","Thank you, Jen. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call. I am going to start off by giving you some high level commentary, Terry will then provide more detail in the first quarter results and some forward-looking guidance, and after that, we\u2019ll take your questions.","In the first quarter, we reported net income of $1.5 billion or $0.82 per diluted share. Slide 3 of our presentation provides a summary on the quarter. As is typical in the first quarter, seasonal factors impacted sequential results. However, on a year-over-year basis, we reported solid growth in revenues, earnings, loans and deposits.","Turning to Slide 4. I would like you to focus your attention on profitability and returns. In the first quarter, our return on average assets was 1.35%, our return on common equity was 13.3%, and our efficiency ratio was 55.6%. We are proud of these industry leading results and we continue to focus on enhancing our performance. We expect our return to shareholders and our efficiency ratio to improve throughout the year as we gain market share in core business lines and benefit from the funding advantage afforded by our high debt ratings and superior deposit franchise. We expect to do this while maintaining the same expense and credit risk discipline our shareholders have come to expect from us.","The U.S. economy continues to improve. Interest rates are finally in an upward trajectory and consumer sentiment reflects optimism for potential actions by the new administration. So, there is a lot of change and potential opportunity on the macro front, much of which could be to the benefit of the banking industry. I believe we are well positioned for this next phase of the cycle. During the first quarter of 2017, commercial loan growth was sluggish across the industry. Our large corporate customers tell us that they are optimistic about the future, but are awaiting more clarity regarding potential changes in tax and regulatory reform, infrastructure spend and trade policies. Additionally, some of our clients are actively accessing the capital markets, which pulls some financing from the bank lending arena or result in reduced line utilization. However, we expect commercial loan growth to be better in the second quarter versus the first and we expect more robust commercial loan growth in the second half of the year.","Let me talk more about profitability and returns. We are not interested in growing just to get bigger. We are focused on profitable growth. And that mindset is deeply ingrained in our culture. As a result, we are willing to forego volume growth to maintain an appropriate level of profitability. We have been doing this for years in our company. In the wholesale bank, we often acquired new customers by allowing them to utilize their balance sheet for some amount of time, but if we can transition that into a more profitable relationship, we call the relationship. That strategy has translated into client growth, higher revenue per client and better profitability. We apply this same logic in our payments business and every business line for that matter. High volume, low margin business can impair profits. So as an example, we are purposely allowing less profitable business in [indiscernible] to runoff. In the near-term, that\u2019s a headwind to top line merchant acquiring services sales and revenue growth, but those clients are being replaced by more profitable relationships. And that transition is setting us up well for the future. Terry will give more detail on merchant processing revenue during his remarks.","Turning to expenses. Our efficiency ratio remains best-in-class, but it\u2019s higher than we would like it to be. As we said last quarter, we expect expense growth to moderate as certain risk management programs are fully implemented later this year. We are committed to delivering positive operating leverage for the full year 2017 with the support of top line revenue growth, careful management of expense and reduced cost pressures from compliance programs. And we will deliver that positive operating leverage without pulling back on prudent investment spending. We remain diligent on the topic of risk management. We feel very good about our credit quality and the overall credit environment. Our net charge-off ratio continues to be stable and the non-performing asset ratio improved on both the linked quarter and year-over-year basis in the first quarter. But we will never take our eye off the ball or fool ourselves into thinking we will be able to predict when the churn in the business cycle will come.","Finally, our capital position remains solid. We haven\u2019t been burdened by an excessive amount of capital that has weighed on the returns. That said we have sufficient capital to support growth, effectively manage through periods of economic stress and continue to return capital to our shareholders. Our tangible book value per share of $19.13 at March 31 was up 6.6% versus a year ago.","With that, let me turn it over to Terry to provide details on the quarter.","Terry Dolan","Thank you, Andy. I will start with a balance sheet review and then discuss first quarter earnings trends. Slide 5 shows our loan growth trends. Average total loans outstanding increased 0.2% on a linked quarter basis and grew 4.1% compared to the first quarter of 2016. Strong linked quarter growth in retail leasing and residential mortgages was essentially offset by modest declines in commercial loans, commercial real estate loans and home equity lending. As mentioned earlier, the commercial loan growth was sluggish across the industry during the first quarter. Our commercial loans declined slightly compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the seasonal decline of corporate card balances, which are included in our commercial loans, our commercial loan growth was positive 0.2%. Somewhat offsetting this headwind in the first quarter was strong growth in middle-market lending across many geographies. Loan growth in commercial real estate reflects our own prudent approach in lending to certain CRE segments, such as multifamily and retail given current market conditions.","Turning to Slide 6. Total average deposits declined 0.2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting typical seasonal trends and lower funding requirements given the slower loan growth in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, average deposits increased 11.0%. Following the March interest rate hike, our total interest bearing deposit beta is about 20%. As future rate hikes occur, we model that the beta will gradually trend toward a 50% level.","On Slide 7, you can see the credit quality remained relatively stable in the first quarter. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans were 50 basis points in the first quarter, up slightly by 3 basis points compared to the fourth quarter and 2 basis points higher than a year ago. Non-performing assets declined by 6.7% compared with the fourth quarter, and NPAs as a percentage of loans plus other real estate decreased 4 basis points to 55 basis points at March 31. Improvement was driven by commercial loans, commercial real estate, residential mortgages and other real estate.","Slide 8 represents some information on two areas that have received a lot of attention lately by the investment community: auto lending and retail industry exposure. First, on auto, we are a prime lender in the space and we do not originate sub-prime auto loans. The average FICO score for originations in 2016 was over 770. Our credit metrics remain very stable in auto lending. The second area is the retail industry segment, given recent pressure, as consumers alter their buying habits. Commitments related to the retail industry totaled 3.4% at year end 2016. A little over half of that is direct C&I exposure to retailers, two-thirds of which are to investment grade or equivalent clients. We have minimal exposure to retailers who make their malls. We are watching this retail segment and are comfortable with our portfolio, given the relative small exposure, geographic diversity and high quality of customers.","I will now move on to earnings results. Slide 9 provides highlights of first quarter results versus comparable periods. First quarter net income of $1.5 billion was essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter, but was up 6.3% versus the first quarter of 2016. The first quarter is impacted seasonally each year and this quarter was no different. Turning to Slide 10, total revenue declined by 2.0% on a linked quarter basis and grew 5.7% compared with the year earlier. The year-over-year revenue growth was primarily driven by solid loan growth funded by strong deposit growth and strength across our fee businesses.","Turning to Slide 11, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $3.0 billion in the first quarter, essentially stable with the fourth quarter despite fewer \u2013 two fewer days in the quarter. Net interest income was up 3.7% compared with the prior year, reflecting earning asset growth from a year ago. Slide 12 highlights trends in non-interest income, which decreased by 4.2% versus the fourth quarter, reflecting typical seasonal patterns and a decrease in mortgage banking revenue of 14%. The mortgage revenue decline was in line with our guidance and reflects both seasonality and a drop in refinancing activity due to higher interest rates. On a year-over-year basis, non-interest income increased by 8.4%, driven by strength in payment services revenue, trust and investment management fees and mortgage banking revenue.","I will highlight a couple of items within non-interest income. Trust and investment fees increased 8.6% year-over-year, reflecting new account growth and improved market conditions, along with lower money market fee waivers. Credit and debit card revenue increased 9.8% on higher credit card sales of 8.5% and total card sales volumes of 6.2%. Credit and debit card revenue increased 6.8%, excluding the impact of an acquired portfolio. The increase in other income was primarily due to higher equity investment income. Merchant processing revenue grew 2.7% on a year-over-year basis, adjusted for the impact of currency rate changes. This is a slower pace than we have seen in previous quarters and reflects several factors, including the impact of higher EMV related equipment sales revenue in the first quarter of 2016, the margin impact of certain interchange caps implemented in Europe in late 2015 and our decision to exit certain high volume, low margin merchant relationships last year. We are growing merchant relationships in this business, but the impact to volumes and revenue is being muted somewhat by these factors. We expect this masking effect will begin to dissipate in the second quarter. By the third quarter, merchant acquiring revenue is expected to return to a more normal rate of growth, a trajectory of same-store sales plus about 2%, excluding the impact of foreign currency changes.","Turning to Slide 13, non-interest expense decreased 2.0% compared with the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting seasonally lower costs related to investments in tax advantaged projects, professional services expense and marketing and business development. On a year-over-year basis, non-interest expense increased 7.1%. Growth was driven by higher compensation and employee benefit expenses, reflecting the impact of merit increases, higher variable compensation, including performance based incentives and stock based compensation and hiring to support business growth and risk management programs. The increase in marketing and development expense reflected investment in the brand and various business initiatives. Other expense was up 6.2%, reflecting the impact of the FDIC surcharge, which began in the third quarter of 2016 and an insurance recovery last year.","Slide 14 highlights our capital position. At March 31, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented was 9.2%, which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement and our internal target of 8.5%. In the first quarter, we returned 78% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We expect to remain in our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 80% going forward.","I will now provide some forward-looking guidance. In the second quarter, we look for modest growth in net interest income on a tax \u2013 fully taxable equivalent basis, driven by improved loan growth compared with the first quarter and slightly higher net interest margin. Credit card, mortgage and auto loan growth are seasonally stronger in the second quarter. Additionally, we look for improved commercial loan growth in the second quarter as well. However, the timing of anticipated policy changes are difficult to predict. Also, given the current yield curve and rate expectations, corporate clients are continuing to access the capital markets, which may impact that growth in commercial loans in the short-term. Therefore, we think meaningful acceleration in commercial loan growth is more likely to occur in the second half of 2017. Finally, we remain disciplined in lending to the CRE market and growth in that category will likely remain muted in the near-term. We look for mortgage revenue to increase compared with the first quarter.","The second quarter is seasonally stronger, as home sales strengthen in the spring and we are well positioned to gain share in the purchase market over time. Industry refinancing activity is projected to continue at lower levels, reflecting higher mortgage rates. Expenses will be seasonally higher in the second quarter, but as previously mentioned, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the full year. Given the underlying mix of quality of our loan portfolio, we expect credit equality to remain relatively stable in the second quarter and we expect the loan loss provision to increase in line with loan growth. The taxable equivalent income tax rate was 27.0% in the first quarter compared with 28.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease reflected the impact of new accounting guidelines related to stock based compensation effective for the first quarter of 2017.","We estimate the taxable equivalent income tax rate in the second quarter of 2017 will be approximately 28%. Finally, in the first quarter, we provided notice to redeem all of our Series G preferred stock and issued $1 billion of Series J preferred stock. The total quarterly dividend \u2013 preferred dividend \u2013 the total quarterly preferred dividend for the quarter was $69 million. Included in the determination of diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2017 was an additional charge of $10 million related to the Series G issuance cost. Looking to future quarters, given our current capital structure, the level of preferred dividends will be about $63 million in the second and fourth quarters of each year and $70 million in the first and third quarters of each year. Of course, the $10 million issuance charge will not reoccur.","Let me hand it back to Andy for closing comments.","Andy Cecere","Thanks Terry. So to summarize, we feel good about where we are and how we are positioned and even better about where we are headed. I look forward to leading this company through the next phase of its evolution. Our Chairman and former CEO, Richard Davis\u2019 leadership has set us up well for the future. And I am grateful for his guidance and partnership over the last 10 years that we have worked together. Our businesses are strong and our culture of innovation is intact. So as I transition into my new role, you should not expect major changes to the strategic direction of this company, given our industry leading performance. You should expect an ongoing focus on innovation, continuous improvement in our customers and employees.","That concludes our formal remarks. Terry, Bill and I will now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from John McDonald with Bernstein.","Andy Cecere","Good morning John.","John McDonald","Good morning guys. I am wondering about the expenses Terry, what kind of step-up in expenses should we kind of be thinking about for the second quarter and just remind us, where does that seasonality occur, which lines?","Terry Dolan","Yes. So if you end up thinking about the second quarter, we are going to typically see it growing probably 3% to 4% in the second quarter relative to first quarter. As John, we have talked in some of our investor conferences, we still expect pressure with respect to risk programs, at least through the end of the second quarter, with the trajectory of that growth starting to slow as we get later into the year. So when we think about positive operating leverages as far as expenses are concerned, we are pretty confident that we are going to deliver on positive operating leverage for the full year.","John McDonald","Okay. But maybe we shouldn\u2019t expect efficiency ratio improvement in the second quarter and it probably gets better late in the second half?","Terry Dolan","That\u2019s the way that we are thinking about it. I think it\u2019s going to probably start to plateau and then as it gets later into the year, it\u2019s going to start to come down.","Andy Cecere","So, John, this is Andy. I do think we are sort of at our high level. It will be flattish in the second quarter and then start to come down as we achieved that positive operating leverage in quarters three and four.","John McDonald","Okay. And Andy, what kind of loan growth outlook do you have nearer term? How much do you think you can get better in the second quarter and what drives your confidence that we could accelerate further in the back half of the year?","Andy Cecere","Sure. So first of all, our starting point is a little higher versus where we ended the fourth quarter. Secondly, our pipelines are stronger. As Terry mentioned, a lot of our corporate clients were accessing the Capital Markets, so that did put a bit of a damper on loan growth. But the seasonality on home equity, what we are seeing on auto and what\u2019s going on with the corporate loan growth tells me that the second quarter is going to be stronger than the first quarter, but probably not as strong as what we achieved some quarters last year, but I do see acceleration here in quarter two.","John McDonald","Okay. And then last thing, Terry, can you just give us some thoughts on the net interest margin? What are the puts and takes going forward for next quarter and how much improvement could you see? We got the March hike. And what do you think for the second quarter NIM?","Terry Dolan","Yes. I think net interest margin as we said is going to end up expanding, but it\u2019s going to end up expanding slightly, I think in the second quarter. We do see growth in the net interest margin as we get into the third and fourth quarter. Part of the growth in the first quarter of 5 basis points, some of the factors that will help us as we go into second quarter is we are starting to see that inflection point in terms of the investment security portfolio, so that will help us a little bit. Cash balances will be a little bit higher, which will put some pressure on it. When we end up looking at kind of all of those, the growth quarter-over-quarter is going to be in the basis point or so.","John McDonald","Okay, thank you.","Andy Cecere","Thanks, John.","Operator","Your next question is from John Pancari with Evercore.","Andy Cecere","Good morning, John.","John Pancari","On the \u2013 back to the loan growth expectation, I know you indicated that as the capital markets weighed near-term, but you expect that could be strengthening. What type of annual growth rate do you expect for this year in overall loan growth? And then as you look into a more normalized macro improving type of environment, what is the go-forward loan growth that you think USB is capable of for next year, for example?","Terry Dolan","Right. So, one of the things that we talked about last quarter is that we thought that loan growth for the year would probably be in the 6% to 8% sort of range. And certainly, as we look at where the first quarter has occurred, that\u2019s going to be hard to achieve, but we think it\u2019s going to be middle single-digits, if you will, for the year. We also do believe that second quarter is going to start to get stronger and that\u2019s going to start to accelerate as the year progresses. And so as we think about 2018, we certainly believe that, that 6% to 8% is very reasonable as we think about the future.","John Pancari","Okay, great. Thanks. And then back to the expense topic. Appreciate the color you gave, but just looking at the efficiency ratio, more of on a long-term basis as well. I know you are sitting there at 55.5% for the quarter. How could we expect that, that will trend as we look into \u201818, if you can give a little bit of color? Thanks.","Andy Cecere","So John, as we have said, we expect our efficiency ratio to be in the low 50s and that\u2019s still our goal and our target and that\u2019s what we are planning to. I would say, again, that this quarter was at our highest level, our high point and we are going to start to achieve downward trend, particularly in the second half of this year and I would expect the same trend next year as we achieve positive operating leverage.","John Pancari","Okay, great. And then lastly on the credit side, I know you indicated you don\u2019t originate sub-prime auto, but do you have a component of your auto book that is sub-prime that is migrated that way?","Andy Cecere","No. I mean, obviously, if somebody goes delinquent and they get scored out, they will wind up with a FICO below 620, but that\u2019s just normal migration. So \u2013 but I mean, we have a very high-quality auto loan book. The origination FICOs are 770 plus. On the leasing side, it\u2019s even a higher credit quality portfolio. FICOs are over 780. So anybody that winds up with a 620 or less FICO is just somebody that\u2019s probably lost their job and has payment issues.","John Pancari","Okay, great. Thank you.","Terry Dolan","Thanks, John.","Operator","Your next question is from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Andy Cecere","Good morning, Matt.","Ricky Dodds","Hey, guys. This is actually Ricky Dodds from Matt\u2019s team. Just a quick question on the professional services line down quite a bit on a linked quarter basis, I was just wondering how should we be thinking about that line going forward and If the first quarter number is a good starting point to sort of model off of? And then maybe another question on the other fees line item, obviously that line item is a little lumpy historically. Wondering if you could remind us maybe what is in that line item that makes it so lumpy and then perhaps provide a good run-rate going forward? Thanks.","Terry Dolan","Yes. So, let me take the professional services fee piece first, Ricky. And if you end up thinking about that, that is an area where a lot of business initiatives comes through and a lot of expense related too, for example, some of the risk compliance programs. It\u2019s also very seasonal. It\u2019s very \u2013 it\u2019s seasonally high in the fourth quarter. First quarter comes down to the levels that you are seeing and then it starts to ratchet up as business initiatives are put into place and as the year kind of progresses. So, we do expect that it\u2019s going to be a line category that is going to go up. As we get later into the year and especially as we kind of start getting into 2018 though I think some of the pressure related to professional fees as is related to risk management compliance programs is going to start to alleviate. And so I think that is an area for opportunity as we start looking at next year, but second quarter definitely is going to be seasonally up third quarter and then fourth quarter is usually the high watermark for professional services fees. In terms of other revenue, other revenue is a combination of a whole variety of different things. It ends up including equity investment income, some trading income, sometimes syndications \u2013 part loan syndications is a part of that, retail product revenue, insurance product revenue. And so it can be very lumpy depending upon what\u2019s happening that particular quarter. Year-over-year, it\u2019s up a little bit, but relative to the fourth quarter, we had some CDC syndication fees that were a part of that. So, it tends to be a little bit lumpy.","Ricky Dodds","Okay, thanks, guys.","Andy Cecere","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Couple of questions. First, sort of a bigger picture strategy question. I know, Andy, you mentioned that you shouldn\u2019t expect any meaningful change in strategy, but wanted to ask about your branch strategy specifically. You haven\u2019t, since the crisis, really changed your branch count that much, especially relative to peers. You have also had very strong deposit growth over this time period and continue to. So maybe that\u2019s playing a role. But going forward, how do you think about the ideal network size, especially given changes in consumer behavior and frankly some pressure to achieve positive operating leverage?","Andy Cecere","So Saul, you are right. The branches are a great source of deposits. We recognize that. And I think that will become even more important as we move into a higher interest rate scenario. At the same time, you are also right that transactions in our branch are reducing. So, 60% of transactions today are done digitally outside of the branch. So what we have done and we will continue to do is change the footprint of the branch in terms of reducing the square footage and we have done that for the past few years and we continue to focus on that. We have also had some reductions in the number of branches and I would expect that to continue. So, overall, the footprint space, so to speak, in our branch network will come down. The number of people handling transactions will come down, but it does continue to be an important source of deposit growth. And for that reason, we will have branches as we do, but fewer square footage, fewer branches, less space.","Saul Martinez","Okay. Do you give any sort of magnitude or sense of the magnitude of how much you are reducing square footage or the proportion of branches that are being refurbished or remodeled?","Andy Cecere","Yes. From the number of perspectives, we have been calling branches in the neighborhood of 50 to 100 last few years and I would expect this to continue for the next couple of years.","Saul Martinez","Got it. And then a more specific question on credit quality, credit card specifically. The charge-off rates didn\u2019t move up, 37, I think a year ago, it\u2019s 32.6. So, obviously, there is some seasonality component quarter-on-quarter, but year-on-year, there is some increase, and I know you talked about retail and sub-prime auto, but anything there? What\u2019s driving that, anything to be worried about in terms of the trajectory on your credit card book?","Andy Cecere","Short answer, nothing to be worried about. As you recall, we have grown our \u2013 all of our loan portfolios throughout this cycle. So we do have seasoning impact there. We have had good \u2013 that acquisitions. We have had good organic growth, especially out of the branches. So there is nothing there that \u2013 we saw the same seasonal patterns and delinquencies, so we see nothing that concerns us. It\u2019s all within expectation. We expect that the latter half of the year, those rates will come back down depending upon the balance.","Saul Martinez","Got it, right. Okay. Can you remind me what you \u2013 I think you mentioned in your Investor Day, but what the through the cycle charge-offs are for your credit card book?","Andy Cecere","Yes. I think we tagged that. It\u2019s either, like, 4.75 or 5, somewhere in that range.","Saul Martinez","Okay. So you are still well within that?","Andy Cecere","Yes.","Saul Martinez","Alright, very good. Thanks a lot.","Terry Dolan","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Terry Dolan","Good morning Ken.","Amanda Larsen","Hi, this is Amanda Larsen on for Ken. Can you talk about the pushes and pulls on balance sheet growth, average earning assets were down quarter-over-quarter for the first time in many years and I guess that balance sheet size the product of deposit growth in the opportunities that growing loans, but you remain out of cash into loans and securities also shrinking the balance sheet this quarter and I am wondering if this is \u2013 if this will be more indicative of your future plans and lower deposit, lower growth quarter as you focus on profitability over volume?","Terry Dolan","Yes. I mean, so if you are all looking at just kind of the shifting of earning assets, I mean we are holding a little bit more cash balances than what we have in the past and that\u2019s for things like liquidity purposes, etcetera and the fact that we have had stronger deposit growth over the course of last couple of quarters. In terms of loan growth, I think we have kind of talked about the mechanics of that. Our investment securities is really going to grow in line with what our liquidity requirements are at any particular point in time. From a deposit standpoint, in terms of pricing, we are just really looking at being very competitive with respect to deposit pricing. But right now, deposit beta has been fairly inelastic. So we don\u2019t see a lot of changes relative to where we are at. I think it is fairly indicative in terms of what you are going to see going forward.","Andy Cecere","And Terry, I would say most of the fluctuation occurred in the fourth quarter was function of cash levels. And that can be volatile given the deposit flows and given the loan growth. So if you look at our loan portfolio that was up 7.2% [ph]. Our securities were relatively stable. And cash from around a bit, probably up a little bit more cash as we were before.","Amanda Larsen","Okay, great. And then fees were good across the board, can you talk about pipelines and commercial product revenue and also some of the headwinds and tailwinds in the payment line, it looks like corporate payment products may turn into growth, but that merchant processing slowed?","Terry Dolan","Yes. No, I think that is true. I mean we did see really nice growth with respect to credit card. And one of the areas that I would also kind of focus on is in the commercial payments space. We saw some very nice growth. Linked quarter is about 4.7%. On a year-over-year basis is about 5.3%. It\u2019s one of the things we are seeing and we started making some business investment in that, a little over a year ago in terms of technology. We rolled out kind of virtual card offerings and innovations. And we are also seeing a little bit of a tailwind as a result of fuel prices getting a little stronger. So that\u2019s some of the things that are benefiting us. In terms of commercial business sort of spend, in that particular category. And then in the first quarter, we are starting to see government spend expanding a little bit up, which is a little bit unusual for the first quarter. It was up about 2.2% year-over-year. And we are seeing stronger defense spending in the sense of the election, it\u2019s maybe the way that we would categorize that. On the merchant \u2013 merchant acquiring and merchant processing revenue, I did talk a little bit about it. But again, the drivers behind the 1.3%, part of that is the foreign currency, so that gets you to about 2.7%. We, as part of the kind of chip and PIN sort of rollout in the whole \u2013 in that whole topic, our EMV equipment sales were strong at the end of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. But relative to the industry, we are more penetrated in terms of chip technology with about 66%, 67% penetration at this particular point in time relative to the industry, which is closer to about 40%. And so in the first quarter of this year, we are kind of just continuing to see that. Now, that will abate as we get into the second quarter and into the third quarter as well. And then I think the other thing that\u2019s been \u2013 the other two things that\u2019s been impacting that is that we just have margin compression that\u2019s been occurring in Europe because of the interchange caps that were put into place in late 2015. That\u2019s getting close to the end, which is good to see. And then as we said, we have been exiting some high volume, low margin sort of merchants. And so that has impacted revenue a little bit, but it certainly has impacted volumes. And so when we think about merchant acquiring revenue for the second quarter, we do believe that, that is going to get stronger as some of these factors start to abate. And it\u2019s going to become more normalized in the third quarter. And we think about that \u2013 we usually think about it in terms of same-store sales plus 1% to 2% in terms of what the revenues should look like.","Andy Cecere","And Terry, let me reemphasize something you said. The corporate payment systems in the past few years seems to have had a headwind either in the government side because of lower government spend or on the corporate side as some large corporations slow down their expense spending. This was a quarter that we actually saw growth in both. And that was very positive on the corporate side [indiscernible] some of that innovation on the government side because some of the increased spend. And we continue to expect growth in both of those. So that\u2019s an important turn in terms of the growth trajectory for corporate payment systems.","Amanda Larsen","Okay. And just one last one on the commercial product revenue thinking about pipelines into 2Q, I know you had a good quarter this 1Q, but then also last year 2Q is seems like a tough comp, so what you are seeing on that [indiscernible] activity, is it possible you can post year-over-year growth next February? Thank you.","Terry Dolan","Yes. Well, certainly, on a year-over-year basis, we do believe that. The second quarter tended to be a little bit stronger last year because of some of the Brexit things in terms of second quarter. But the pipeline, in terms of syndication and fixed income capital markets, continues to be strong. We do expect, given the current rate environment and just kind of some of the things our large corporate customers are doing, that they will continue to access the capital markets. Our capital market revenue was up very strong in the first quarter. We would expect it to stay at higher levels going into the second quarter. So we think that that\u2019s a pretty good outlook. And of course, by those large corporate customers accessing the capital markets, that has been impacting our loan growth to some extent. But we do see that continuing.","Amanda Larsen","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Andy Cecere","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning.","Terry Dolan","Hi Erika.","Erika Najarian","So just wanted to ask a question on the trajectory of deposit costs from here, as you mentioned, deposit betas remained quite low, I did notice that there was a 10 basis point quarterly up-tick in money market savings and I was wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on perhaps a different competitive dynamics of the different deposit products and also you mentioned an eventual 50% deposit beta, but what is the realistic trajectory in 2017 if we only get one or two more rate hikes?","Terry Dolan","Yes. So let me kind of talk about it. Again, betas overall, if we end up looking at December of \u201815, December of \u201816, March of \u201817, typically what we have seen and we are pretty much on track on this is well in terms of the March hike, is that deposit betas have been up about 20%, 20% to 25% kind of in that ballpark. We have a strong retail deposit base that represents about 50% of our overall deposits. And the pricing from that particular standpoint has been pretty inelastic thus far. So we haven\u2019t seen a lot of movement in terms of retail deposits. And certainly for the next rate hike, I don\u2019t expect that we are going to see a lot of movements. There may be a little bit more pressure, but we still think there is room and opportunity there. On the wholesale side, which represents about 30% of our overall deposits, we are seeing kind of what I would say, selective competitive pressure and the deposit betas with respect to that or closer to the kind of 25% to 30% kind of in that ballpark. And then our corporate trust business, which will be unique to us, represents about 18% of our overall deposits. That tends to be a little bit more sensitive to interest rates. And so we are seeing pressure in terms of movement of interest rates is going to be in that space. As we think about kind of the rest of the year and certainly, the next rate hike or so, that 20% to 25% deposit beta probably starts to migrate to 30%, 35% and that would be \u2013 what I would think we would see kind of through this year. It\u2019s really going to depend upon how many rate hikes and how quickly they come. I just want to point out is that when we model a rate hike movement, certainly as we get a few rate hikes out, we are going to see deposit betas. There is going to be just more competitive pressure there in the future. So that\u2019s kind of how the way we think about it.","Erika Najarian","Thank you. And just as a second question. Andy, we totally get the message as a marketplace that it\u2019s going to be business as usual and no large change in strategy, I am wondering if you could remind us on how U.S. Bancorp, over the next 2 years or 3 years is thinking about inorganic growth in terms of use of its excess capital, especially in a world where your consent order is listed or you don\u2019t have any [indiscernible] restrictions in terms of inorganic growth?","Andy Cecere","Right. So we have \u2013 as you know Erika, we have been doing some portfolio deals, credit card transactions, some payments transactions as well as trust and fund services. So those types of things, we are not precluded from doing. They are high return, low capital usage businesses and we will continue to focus on them. We are precluded from branch transactions until we are out of the consent order. And we will look at opportunities there to increase market share, our depth of participation on market as that presents itself. But we are well positioned with both organic growth that we have today and our opportunities for acquisition with the current model. So we are not really prohibited from what we want to do.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you.","Andy Cecere","Sure.","Operator","Your next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","Andy Cecere","Hi, Vivek.","Vivek Juneja","Hi, Andy. Hi, Terry. A couple of follow-ups on those questions that have come up, Andy can you remind us where you are in terms of your expectations for timing on when you get out of that anti-money laundering issue?","Andy Cecere","So there are three components with the concenter and I am going to ask Bill to fill in the details. But the way I think about it simply, there is the people process side and that we are done with that. The second is the technology component, which will be done this summer. And the third is the sustainability component, which is really a function of the regulators improving the sustainability. And that one has a little bit more in terms of uncertainty of timing.","Bill Parker","So Andy hit on it right. We got it late 2015. We had already been working on it for well over 1 year. So last year was a year of build, this year is a year of installing some of the new technology enhancements. We are pretty much at a full staffing level. So towards the end of the year, we expect to be able to demonstrate sustainability. And then from there, it\u2019s getting all the external parties comfortable with validations and etcetera. So that\u2019s how we think about the timing.","Vivek Juneja","Do you think you get out of the whole thing from the regulators by end of this year, early next year, any sense of where you think the timing lands?","Bill Parker","Yes. Again, towards the end of this year is when we will be demonstrating sustainability. So that\u2019s \u2013 after that, it\u2019s up to the auditors and regulators.","Vivek Juneja","Okay, great. Separate question, other income, which was up 16% year-on-year, you have mentioned in the release that higher equity investment gains, can you give us some perspective that\u2019s pretty nice jump in other income, what is the run rate of equity investment income and what is the dollar amount of equity investments?","Terry Dolan","I have never gotten into the dollar amount associated with equity investments simply because other revenue represents the whole bunch of different categories, I will tell you that as we think about the second quarter Vivek, that we do believe that the equity investment income is we are \u2013 going to be pretty consistent based upon anything that we see right now, pretty consistent with the first quarter. So we wouldn\u2019t expect to see a lot of movement up or down in terms of equity investment.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. Lastly, auto lease residuals, can you talk a little bit about that, there has been some concerns about that item, given concerns about lot of leases coming off in the next couple of years?","Andy Cecere","So Vivek, this is Andy. That has come back. So as you know, that was in the $700, $800 level last year, migrated down to about $200 of gain in the first quarter. But I will tell you in April, it\u2019s back up to the $800 to $900 level. So it\u2019s bounced back. Part of that it because it will slow down in production, which has eased the pressure on used car prices, so that has bounced back.","Vivek Juneja","Alright. Thanks Andy.","Andy Cecere","You bet.","Operator","Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Andy Cecere","Good morning Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, a couple of questions and follow-ups, one is on the deposit rates that you showed on your slide deck where for time deposits, you did increase this past quarter, but there was some outflow and I am just wondering, I know for quite a while, you have been shrinking time deposits, not necessarily most efficient way of gathering deposits, but I am wondering, from here on in is that strategy still hold or should we expect that you are going to try to regain some activity there?","Andy Cecere","Yes. From a time deposit standpoint, that\u2019s really kind of a function of what sort of funding we need in order to be able to support loan growth. So in some respect it\u2019s kind of a function of how much loan growth we end up seeing. If we do continue to see rising rates, that we may have kind of change our pricing strategy a little bit with respect to time deposits, especially as we get into a period of time I don\u2019t know whether it will be the next rate hike or the following where retail deposits become more sensitive to rising rates. Then you may see us kind of shifting that strategy in order to kind of lock in some of the deposit pricing associated with time deposits. But right now, based on what we are seeing in the relatively inelastic retail deposits, I don\u2019t anticipate that we would change a lot.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then my other follow-up is on the commercial real estate, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, not really looking to grow that line item and in fact strength of it being conservative, maybe just you can speak to some of the reasons why and touch on if any of that has to do with regulatory reviews or CCAR process, etcetera?","Bill Parker","Betsy, this is Bill. Last part first, none of it has to do with the [Technical Difficulty] regulatory or CCAR process. If you look at the CRE line and you look at the two pieces, the piece has been declining is the standing loan or mortgage loan part. So that\u2019s as other banks have offered long-term fixed rates or not interested in doing that, loving non-recourse. We are not \u2013 we have our set appetite for that. And then just the insurance markets, etcetera. So that\u2019s the piece that\u2019s been declining. On the construction, we enjoyed fairly rapid growth there for a while. That has slowed, but that\u2019s in part because of our own client base. They are getting more cautious on multi-family side and obviously, we follow our clients. So we do look at the high asset values in some of the CRE markets right now, some of the different markets. So our borrowers are cautious, our customers are cautious, we are cautious. But we still anticipate construction, both to grow, just not at the same rates that they used to.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then just lastly on the C&I, I saw the comments around how large corporates are refinancing in the capital markets driving pay downs, a little bit of pressure there on the C&I loan balance, but what about the mid-market side, is that \u2013 are you seeing the same thing there and what degree of interest do you think there is in increasing loan utilizations, just separating out large versus mid?","Terry Dolan","Yes. So when we end up looking at loan growth, C&I loan growth, we did see good growth in the middle market space. And so on a year-over-year basis, middle-market was actually up about 8.7%. And on a linked quarter basis, it was up about 2.5%. It represents about 13% to 15% of our overall portfolio. We are seeing that type of growth across the whole variety of different markets. We have seen good growth in places like Nevada, Utah, Colorado, here in the Twin Cities, Kansas City, Wisconsin, just kind of across the board. So as we kind of talk to our folks, we talk to our clients, we are not seeing the same level of access to the capital markets. So that impacts really more on the large corporate space. And we would expect the middle market to continue to grow. The other thing I would say is as we look into the second quarter, part of the middle market is our community banking space and we typically see lift in the second quarter as the ag lending starts to kick in and so both of those would be areas that we would look for opportunity as we think about the second quarter.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, that\u2019s great. Yes.","Andy Cecere","I was just going to add one other thing that in the first quarter, we did see several hundred million of pay-downs in our energy portfolio and we don\u2019t expect that to repeat as the portfolio is stabilizing and improving, but we did have large number of pay-downs in the first quarter, so...","Betsy Graseck","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And just lastly the definition between middle-market and large corporate for you?","Terry Dolan","Yes. It\u2019s kind of based upon size. It\u2019s about $10 million.","Andy Cecere","$10 million in sales, Betsy.","Terry Dolan","Yes, the middle-market is the $500 million, above that\u2019s the large corp.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, super. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin Barker","Hi, good morning. Thanks for your time today. Just a quick follow-up on the auto side. Given the decline we have seen in used car prices, I was wondering how you are thinking about the residuals on your auto lease book and how they might be performing relative to your expectations, in particular, just maybe you have increased the depreciation rate on those leases and just really how you are mitigating the residual risk on that book?","Andy Cecere","So Kevin, I mentioned before that the residuals have actually come back here in the early second quarter, back to the normalized levels, I would say. They dipped down in the first quarter. You are absolutely correct, but they did come back. We are already very conservative in the way we think about residuals and the way we book them. So we are not changing anything there and the market has come back.","Kevin Barker","Great, thanks.","Andy Cecere","Sure.","Operator","The next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning.","Andy Cecere","Hey, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you guys share with us the AHA data as recently as this past Friday showed the home equity loans continue to shrink for the industry. Yours have pretty much held in flat now for a year. Can you tell us what your guys are seeing in their frontlines, why this portfolio is not growing faster since housing prices have obviously come back quite a bit from the lows of the crisis?","Andy Cecere","Well, couple \u2013 I mean, we still \u2013 we have actively originated our product out of our branches throughout this whole cycle. So, we still have $1.5 billion, $2 billion of originations every quarter and we do pull our folks on what their intended uses are. And it is as you would expect on a traditional home equity, people want to improve the kitchen or whatever. But as home prices have really rebounded, a lot of folks are able to refinance out both first mortgage and our home equity line, lock in a new lower fixed rate. So I think that\u2019s what we are seeing right now is a refinancing of all, both the first and second loan, but our origination volume has held in there very steady.","Terry Dolan","And the growth in the utilization, I think, will drive growth.","Andy Cecere","Yes, right.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. You guys have been very steady and predictable on the amount of capital you return to shareholders. What kind of environment would have to develop where you may lift that number closer to 100% of earnings or slightly above it?","Terry Dolan","Well, Gerard, we are in a good spot right now. Our capital levels are such that \u2013 and our returns are such that our capital formula works. In other words, we are able to generate enough to return that 60% to 80%. We are at the high 70s right now and still accommodate balance sheet growth. So, I don\u2019t see a scenario that we are getting to that 100% as far as the near-term as long as we are continuing to achieve balance sheet growth, which is what I expect. And again, we are in a good spot. We are not sitting here in a big excess position today.","Gerard Cassidy","No, I agree. I totally agree. And then finally, when you guys are talking about the inorganic growth acquisitions, obviously, depositories are off the table for the time being. Are you \u2013 would you consider \u2013 or can you purchase a wealth manager if you felt that fit into your current wealth management strategies?","Andy Cecere","Components of the wealth business, we could do that and it is a level of \u2013 area of interest for us. Wealth is one of our growth businesses. We are doing a great job organically already, but if there are opportunities that present themselves, we will take a look.","Terry Dolan","Yes. And Gerard, what I would say is that in that particular space, we are not interested in what I would call traditional asset managers, but where we found a good fit in terms of a real wealth manager, I think those are things we would take a look at, because culturally, that would be a better fit for us.","Andy Cecere","Exactly.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Thank you, guys.","Andy Cecere","Thanks.","Operator","Your final question is from Brian Klock with Keith, Bruyette, & Woods.","Brian Klock","Good morning, gentlemen.","Andy Cecere","Hi, Brian.","Terry Dolan","Yes, Brian.","Brian Klock","It\u2019s a follow-up question. And actually I missed I had to jump off a little bit so I might have apologized if I answered this already. On the loan growth side and thinking about the NII growth for the second quarter versus the first quarter, I mean, should we be thinking about last year\u2019s second quarter, you had a really strong 1.5% on annualized growth in total loans. Like with the commentary about maybe some slower rebound for the second half of the year in commercial, should we be thinking about with overall 1%ish maybe loan growth into the second quarter on a linked quarter basis? And does that sort of drive the NII growth quarter-over-quarter?","Andy Cecere","So Brian, we achieved 2.2% in the first quarter. What we said is given the pipelines, the expectations of some seasonality we expect that to accelerate into the second quarter, but not likely to get to that 1 and 1.5. So the way you can think about it is sort of 0.2 to the mid 0.5 somewhere in that area.","Brian Klock","Okay, great. Thank you. And I guess kind of follow up on the auto leasing side. There has been some pretty strong growth year-over-year. Just thinking about if there is the issues around the residuals and how that may impact the amount that\u2019s financed by the purchaser. I guess, you guys think that you may see some slowing growth in that \u2013 the auto leasing book?","Terry Dolan","Our leasing group is doing a great job. They are taking share. They have a great product. They have been consistent in the marketplace, good turnaround time. So I think that continues to be an area of opportunity for us. And as a reminder, everything we are doing there is prime. So, it\u2019s good business and it\u2019s good credit quality business.","Andy Cecere","Yes. Brian, the other thing that I would end up saying is that if you end up looking at the competitive landscape, we offer both the retail leasing as well as the auto lending. And so when customers come into the dealership then we also have very strong relationships with the dealership. So when they are coming into the dealer make a decision upon about buying a loan or buying a car or leasing that car, we have the ability in that prime space to be able to go either way. And I think that\u2019s, from a competitive standpoint, one of the reasons why we see the growth.","Terry Dolan","With longstanding relationships.","Andy Cecere","Yes.","Brian Klock","That\u2019s very helpful.

Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Cecere, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 11:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time through Tuesday, April 24, at midnight Eastern Daylight Time. I will now turn the conference call over to Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.","Judith T. Murphy","Thank you, Brooke, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's first quarter 2012 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analysts' schedules, are available on our website at usbank.com. ","I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. ","I will now turn the call over to Richard.","Richard K. Davis","Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to share our results with you today, and I'll begin with the highlights on Page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bank recorded net income of $1.3 billion for the first quarter of 2012 or $0.67 per diluted common share. Total net revenue was higher by 9.1% over the same quarter of 2011, driven by 7.3% growth in net interest income and 11.3% growth in fee revenue. ","Total average loans grew year-over-year and linked quarter by 6.4% and 1.5%, respectively, and we also experienced strong loan growth and total average deposits of 11.7% over the prior year and 2.2% linked quarter. Credit Quality continued to improve as net charge-offs declined by 8.2%, and nonperforming assets decreased in total by 8.5% from the prior quarter. ","We continue to generate significant capital each quarter. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 8.7% at March 31, or 8.4% using anticipated Basel III guidelines, while the Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 10.9%. Capital actions this quarter included a 56% dividend increase, and we repurchased 16 million shares of common stock during the first quarter. ","The 5-quarter trends of our industry-leading performance metrics are shown on the left-hand side of Slide 4. Return on average assets in the first quarter was 1.6%, and return on average common equity was 16.2%. We've stated that our company can achieve a normalized ROA in the range of 1.6% to 1.9% and an ROE between 16% and 19%. Both performance ratios have now reached their respective ranges. ","Our net interest margin and efficiency ratio are shown on the graph on the right-hand side of Slide 4. This quarter's net interest margin of 3.6% was 9 basis points lower than the same quarter of last year but equal to the prior quarter, and Andy will discuss the margin in more detail in just a couple of minutes. Our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 51.9%, and consistent with our expectation, this ratio remained in the low 50s. ","Turning to Slide 5. Our capital position remains strong and continues to grow. At March 31, our Tier 1 common equity ratio, using anticipated Basel III guidelines, was 8.4%. At 8.4%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement and above the level of which we believe we need to be. ","Turning to Slide 6. On March 13, after receiving the results of our 2012 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review from the Federal Reserve, we announced a $0.28 or 56% increase in our annual dividend. In addition to the dividend increase, the board authorized a new 100 million share repurchase program. As we've indicated in the past, our long-term goal is to return between 60% and 80% of our earnings to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. During the first quarter, we returned 66% of our earnings to our shareholders, 29% of which in the form of dividends and 37% in the form of share buybacks. ","Average total loans outstanding increased by $12.6 billion or 6.6% year-over-year. As expected, linked quarter loan growth and average total of loans was 1.5%. Significantly, new loan originations, excluding mortgage production, plus new and renewed commitments, totaled over $36 billion this quarter. This represents a 4.5% year-over-year increase in new and renewed lending activity. ","Total revolving corporate and commercial commitments outstanding increased year-over-year by 25.7% and 5.1% on a linked quarter basis while utilization remained fairly consistent at approximately 25%. Total average deposits increased by $24 billion or 11.7% over the same quarter last year while total average deposits grew by $5 billion on a linked quarter basis or 2.2%. ","Turning to Slide 8. The company reported total net revenue in the first quarter of $4.9 billion, an increase of 9.1% over the prior quarter's -- year's quarter, but 3.4% less than previous quarter. Recall, however, that the fourth quarter included a $263 million litigation settlement gain. Excluding this gain, linked quarter revenue growth was $88 million or 1.8%. The company's revenue growth can be attributed to both our balance sheet and our fee businesses growing as we continue to benefit from our investments in growth initiatives over the past years. ","Turning to Slide 9 and Credit Quality. First quarter total net charge-offs declined by 8.2% from the fourth quarter of 2011 while nonperforming assets decreased by 8.5% or 5.9%, excluding covered assets. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 1.09%, improving from the 1.19% recorded in the fourth quarter. ","Turning to Slide 10. As the graph on the left illustrates, early- and late-stage delinquencies, excluding covered assets, improved this quarter. On the right-hand side of Slide 10, you can see that the trend in criticized assets continues to show improvement. Both of these statistics provide us with confidence that net charge-offs and nonperforming assets will trend lower in the second quarter of 2012, although net charge-offs may show a more modest reduction than in recent quarters as the pace of improvement slows in the consumer categories. Given the first quarter's credit results and the expected improvement going forward, we released $90 million of reserves compared with $125 million in the fourth quarter and $50 million in the first quarter of 2011. ","I'll now turn the call over to Andy.","Andrew Cecere","Thanks, Richard. Slide 11 gives you a view of our first quarter 2012 results versus comparable time periods. Diluted EPS of $0.67 was 28.8% higher than the first quarter of 2011 and 2.9% lower than the prior quarter. Recall that the fourth quarter EPS included $0.05 related to 2 notable items. ","Slide 12 lists the key drivers of the company's first quarter earnings. The 27.9% increase in net income year-over-year was the result of a 9.1% increase in net revenue and a decrease in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a 10.6% increase in noninterest expense. Net income was slightly lower on a linked quarter basis. The unfavorable variance was the result of a 3.4% decline in net revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense and a $16 million decrease in the provision for credit losses. Excluding the impact of the 2 notable items detailed on Slide 13, net revenue increased by 1.8% quarter-over-quarter and noninterest expense was flat. ","Slide 13 provides you more detail about the notable items that impacted the comparison of our first quarter to prior periods. In the fourth quarter of 2011, total noninterest income included a $263 million litigation settlement gain related to the termination of a merchant processing referral agreement. We also booked $130 million expense accrual related to mortgage servicing and foreclosure-related matters. ","On a net basis, these 2 items increased fourth quarter net income by approximately $92 million and EPS by $0.05. The first quarter of 2011 included a $46 million gain related to the acquisition of First Community Bank of New Mexico from the FDIC. Also noted in the bottom of Slide 13 are 2 revenue and expense classification changes that had an impact on comparisons to prior periods. ","Moving to Slide 14. Net interest income increased year-over-year by $183 million or 7.3%. The increase was largely driven by the $26.1 billion or 9.5% increase in average earning assets, as well as the benefit from strong growth in low-cost deposits. The growth in average earning assets was driven by planned increases in the securities portfolio and growth in average total loans, partially offset by a lower cash position at the Federal Reserve. ","The net interest margin of 3.60% was 9 basis points lower than the same quarter of last year due primarily to the expected increase in lower yielding investment securities, partially offset by lower cash balances at the Fed and the inclusion of a credit card balance transfer fee. On a linked quarter basis, net interest income was higher by $17 million. ","Average earning assets grew by $4.9 billion, and net interest margin was flat to the prior quarter. Margin was slightly better than expected this quarter primarily due to the inclusion of balance transfer fees and lower cash balances at the Fed. Given the current rate environment, we expect that net interest margin to be down a few basis points in the second quarter. ","The investment securities portfolio at March 31 totaled $74.3 billion. The balances were higher than December 31, as we took the opportunity to manage down our cash balances and purchase investment securities. We expect to main the investments -- maintain the investment securities portfolio at or around this level for the next few quarters. ","Slide 15 provides you with more detail behind the changes in average total loans outstanding. Average total loans grew by 6.4% year-over-year. Excluding covered loans, our runoff portfolio, average total loans increased by 8.7% year-over-year. As you can see on the chart, the increase in average total loans was principally due to strong growth in commercial loans and residential mortgages of 17.3% and 19.1%, respectively. Commercial loan growth has continued to accelerate over the past 5 quarters while growth in consumer lending has been less robust. On a linked quarter basis, the 1.5% increase in average total loans outstanding was also primarily driven by an increase in commercial loans, which grew by 3.4%, and residential real estate loans, which grew by 4.3%. ","Slide 16 provides more detail on the growth in total deposits over the past 5 quarters. Average total deposits grew by $24 billion or 11.7% year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, average deposits increased by $5 billion or 2.2%. Importantly, average low-cost deposits accounted for the majority of the increases on a year-over-year and linked quarter basis. ","Slide 17 provides more details around the changes in noninterest income on a year-over-year and linked quarter basis. Noninterest income increased by 11.3% over the same quarter of 2011. Mortgage Banking revenue was very strong this quarter as production increased by 58% year-over-year and gain-on-sale margins improved. Offsetting a portion of the growth in origination and sales fee income were an unfavorable net change in MSR valuation and related hedging of approximately $32 million and an increase in the repurchase reserve. ","In addition to Mortgage Banking, merchant processing services, deposit service charges and commercial products revenue also posted solid increases year-over-year. These positive variances were partially offset by lower credit card or debit card fees due to legislative changes to debit card interchange, as well as the change in classification of balance transfer fees. Offsetting the impact of these 2 items were legislative-related mitigation activity and higher transaction volumes. ","ATM services revenue was lower as the result of the change related to revenue passed through to others. And finally, other income in the first quarter of 2011 included a $46 million gain related to the FDIC transaction. ","On a linked quarter basis, noninterest income was lower by $192 million or 7.9%. This favorable variance was primarily the result of the merchant settlement gain in the fourth quarter of 2011, seasonally lower payments-related revenue and the revenue classification changes, partially offset by very strong Mortgage Banking activity. ","Slide 18 highlights noninterest expense, which was higher year-over-year by $246 million or 10.6%. The majority of the increase can be attributed to: higher compensation and benefits expense, representing additional staffing in the branches mortgage-related activities and business expansion initiatives; an increase in professional services, primarily due to technology and foreclosure review projects; as well as marketing and business development expense and other expense related to regulatory and insurance-related costs. These higher costs were partially offset by a decrease in net occupancy related to the change in ATM revenue pass-through to others. ","On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense was lower by $136 million or 5%, primarily due to the fourth quarter mortgage servicing accrual, occupancy expense, partially offset by seasonally higher employee benefits. The tax rate on a taxable equivalent basis was 30.9% in the first quarter of 2012 compared with 30.5% in the fourth quarter of 2011 and 29% in the first quarter of 2011. ","Slide 19 provides updated detail on the company's mortgage, purchase-related expense and the reserve for unexpected losses on repurchases and make-whole payments. For outstanding repurchases and make-whole request balances at March 31 was $134 million compared with $105 million at December 31. The increase, in addition to recent changes in the GSE sampling method, specifically higher sampling sizes, caused us to increase our mortgage representation and warranties reserve to $202 million. We do, however, expect mortgage repurchase requests to remain fairly stable over the next several quarters. ","I'll now talk -- turn the call back to Richard.","Richard K. Davis","Thanks, Andy. And to conclude our formal remarks, I turn your attention to Slide 20. The momentum continues. Words from the cover of our annual report that appropriately describe our 2011 accomplishments and performance, and our first quarter results demonstrated the momentum we've built over the past several years continues to build into the new year. ","In the first quarter, we grew our balance sheet and our customer base. We grew our net revenue. We continued to invest in our organic growth initiatives, as well as small but important fill-in acquisitions, including: the 10-branch banking franchise of BankEast in Knoxville, Tennessee; the Indiana Corporate Trust business from UMB Bank; and an institutional trust business from Union Bank in California. ","In the first quarter, our credit quality continued to improve. Our capital liquidity positions remained strong. And we grew our earnings and achieved industry-leading performance metrics for the quarter, and we were able to return 66% of our earnings to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. ","We continue to benefit from our investments in growth initiatives and innovation and in acquisitions. We continue to benefit from our prudent risk management and our diversified business model, and we benefit from our markets, both established and new. ","Today we'll be holding our Annual Meeting here in Minneapolis, our headquarter city. In addition to conducting the official business of the meeting, I'll be sharing our story of how we have managed this company through the downturn and we are continuing to capitalize on the momentum we've built. I'll also tell the shareholders how exceedingly proud I am of what we've accomplished and of the 64,000 remarkable and engaged employees that have contributed to our success. I look forward to the coming year as we grow even stronger for the benefit of our customers, employees, communities and, importantly, our shareholders. ","That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer questions from the audience.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.","Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","First of all, I guess I just wonder if you can give some color commentary around loan demand trends through the quarter. Do you still see -- are there any particular pockets of strength, weakness, sector -- either by sector or by geography?","Richard K. Davis","Sure. This is Richard. As we stated 90 days ago, we thought that the trends would slow from quarter 4, partly because of the seasonality of the new year. And we saw the ending of the quarter kind of slowing down, and we turned out to be correct. In this case, we're starting to see what I expected was a slow but seasonal increase as we move into quarter 2. Quarter 1 got stronger as it aged, and quarter 2 is looking at least as good as quarter 1, if not with slight biases on the positive side. It's across-the-board, Chris. Corporate Banking, commercial banking, Community Banking, small business, consumer, credit card, they're all showing slight improvements in terms of volume and applications. All of them are showing improvement in credit quality. And except for Commercial Real Estate, where we see strengths on the coasts and the larger cities that kind of line the 2 oceans, we don't see any other distinct geography to note except a nice, steady, kind of even increase across all business lines across all states where we do business in all 50. So we're feeling quite positive about the year as it ages. And as spring has sprung, we're looking -- things looking up pretty nicely. I've got Bill Parker here with me to maybe bring a little more color to the quality and the application volumes.","P. W. Parker","Yes. So I'll highlight small business because we did see a pretty good uptick in our small business application volume. It's been double digit in all of our different areas, whether it's SBA or the branch-originated small business. So that bodes well to see some strength in the small business markets. And I'll just comment on the credit and Commercial Real Estate. Multifamily is the one area that's very strong and particularly on the coast. In the other areas, Class A properties are highly valued. But if you get below Class A and the other asset classes, it's still -- I don't want to say weak, but it's not as strong, so. But overall, pretty positive.","Richard K. Davis","And we won't \u2013 we've said this before. We can compete on price, and we will to the right level, but we won't engage in price competition where it doesn't make sense for our company. And we won't get our loan volume on lower underwriting. We simply won't do that, and we haven't had to and we're not going to.","Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then the other thing I wanted to ask about was your mortgage servicing portfolio has started to grow significantly, and it had been flat the prior couple of quarters. And the last 2 quarters, it's kind of grown significantly. I'm wondering is that just a function of the strong production volume that we've had recently, or is -- or do you see that as a particular strategic growth opportunity in that some of the larger players are probably constrained in how they can grow their servicing business?","Richard K. Davis","Yes and yes. So it is a function of -- the latter informs the former. So we're having really nice market share improvement because we've stayed very active in this. We've added a lot of resources to continue to be relevant as a mortgage originator and a servicer. And because the market -- the dynamics have changed, we continue to enjoy even greater growth maybe than we might have thought. We have no limits on the kind of resources that we might pursue to this level because we see a market shift that you only get once in a lifetime. And we intend to enjoy it now and come out of this as probably, I don't know, in the top 5 for sure of mortgage servicing and production, and we're seeing that to come sooner than we thought.","Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And specifically, that -- is that something that you could imagine getting into the kind of stand-alone mortgage company kind of business and through acquisition? Or do you want to maintain mortgage production primarily out of the branches?","Richard K. Davis","Well, we do it through the branches and through corresponding networks, so that's not going to change. But like everything else, we don't want to be dominant in any one line of business. So no more that I want to be a credit card company with branches attached to it, I don't want to be a mortgage company with a credit card business. We really want to be a business that does the work for most of our customers and meet their needs, where we know them firsthand and where there's opportunity to extend that based on market share improvement, we'll take that as well. But Chris, you'll see us continue that kind of balanced view of revenue achieved through spread and fee income on a basis of diversity of types of business as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Could you maybe kind of flesh out some of your comments on the capital front? I mean, obviously, you're now kind of -- you're past the point where you would likely see any SIFI buffer or anything like that, and obviously, 2\/3 of the capital is a nice capital return. But as you kind of look out there, are there acquisition opportunities that we should be thinking about? Or how could that evolve over the course of the next year?","Andrew Cecere","Moshe, this is Andy. So our Tier 1 common Basel III standard is at 8.4%, probably a little higher than we would plan to be at, and part of that is the volatility around that ratio as it relates to OCI and the available-for-sale portfolio, as we enjoyed a bigger gain this quarter due to lower interest rates. So you'll see us somewhere in that 8.2% to 8.4% range depending upon that gain. Our capital plan was approved. And as we've talked about, we have a target of that sort of 30 to 40 dividends, 30 to 40 buybacks, somewhere within that range. That leaves us plenty of room for opportunities that present themselves in the marketplace for portfolio purchases or small deals, just like we've done been in the past. And I think we're sort of in a normal, regular ongoing capital distribution methodology as we sit today with some dividends, some buybacks and some return for internal investment.","Richard K. Davis","And Moshe, what you saw last quarter would be a great proxy for future quarters in terms of M&A branch opportunities where they come along, FDIC or otherwise, payments businesses, corporate trust opportunities. The stuff you've seen us do over the last 4 years, 5 years. We see a pipeline for that opportunity. And as Andy said, we have plenty of room left within our retained capital to do that.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And just a follow-up on the Corporate Trust. I mean, there've been some recent lawsuits looking at the questions around the trustees' responsibility as -- in some of the sub-prime securitizations. Do you have kind of any thoughts on -- as to how that might shake out?","Richard K. Davis","Yes, absolutely. I'm glad you brought it up. And as you know, it's not new. We've been dealing with this for as long as I've been here. One of the benefits of Corporate Trust is it's a really good business, particularly when the market is strong. It's a good relationship and fee business, and it provides -- there's pretty high cost of entry. So you're either in it and you're good or you're not in it at all. We've got the benefit of being in it and good. But with it comes the risk of confusion, and it's a reputation risk that we manage every single day. And it can be anything from foreclosed properties, where we are often cited as the owner of the property, or REO property, where there's some problem with the quality of the structure, and we're identified as the owner. And it turns out we're most often the trustee. And in fact, that causes people to be confused because that's still a complicated topic. When a company might file bankruptcy and we're acting as trustee, it looks like we were the lender who put them into a bankruptcy. And then more times than not, as you're talking about now in some of the MBS and other kinds of structured deals, we are often hired in as the appropriate legal source and the broker between 2 parties and often confused as the party in between. So we will deal with that confusion because the business is so good, and it has such a great upside potential and we're so deep into it. We just recognize it's something we have to manage. And each time we get a chance to clarify and educate either for us or civic leaders who are confused about it, we find an opportunity to do so. But it will take quite a while for people to understand what trustee looks like. I'll close and give you my pseudo-legal point though, that as a trustee, we don't have the rights to reach in and touch the properties or change the rules of the engagement on the escrow. It's our responsibility to execute as the law would have us and to do that within the bounds of whatever the construct of the trustee relationship is. It's not ours to overreach or to step in and fix something we weren't asked to do, despite the temptation by, sometimes, people who want us to do that. So we'll deal with the confusion. And the more times people give us a chance to clarify, the more times we'll take it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","You've obviously been outgrowing the industry in the loans. You've talked about some NIM pressure going forward. When you put it all together, do you think you can still grow net interest income dollars from here?","Andrew Cecere","I think the short answer to that, Matt, is yes. So our NIM pressure was principally related to our increase in our securities portfolio, and that's true on a year-over-year as well as linked quarter basis. We took advantage of our long cash position this quarter to accelerate some of our purchases. But I think we're going to remain fairly stable in that securities portfolio going forward. And we have a good amount of debt at higher costs rolling off in the second half of the year, so that'll create some stabilization. As I mentioned, I expect us to be down a few basis points in the second quarter, but then I expect some stabilization.","Richard K. Davis","Let me also add, Matt, that I know this would be the case for everybody. But as well as we're doing on loan growth, we're doing even better in commitment growth. And while that doesn't show up in the balance sheet, it shows up in the future. And I think you're all going to be very pleased that whenever the robust economy comes back, and it will, we're going to stand to enjoy a second round of, I think, a comparative benefit because the commitment growth is so significant and yet to be tapped because utilization stays flat. We're actually quite optimistic that to answer your question with a strong yes.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then separate topic, in terms of buybacks and just capital return overall. Not that I'm looking for a specific price in which you'd be buying back stock but you have had some banks come out and say, \"We'll be aggressive buyers up to here.\" And I'm just wondering conceptually, one, how you think about valuation? And then two, one could make the argument that maybe special dividends, over time, might make more sense. So how do you just think about balancing that over time?","Andrew Cecere","Yes. Matt, this is Andy. As you know, the trade-off with the buyback is buying back the stock at times 0, or the cash flows at times 0 plus 1 and forward. And we do have a specific view on that. We look at that every month in the perspective of our company. And we have a very good view on the future. At this price, we are still buying back our stock. And there is a price well above the level we are at today that we would have consideration about holding back a bit, but we're not to that level now. So we're very comfortable buying back at today's price. We're also comfortable with the balance between dividends and buybacks, because it gives us the opportunity to move in terms of buybacks up or down, give other opportunities in the marketplace that we talked about before.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Penala with BofA Merrill Lynch.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question is on home equity classification on the credit side. I know this is a much smaller piece of your pie, but we saw from larger banks an increase in problem loans as they reclassified some of their seconds that are still paying as the first is in trouble. Did you stick to that cost, or did you also stick to that same classification this quarter? Or is that already reflected in your numbers?","Richard K. Davis","Erika, I'm going to have Bill answer the technical issue. But for us, I just want to highlight, it is very, very small, and the numbers that you've seen from some of the larger banks are significantly greater than. So for us, we're talking $15 million to $30 million, well below the $1 billion-plus that you've seen elsewhere. And so for us, we believe that the classification we have today is accurate and reflects appropriately, and we did do some actions last quarter that Bill can talk about. But I'll also say that if we discover that there's a prevailing view on how things should be handled, then we can do that. But if you look at our nonperforming loans, they improved by almost 8% linked quarter. If we were taking that $15 million to $30 million, they would've improved by 7%. So just to reiterate, the immateriality of it and the fact that it's not a big number is important for me to highlight. And, Bill, you might talk a little deeper dive.","P. W. Parker","Yes. So I mean, if -- our home equity portfolio has 2 distinguishing features. One, a lot of it is -- about $5 billion of it is actually lines that are in the first lien position, so there's not even another loan to look at, so obviously, that's very high quality. And then those that we do service, about 30% of the portfolio, that's where that $15 million, $30 million comes from. So it's just not a material number. The other part of what that reclassification was about was really on the reserving side, and that's, I'd argue, the more important side. And we'd implemented that sometime last year. So we feel very comfortable with the adequacy of our reserves on home equity.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just to veer into another topic. Richard, could you give us a sense or an update on your ability to reprice the deposit product in 2012 on the retail side? I know a lot of banks had talked about mitigation efforts sort of in the first half of last year in anticipation of debit interchange reform. And just wanted to get a sense on how some of the fee transfer to the consumer is panning out this year.","Richard K. Davis","Erika, we've said that of the total loss of revenue that was derived by CARD Act, Reg E and Durbin, that we would eventually get to 50% of that back. And I think we said we were at 30% last time. Our plan is to get to that 50% by year's end, and I also said it won't be before year's end because we're going to be very thoughtful about this. But I'm comfortable we can do it. And in doing so, there's a couple things. One is market share gain really helps a lot. You can improve your fee revenue by just having more customers who are paying the current fees that you offer and feel good about that, with our Checking With Choice and some of the way we packaged our products, people are seemingly happy to pay those fees and get the services we provide, especially some of the things we're adding to the capabilities, like mobile and more technology. I would say, however, there will also be some increases in certain fee categories that we will continue to provide because we need to do that to return to the shareholders what they've been waiting for. But we had to be very thoughtful about market positions, and we are not a one-size-fits-all. We have basically business in every state. We have 25 states where our consumer business is located. And if we have to have 168 different solutions for that many different pricing markets, which is how many we have, we would do that. So we're going to be very careful and thoughtful and look at where the market competition will allow us to increase the current fees. And we're really going to go after with some market share grab and competing to have more customers that pay what we think is a fair assessment for the service we provide. Nothing magic. And what I did say is we will get to that 50%. We'll use the whole year to get there. I'm not rushing it. We've got a good momentum everywhere else. And I'm not going to mess up what's happening right now and the good momentum we have in the branches where they're getting more customers, deeper relationships and not putting them through the fits and starts of having to decide what prices we change all the time, because we're very consistent and I wanted to give them that benefit.","Operator","Your next question comes from John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just a broader question. You guys are executing well. Your profitability ratio is within the targeted ranges. Kind of wondering where do you think you're still under-earning, whether it's low interest rates or mitigating some of the reg reform, where are areas that you can improve the profitability over the next couple years?","Richard K. Davis","Well, the best part of the story, and I mean, the best part of the story is that we're just so not finished getting great at what we already do. So hard as it is to talk about organic growth and pursuit of investments from prior periods, that's really what the story is all about. And in fact, John, the recent quarter 1 2012 was as good as it was, was because of things we did in third quarter 2010 and the commitments we're making through employee engagement and technology. So I would tell you, we hit our peak in capital investments in 2010, but we'll have to continue to work that off. Our investments in the first 5 years of 2001 to 2006 were 45% less than they were in the last 5 years of 2006 to 2011. So we've spent quite a bit of money, with your all's knowledge and permission, to reinvest in the company, and that's starting to show up in capital. Acquisitions are all accretive, most of the time on day 1, and I think those continue to show as beneficial. But this last part is organic growth. And I know it's so unexciting to talk about, but it's exactly what's happening here. And so from Wealth Management building out to become a national first-class wealth manager, to adding our new Ascent ultra-high net worth business, which is only a couple of quarters old, to this amazing buildout you've seen us take to a national level on our Corporate Banking capabilities and then adding our payment skills across the globe and our consumer retail bank and small business now taking altogether new levels of performance. Add it all up, and that's what you get. So I think on top of that, a stock market that's actually, at best, kind of flattish and interest rates, which we all know are as low as they're going to be, we've got upside on every single cylinder. And if this is an 8-cylinder car, we're running at about 4.5 right now. So if you like what you see now, just wait until things start getting better. I think there's nothing but upward bias toward what we can do the old-fashion organic way.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Richard, that's helpful. Maybe a question for Bill. Where are you on the kind of cycle of reserve release, and how do you see that playing out over the next couple quarters? And then also, if you could just comment, what drove the higher reserve build for the rep in warranty? Is that due to higher origination volume or something else?","P. W. Parker","Yes. So the reserve release, I mean, we're in the point of the credit cycle where we'll continue to get credit improvement, probably for another 18 months. We have Commercial Real Estate assets that still need to be resolved, and that's going to take some time. And some of the residential mortgage portfolios are still stressed, so that's going to take time. But the improvement is slowing. I mean, some of our portfolios are performing at extremely good credit levels. Credit cards, auto's doing extremely well. So you're not going to see a lot more improvement in those areas. I think of the reserve release as something that will -- it will continue, but at a lower level. That will continue to decline.","Andrew Cecere","And, John, this is Andy. Regarding the mortgage question, the principal reason for that was the recent changes from the GSEs in terms of increasing their sampling size. So I would not expect a significantly higher quarter-to-quarter loss rate, but perhaps a longer or more extended period. And that's why we have a higher reserve level.","Richard K. Davis","And -- yes, John, let me just add because God knows I've got to speak if you guys speak. It's only fair. I want to remind you that as you saw our charge-offs hit a level of 1.09%, we've said to all of you for a long time that over the cycle, this is a probably 1% charge-off bank, especially because of our credit card size. We're hitting that 1%. We're hitting close to it, and I predict we'll go below it. And my goal is to do our best to make sure that our reserves, within accounting rules, stay to a place where we don't have to rebuild them all back later on. As an industry, I'm arguing for that as well because I think we've learned a lesson and we don't want to do that. But you have to appreciate that I think Bill and I both think that 1.09% goes to 1% and probably falls under that for a little while, not as a goal necessarily, but over the time and term of our long history, we think that we'll be at 1%, and we're getting very close to that.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then one just follow-up for Andy. To the extent there's a nuance change in the GSE sampling behavior, is that them looking at a wider range of indices, Andy, or putting -- trying to put back stuff that's been paying for longer? Any color on that?","Andrew Cecere","It's just, John, just going deeper in the loans that we're looking at and going back further. So it's deeper and further in terms of the sampling size. And there's going to be -- the more you look at, the more you may find, and that's why we increased the reserve.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ed Najarian with ISI Group.","Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Question sort of asked, but maybe I'll ask in a slightly different way. So you're 109 basis points on the charge-off ratio this quarter and have given that long-term guidance of 1%. Richard, you've said in prior calls you expected to dip below that 1% level. That sort of looks likely now for next year. Any thoughts as to how far you might dip below that level as you sort of continue to clean up credit and we see this big decline that we're seeing now again this quarter in the delinquency trends? I mean, could we go down to 70 or 80 basis points at some point?","Richard K. Davis","Yes, yes. I mean, Ed, I don't know where we end up. When I say under 1%, I just want you all to know that it's probably going to be -- it's going to overperform for a little while there. It could be 90 basis points, could be high 80s. I don't know. It's not going to be 50 or anything like that. We're still making loans. We're still taking calculated risk, and you want us to do that. But we're also not -- what I'm also telegraphing to you is we're not going to start reaching into riskier categories. We're not going to start underwriting more aggressively. We're not worried about protecting our position as one of the larger market share growers in the credit. We're doing it the way we're doing it, and we're not going to change. So I'm also telegraphing to you that we're not expecting it to get so pristine that you think we're missing opportunities. But I do think this a high-quality book. The stress test would have said so each time they do it. And I think you guys should be comfortable that if we fall below 1%, it's not a goal. It happens to be an outcome. But our goal is to manage this company right around 1% because that, we think, is the right level of risk and reward.","Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then secondarily, if I add back the repurchase provision on mortgage side, I think I'm getting to a mortgage gain on sale, sort of gross number of about 230 basis points on the production. First of all, is that about -- do you agree with that? And then second of all, what are your thoughts on how long that can last or the pace that, that might decline, over what time frame? Or we all know that's a very wide number, but I think we're all struggling with how quickly and over what time frame that declines.","Andrew Cecere","Ed, so the production gain is based on net applications net of a projected fall-out number, so it's closer to 200 basis points in terms of the math. And it is wider than I would expect it to continue in forward quarters, but we are enjoying robust business in our Mortgage group as we talked about. We're taking share, and we're expanding our capabilities. So I would expect it, the second quarter, to have another strong quarter in Mortgage, and it's hard for me to see beyond that right now because there's just too much uncertainty out there.","Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","But at least for the second quarter, it looks like another quarter in terms of very wide gain on sales spread?","Andrew Cecere","Our pipelines continue to be strong. There might be some slowdowns just given the -- about 75% of our first quarter activity was refinanced activity. I would expect that to slow somewhat given that rates have stabilized, but the pipeline continues to be strong.","Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right. But that's more of a comment on volume. I'm just talking about the gain on sales spread.","Andrew Cecere","Yes, in the first few months of the quarter here, I would expect it to continue strong.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions on loans. Number one, Commercial Real Estate is an area that's started to grow again a little bit for you guys, and just wanted to understand how much of that is still moving over from the C&D book versus opportunities that you're starting to see in the marketplace? How is CRE looking as far as maybe the next part of the loan book to pick up, and where are you guys in terms of your aggressiveness in that market?","P. W. Parker","This is Bill. The -- it's not really moving over from the construction and development. That continues to decline. So the growth we've been picking up is more in stabilized properties. And they're going to be Class A properties, a lot of them with our institutional investors. We have a pretty high-quality group of clientele that our Commercial Real Estate group has enjoyed many years of performance with, and that's where we pick up the loan growth.","Richard K. Davis","Yes, in fact -- Ken, it's Richard. It's unremarkable in where it's coming from. It's remarkable it's coming from everywhere. And I think also the buildout of our Corporate Bank capabilities, as you've been hearing about for the last couple of years, make us more of a one-stop shop for some of these larger real estate national companies that have used us now for higher positions, allowed us to be in the deals longer, have used us for capital market capabilities. So for us, it's just like I said in the beginning, it's everywhere. It's a little bit of every category and I think it's the flight to quality that we continue to enjoy that I don't know how long that lasts. But every time we get to talk to you, it's still there, and we'll enjoy it until it's not.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. And my second question just relates to just loan pricing. Obviously, yields came down a little bit in both C&I and CRE. I just want -- if you had some anecdotes to share in terms of how you see loan pricing across the markets and across the commercial products.","Andrew Cecere","Yes, this is Andy. We've talked about the fact, the last few quarters, that loan spreads have stabilized. And I would say that continues to be the case in the first quarter. There are pockets of increased competition, particularly in the commercial area and maybe a little bit below that. But overall, commercial wholesale loan spreads are stable.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Miller with FBR.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I had a quick follow-up question on the pushbacks. You talked about increased sample size from the GSEs, a change in policy. Can you just add more color to that?","Andrew Cecere","I don't know how else to define it other than they're looking at more loans, both from the perspective of the depth of the categories as well as the time frame. So if they were looking at 10 loans before, they're looking at 12 now for whatever period, and that's it. So we applied a similar expectation on that increased sample size. It could be that the increased sample size will result in actually a lower loss expectation. We just don't know until we get through the data.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then on the loan portfolio, which has grown very nicely for you guys. But one of the areas that has grown is residential, and I think part of that's probably because or your market share increase in the Mortgage Banking space. Is that mainly jumbo loans, or is any of that 30-year conforming product?","P. W. Parker","Yes. There's definitely jumbos; that primarily come through our private client channels. So we do book those jumbo loans that are not GSE qualified. And then the other area of origination is out of our branches, and we have -- it's a refi product only. Average loan size is less than $100,000. These are low loan-to-value first-mortgage refinance originations out of our branch. So those are the 2 main categories.","Andrew Cecere","And those are likely to have a life of 10 to 15 years. Schedule of 10 to 15 versus 30 years.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And what type of yield?","Andrew Cecere","The spreads on those are probably 50 to 75 basis points above what you might expect from a GSE qualified.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then one last question on HARP. I know there's been a lot of media reports, and we've been publishing a lot of stuff about how HARP is better than expectations. And as April 1, I believe, banks like you can start to pick at other servicing portfolios with somewhat limited reps and warrants. I just wondered, are you going to continue to try take market share and maybe go after some of these loans and other portfolios?","P. W. Parker","Well, we'll -- first of all, I'll just comment that our HARP volume has been pretty strong. We had about a 47% application increase quarter-over-quarter, so we have seen a good HARP refi production. Hard to say how aggressive we'll be on going after the other people's business. I mean, we've been very active in our own portfolio, and we'll continue to be active on our own portfolio. That's our first priority.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Just to follow up on Ed's earlier question. So what -- if you're 200 basis point mortgage gain on sale now, what would be typical? And again, why is it greater than average? And it's not just you. It's the whole industry.","Andrew Cecere","Typical, Mike, would be somewhere between 125 and 125 (sic) [150]. It's higher right now because there's so much demand in the marketplace, and there's a fairly long -- healthy pipeline. And the number of suppliers in the marketplace is down. So it's just a function of supply and demand in the current market, and that gives us some pricing opportunity.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And did you mean 125 to 150 is normal?","Andrew Cecere","Yes, correct.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And who are you getting share from in your pursuit to be the top 5?","Richard K. Davis","Well, we're already there actually. I was just being generous. We're taking it from the large -- some of the larger guys ahead of us. There's a couple of large banks that are backing it down on that business and just not putting their energy into resources. And then on the other side, there are some smaller partners that are getting out of the business and looking like they're trading. So it's exactly what you see, Mike. I don't have to name names, but you know who's in it big and who's growing and you know who's either backing down or not very present. And we're getting it from there.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then switching to your Corporate Banking buildout which you've talked a lot about. But when I look linked quarter, period-end commercial loans without commercial leases are up 18% annualized. And we can look at average, and average is up 15% annualized. However, you want to slice that, that's a big number. And my question relates to how much of that growth is due to syndicated lending, and how much of that growth is due to purchases of loans?","P. W. Parker","Well, we are -- I mean, in the large corporate space, you're going to be active in the syndicated market, and that complements our corporate bond issuance area. So that is a piece of it, but we're also active in the middle market. So our middle market group is included in those statistics. We have a ABL unit that's enjoyed nice growth. So it's really across the board.","Richard K. Davis","And, Mike, we haven't done much to buy. We're not big acquirers of somebody else's loans. There've been a couple of deals we've looked at. We pass on almost everything that you see in the public market. And if there's a deal, we'll cherry-pick a loan or 2. It'll have to mostly be a customer we already know and just a position and a hold level we're willing to take, but it's not a growth strategy for us to go acquire portfolios. If they come along, we'll look at everything, but we are not as hungry for some of those deals as some others are.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then lastly, as you pointed out, your profitability ratios are within your targeted range. But are you leaving money on the table by not having a greater variety of capital market features to give your clients, especially with your Corporate Banking buildout?","Richard K. Davis","O-M-G, no. And I say that because we like -- we only do what we understand and that we can control. And as trite as it sounds, I really like the consistent, predictable, repeatable business we've given you all. I thought you were going to ask if we're going to stop at 16 and 1.6, and that would be no way either. Are you kidding? But we love what we are because I think you can count on it and you can -- it's an annuity. And you can watch it grow, and you can watch it adjust if you don't see any big surprises. And adding to some of those additional opportunities are not hurting us at all because we've got all the ones we wanted to in the last few years by building out our Wholesale Bank and capital markets, nothing left we covet. There's nothing we don't have that we want, and there's nothing we have now that we don't want to keep. So what you see is what you're going to get for quite a while.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nancy Bush with NAB Research.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","Richard, a question for you. We still are yet to find out about the G-SIFI. We kind of know what it is, but not really. Volcker is yet to come. Are there any other major regulatory pieces outside whatever the CFPB may do that we're waiting for?","Andrew Cecere","Nancy, this is Andy. Only one I -- that I know we're all watching is the final LCR ratio. There's a definition out there today. I know there's some discussion occurring with Basel and the Fed in terms of potential adjustments to that. We've built a lot of liquidity on balance sheet. And whatever those final ratios are will guide us to whatever we finalize from the securities portfolio, but that would be the only other one I could think of.","Richard K. Davis","Yes. Nancy, I was about to say, \"No, I don't think so.\" And then I'm getting the eye cross from Andy like, we have one thing. But let me say what I would characterize. Between Volcker, Dodd-Frank, CFPB, as it relates to the financial impacts to our company and to shareholders, substantially, most of that has already been seen by those other activities of Reg E and Durbin and CARD Act and things like that. Now it'll change the course of how we run the company because we'll have to maybe dot our i's and cross our t's twice. We'll have to confirm certain behaviors. We built our capital markets business knowing that the Volcker Rules were going to change. Dodd-Frank, at just probably 65% of Dodd-Frank will touch our company, and the big majority of it's going to be more paperwork transactions and managing the details, but not the financials. And CFPB, I remain optimistic that it hasn't done anything I haven't seen yet to argue with, and we'll watch and see to see how they perform. But I think if their original true goal of being transparent, clear and helping customers understand what they bought, we're going to be in great shape there. If they get into things like price fixing and things like that, then we'll deal with that when we face it. And it'll affect everybody, and as usual, probably affect us a lot. But for now, I think, we're, as a management team, keeping our eye on so many things but not sitting here worrying about the peril that it will create for the investment that you guys have in our company. And if it's a deal, we'll manage it like we have before and we'll find an offset.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","So you think the regulatory regime, as we see it right now, is pretty much what we get going forward?","Richard K. Davis","Well, I think the details are -- yes, I've got the canvas. I've seen the paint on the side, but no one's has painted it yet. But I mean, I don't think there's a hidden trap door that -- of any significance that we can't at least predict or work within as the next couple of years go forward. But as you know, I mean, Dodd-Frank's only 25%, 33% done. Volcker's got a lot of TBDs, and CFPB is new. So I'm not saying it's at all known or done, but I'm telling you what I think. Its worst-case scenarios are something we can manage.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","And, Richard, would you care to make an intrepid prediction about when you might get the ability to make or to decide capital actions without going through the CCAR, et cetera, et cetera? I mean, are we at a point now over the next several years where capital actions are done once a year based upon the results of the CCAR, or is that going to change?","Richard K. Davis","Yes, Nancy, I really don't have any facts around it to offer. But I would say we're going to learn a couple things this year, because we know there are a couple of our peers that are seeking midyear capital actions based on what they didn't get in the CCAR. And I think that will inform all of us because we have no evidence that it will be anything less than an annual activity. And then I also am betting that it will take a few more years, few meaning more than 1 or 2, for the global regulators to believe that banks can manage themselves without oversight. But I think the stress test is an annual event that makes sense. And as long as the rules are understood and we know how to participate in predicting our own outcome and make our own decisions that are hopefully approved, I don't think it becomes a burden all but one that we all just have an extra step than we had before. But I think in terms of annual nature, I think we're about to learn that this year some of our folks have -- for a midyear correction.","Operator","Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a quick question on the commitments. You called out the 5% q-on-q growth in CRE and C&I. I'm just wondering, you've been having nice commitment growth for a while now. How long does the commitments take to translate into outstandings?","Richard K. Davis","Well, currently, forever. I mean, really, our commitment levels, just to give you an idea, when I give you 25%, this is for the large corporate and middle market clients. So it's not credit card. It's not consumer. It's not even small business. Back in 2009, that was 37%, right. So 37% of $65 million was used as a line of credit. Last quarter, we have 25% of $90 billion. So while the growth -- the actual loans outstanding are virtually flat, the increase in the outstandings open to buy is remarkable. So I got to tell you, in a recession, it really is. I have no idea how long it will take. But what I know is when it happens, it'll be amazingly quick. And you guys can watch us like a Doppler radar. The first thing that happens when companies start getting ready to move is the cash balances get used. And then the line of credit gets used and then new loans are made. And so we are still at record levels of deposit held based on companies being strong enough right now and kind of husbanding cash until they know what to do with it. And that's the first, I think, canary in the mine that says, no one's actually taking any big steps at this point in time. But they are getting those lines of credit, Betsy. And they're planning to use them, I suspect, because they're paying for them, and it gives them a lot of alternatives. And I think the country's business community is much stronger than people think it is because they are cash rich. They are line of credit capable, and they're ready to jump when something comes along. We just need that trigger event, and I don't see it on the near term, but surely it will happen because of the cycle.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. I see the macro numbers in your release. I just wondered if you, in tracking individual companies that you're extending commitments to, is that translating into loan growth at all over the last year or so? And I guess your answer is not yet.","Richard K. Davis","Yes. Not yet. And it's a great question because if I -- I would tell you, if that 25% was a few companies that are 100% and the rest at 0, that would be information. But it's not. It's the average company has a line of credit and uses a part of it, and then the rest they leave open to buy. And so for us, this represents a behavior, a consistency, but an absolute growth opportunity.","Operator","Your next question comes from Greg Ketron from UBS.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. One, the of course, commercial loan growth has continued at a very impressive pace, and maybe some color -- it looks like you would be getting market share, and maybe some color on the strategies that you're undertaking to approach the wholesale or commercial lending business.","Richard K. Davis","Sure. This is Richard. Warning, here comes something else that sounds not that exciting. We work on advocacy. And we've been training all of our lenders, many of whom have been doing this for 30 years, on a special training program we created here in our company on customer advocacy. And that is, Greg, code word for building deeper relationships and having the entire company available informationally to a customer when we meet with them. So we're not -- we don't have the relationship manager now calling on a line of credit, talking about line of credit, praying for a line of credit and coming back home. This relationship manager is working with an entire team doing pre-call activities, bringing the right people out to the client, selling the entire company, if not now, later, and getting a lot of market from other places. So the relationship depth we have is intensely higher than it was before. And to answer a question about 45 minutes ago, amazingly still, an infant in its growth opportunity. So what we're doing now is just getting started on a new way of taking market share. Our guys figured out that flight to quality is a real deal. It translates to new business. So telling the story better helps us do a better job. And so it's really training and making the entire company available through every relationship manager. See, I told you it wasn't going to sound exciting. But I'll tell you what, it's a big deal and it's a big change from where we were a few years ago.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","This has legs that could run for beyond next couple of quarters if it's...","Richard K. Davis","That's right. This has years of legs because it's got nothing but upside. And again, if you like what you see now, just imagine what we can do when we really get good at it.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And, Andy, a question for you on the margin. On the liability side, what remaining opportunities do you have, such as may be debt restructuring or elimination, that may help support the margin through the rest of this year?","Andrew Cecere","We have some TGLP paper coming off here in the May-June time frame. And then in total, if you think about the second half of the year, another $7 billion to $9 billion of higher-cost debt rolling off, some of which will be replaced, some of which will be sort of re-substituted with deposit growth that we're enjoying. So that benefit will start to show in the margin in the second half.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So you'll see your cost come out of debt that will be replaced with lower-cost funding sources?","Andrew Cecere","Correct.","Operator","Our final question comes from Chris Gamaitoni with Compass Point.","Christopher Gamaitoni - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","I just had 2 questions, one around deposits. Noninterest-bearing deposits looked like they decline about 5% quarter-over-quarter and that looks to be mostly in the community bank, small community bank segment. Can you just give a little color on that? Is that people becoming more comfortable and willing to spend and thinking about their current position?","Andrew Cecere","I would attribute more of it to seasonality, typical seasonality related to tax activity and just first quarter spend. So I don't think there's so much of a decline or utilization as much as the seasonal impacts.","Christopher Gamaitoni - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the deposit service accounts charges, they were down 10%, 10.5% quarter-over-quarter. It was attributed to seasonality. I haven't seen the same trends across other banks. Is there a geography issue or a business change that's impacting that?","Andrew Cecere","There is no geography issue. There are fewer days, business days, in the first quarter than the fourth quarter, and that's the principal reason for the decline and the key driver of that number.","Christopher Gamaitoni - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just to clarify a statement. You talked about a significant increase in HARP volume. Was that HARP 1.0 or was that HARP 2.0?","P. W. Parker","We implemented 2.0 in the first quarter, so it'll be some of both.","Operator","I will now turn the conference back to Mr. Davis for closing remarks.","Richard K. Davis","Well, obviously, thank you, guys, for your continued support. The questions were great, and they helped us clarify what's on your mind. I'd also ask you to remain optimistic about this economy. I mean, it's starting to show some real signs of permanent but slow recovery. And we're going to be watching every step of it and being engaged in part of it. And hopefully, the banks in America will get a little more credit for the kind of good work we're going do to help get America back on its feet. So spread the good word. That's what I would say, and thanks for your interest in our company.","Judith T. Murphy","Yes. Thank you, all, for listening.

Following the review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Rogers, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon, Eastern through Friday, January 22nd at 12 Midnight, Eastern Time.","I will now turn the conference call over to Bob Kleiber of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.","Bob Kleiber","Thank you, Maria, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Kathy Rogers, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are joining me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2015 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Kathy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules, are available on our Web site at usbank.com.","I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today\u2019s presentation, in our press release, and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Richard.","Richard Davis","Thank you, Bob. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I will begin our report with a few highlights from U.S. Banc\u2019s 2015 full year results on Page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bancorp reported record net income of $5.9 billion or $3.16 per diluted common share. We achieved industry-leading profitability with the return on average assets of 1.44%, a return on average common equity of 14%, and an efficiency ratio of 53.8% for the year. Total average loans grew by 4.1% adjusted for student loans and average deposits grew a strong 7.7% year-over-year. Credit quality continue to improve with the 12.1% of decline in net charge-offs and a 15.8% decrease in non-performing assets. Our capital position remains strong and we returned $4 billion or 72% of our earnings to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks during 2015.","Turning to Slide 4 and our quarterly highlights, U.S. Banc reported record revenue of $5.2 billion and net income of $1.5 billion or $0.80 per diluted common share, an increase of 1.3% year-over-year. The fourth quarter of 2015 included a gain from the sale of an HSA account deposit portfolio with diluted earnings per share up by $0.1. I am very pleased this quarter with the momentum in our linked quarter loan growth, the continued strength of our payments business and the improvement in our operating leverage.","Total average loans grew 1.7% linked quarter adjusted for student loans, which exceeded the high-end of our 1% to 1.5% range. In addition, we continue to see strong growth in average deposits which included consumer net new account growth of 3.2%. Credit quality continued to remain strong. Total net charge-offs and non-performing assets declined on a year-over-year basis and non-performing assets declined on a linked quarter basis as well. Slide 5 provides you with the five quarter history of our performance metrics and they remain among the best in the industry.","Moving to the graph on the right, you can see that this quarter\u2019s net interest margin of 3.06% was relatively stable as expected, improving 2 basis points from the third quarter. This was primarily driven by a higher loan growth which reduced the amount of cash balances. Our efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 53.9%. We expect this ratio to remain in the low 50s going forward as we continue to see the results of our expanded efficiency effort that we introduced last year, which includes prudent FTE management and a renewed emphasis on other discretionary spending. As I said earlier, I am particularly pleased that we were able to achieve positive operating leverage for the quarter which reverses a trend of negative leverage over the past several quarters. I believe this positions us well as we move into 2016.","While prudent expense management remains a priority for our company, we also continue to focus on revenue growth and innovation, which means investing in those businesses and products that will provide strong returns. During the quarter, we announced a new agreement with Fidelity Investments. U.S. Banc is now the exclusive issuer of the Fidelity Investments\u2019 rewards card program. As part of this arrangement which closed at the end of 2015, we purchased the existing card portfolio of $1.6 billion. This follows the announcement from last October about our card issuing partnership with the Auto Club Trust and the purchase of an existing $500 million portfolio. These agreements exemplify the strength of our payments business model and a continued commitment to strategic growth for our Company.","Turning to Slide 6, the company reported record net revenue in the fourth quarter of $5.2 billion, a 0.8% increase from the prior year which included core revenue growth and a gain on the sales of the HSA deposit portfolio, partially offset by the Nuveen gain recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014. The revenue momentum we are seeing is primarily due to our growing balance sheet and growth in the number of our fee based businesses including our payments and trust businesses.","Kathy will now give you a few more details about our fourth quarter results.","Kathy Rogers","Thanks Richard. The average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 7. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $10 billion or 4.2% year-over-year and 1.7% linked quarter adjusted for student loans. As you may recall we moved our student loan portfolio to held-for-sale in the first quarter of 2015 and subsequently retuned it to held-for-investment during the third quarter.","In the fourth quarter, the increase in average loans outstanding on a year-over-year basis was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 9% and 2.5% linked quarter. The strongest linked growth I've seen in 2015. Line utilization however remained relatively consistent with the previous quarter and flat year-over-year. Consumer loans again showed positive momentums lead by credit card and auto loans. Average auto credit cards increased 4.7% year-over-year and 5% on a linked quarter basis, which included the acquisition of approximately $500 million Auto Club portfolio at the end of quarter three. Auto loan growth remains strong up 13% year-over-year and 2% linked quarter.","Residential mortgages grew 2.1% year-over-year reversing a declining trend over the last several quarters and rose 2.2% on a linked quarter basis. We currently expect total average linked quarter loan growth to be in the 1% to 1.5% range in quarter one. Total average deposits increased $19 billion or 6.9% over the same quarter of last year and 1.7% on a linked quarter basis. Growth in non-interest bearing and low interest checking, money market and saving deposits remained strong on a year-over-year basis, and continue to more than offset the run-off of maturing larger dollar time deposits.","Turning to Slide 8 and credit quality, total net charge-offs declined 1% on a year-over-year basis and increased 4.5% on a linked quarter basis primarily due to lower recoveries. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 47 basis points in the fourth quarter, a slight increase over the third quarter. Non-performing assets decreased by 2.8% on a linked quarter basis and 15.8% over the fourth quarter of 2014. The fourth quarter provision for credit losses was equal to net charge-offs which compares to a release of reserves of $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $10 million in the third quarter of 2015. As we move into 2016, we would expect that reserves will begin to build the support loan growth. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect net charge-offs and total non-performing assets to remain relatively stable in the first quarter of 2016.","Slide 9 gives a view of our fourth quarter and full year of 2015 results versus comparable time periods. As I mentioned, our diluted EPS of $0.80 includes $0.01 related to net impact of the sale of our HSA deposit portfolio partially offset by accruals related to the legal and compliance matters. Fourth quarter net income decreased 12 million or 0.8% year-over-year, this is principally due to a higher provision for credit losses, increase in net interest income primarily driven by growth in earnings assets, lower non-interest income impacted by the 2014 Nuveen gain, partially offset by increases in payments related revenue, trust and investment management fees and the HSA deposit sale gain. On a linked quarter basis, net income was lower by $13 million or 0.9% mainly due to predicted seasonal increase in non-interest expense and an increase in the provision for credit losses partially offset by higher net revenue primarily due to loan growth.","Turning to Slide 10, net interest income increased year-over-year by $72 million or 2.6%. The increase was the result of growth in average earning assets of 5.1% partially offset by a lower net interest margin. The net interest margin of 3.06% was 8 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2014. The decline was primarily due to a change in loan portfolio mix, as well as the growth in the investment portfolio at lower average rates and lower reinvestment rates. Net interest income increased $50 million on a linked quarter basis, primarily due to higher average total loans. The net interest margin of 3.06% was 2 basis points higher than the third quarter. The increase in the net interest margin was principally due to higher loan growth which resulted in lower cash balances. We currently expect that the net interest margin will be relatively stable in the first quarter.","Slide 11 highlights non-interest income which decreased $30 million or 1.3% year-over-year. The year-over-year decrease in non-interest income was primarily due to the impact of the 2014 Nuveen gain partially offset by fee revenue growth and the HSA deposit share gain. Higher credit and debit card revenue, trust and investment management fees and merchant processing services were partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue primarily due to an unfavorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights net of hedging activities.","Momentum in our payment businesses was reflected in our fourth quarter results. Credit and debit card fees grew 8.1% on a year-over-year basis, principally driven by higher volumes which were up 6% compared to 5.3% in quarter three. Merchant processing revenue increased 2.3% year-over-year, and approximately 6.5% excluding the impact of foreign currency rate changes. The growth was driven by higher transaction volumes, account growth and equipment sales to merchants related to new chip card technology requirements. These equipment sales were modestly lower than the amount recognized in quarter three as expected.","On a linked quarter basis, non-interest income was higher by $14 million or 0.6% principally due to seasonally higher credit and debit card revenue and the HSA deposit sale gain partially offset by lower corporate payment product revenue reflecting the seasonally higher quarter three government related transaction volume. Mortgage banking revenue was also lower as expected primarily due to seasonally lower origination revenue. We would expect that fee revenue in quarter one will be seasonally lower on a linked quarter basis.","Moving to Slide 12, non-interest expense was essentially flat year-over-year. Higher compensation expense which reflected the impact of merit increases and higher staffing for risk and compliance activity, along with higher employee benefit expense driven by pension cost were largely offset by lower marketing and business development expenses, principally due to charitable contributions recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014 and lower other expense reflecting a net year-over-year impact of legal accruals. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense increased $34 million or 1.2% as predicted reflecting seasonally higher costs related to investments and tax advantage projects and accruals related to legal and compliance matters, partially offset by the favorable impact of reduced mortgage related compliance and talent upgrade costs which were elevated in quarter three and declined as expected in quarter four.","Compensation expense declined reflecting the impact of expense management initiatives and declines in variable compensation. Employee benefits expense also declined driven by lower payroll tax expense and healthcare costs. We would expect expenses to be relatively stable in quarter one compared quarter four, seasonally higher benefits expense will be offset by seasonally lower tax credit amortization and the impact of the credit card portfolio acquisition.","Turning to Slide 13, as Richard mentioned our capital position remains strong. We returned 61% of our earnings to shareholders during the quarter. Dividends accounted for 32% while stock repurchases accounted for the remaining 29%. For the full year, we returned 72% of our earnings to shareholders and we expect to remain in our 60% to 80% range going forward. Our common equity tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as is fully implemented at December 31st was 9.1% which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our intangible book value per share rose to 17.44 at December 31st representing a 9.3% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 1.4% increase over the prior quarter.","I will now turn the call back to Richard.","Richard Davis","Thanks, Kathy. I\u2019m proud of our fourth quarter and full year results. We reported record full year net income and record revenue for the quarter. We remained industry leading performance measures and reported a $0.19 return on tangible common equity in the quarter. We delivered on our promise to work toward positive operating leverage with the efforts that we've made through our efficiency program. And we continue to make strategic investments in our businesses and focus on innovation for the benefit of our customers.","As we look at 2016 we start the year from a position of strength as we continue to build revenue momentum, thoughtfully manage expenses, work diligently to exceed customer expectations and to create value for our shareholders in a competitive marketplace. We remain focused on delivering consistent, predictable, and repeatable financial results for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our communities and our shareholders.","That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Kathy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer your questions.","Bob Kleiber","Maria we can go ahead now and open for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets.","Jon Arfstrom","Richard, maybe a question for you on just winding and your overall move, obviously pretty negatives some of the global macro stuff that we're seeing but at the same time you've held your growth guidance, your typical growth trends you are actually come in a bit ahead of that. So, maybe if you could just step back and give us a bit of the state of the union of winding and how you're feeling about the economy and I guess I'm also curious in terms what you're seeing from the consumer in terms of their all time loan demand there?","Richard Davis","First of all, I have predicted that question, I was thinking of it this morning, but a club with American bank, we do primarily business in the domestic United States and we're very much a consumer small business payments kind of a company, so just by what is going on in the backdrop around the world with the China re-evaluation and what's happening in oil and some of those areas which we\u2019re not immune to balances and process, we're not seeing the majority of that on our books or by our customers.","So, we're actually seeing a continued steady, I'll say slow but steady improvement every quarter and our customers are reflecting that across the board from the large corporate customers, who are still doing robust M&A transactions to restructuring the portfolio, all the way down to the small businesses which continue to grow for us double-digits based on their interest and setting themselves up for our better consumer wide recovery and just general people who are using banks for their retail services. So, I am quite optimistic against that negative backdrop and I know we won\u2019t be immune to all of that. But based on our geography, based on our mix of business, based on our history, and based on our appetite for risk I think we\u2019re actually fairly immune from most of those issues at this stage, and yet we trespassed for the worst scenarios that would of course affect us.","So I would say the across the board from a lending perspective that same range you see in the 1% and 1.5% we\u2019re predicting again for this quarter already off to a really nice start and we\u2019re not seeing any disruption neither from the 25 basis point increase which we knew would be more symbolic and actually not yet from the impacts of the stock market of the China re-evaluation. So at this point we\u2019re remaining optimistic and have cautious and careful way.","Jon Arfstrom","And then is Bill Parker there?","Richard Davis","Bill is here, here you go.","Bill Parker","Yes hi John.","Jon Arfstrom","Hey Bill. Anything to add in terms of from a credit perspective and the cash you talked about the reserve releases are over and you\u2019ve all been very transparent on that. But anything from a credit perspective that\u2019s making you a bit more nervous so that is a change maybe compared to a quarter or two ago?","Bill Parker","Yes Jon first I\u2019d direct you to the dependency slide and you can look through those. And if you look at of the portfolios if you see sort of year-over-year delinquency patterns are either stable or better than last year. So, overall, very strong of course the one exception is energy and some of the metals and mining related credit. We do have that small energy portfolio of 1.2% of our total loans. So I\u2019d just say we have seen some downgrades there and we\u2019ve been building our allocated reserves for that all year long. But we built that at low 30s price of oil. So we feel like we\u2019re good for now but we\u2019ll see where oil settles down, but either way that\u2019s not going to have a material impact on kind of the overall go forward credit performance.","Jon Arfstrom","And in terms of the way we see things just the assumptions should be maybe go right pass back up in terms of the provision over charge offs just building for loan growth. Is that how we should approach it?","Bill Parker","Yes, exactly, yes.","Richard Davis","I would still jump in there Jon it is the old fashioned days where you\u2019re supposed to provide for the next new loan right and I think we\u2019re at that inflection point. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll start moving up very quickly because we\u2019re settling here at that turning point of no provision. But we don\u2019t see anything in the near-term that\u2019s going to harm that and I want to pick up on energy and metals and mining. We do stress test our portfolios routinely and not just for those particular categories but tangent effects it might have on other parts of our customers and portfolios and in certain geographies. And as Bill mentioned we\u2019ve increased the reserve levels for both of those categories and continue to have the room and the expectation if we need to do more we can.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","When we last spoke Richard I think you were fairly optimistic about your prospects for 2016, and I think we talked about the concept of USB being a maximized franchise. As we think about building revenue momentum, slow but steady into 2016, could you give us sort of what the top-three drivers are in terms of what could drive year-over-year of improvement in revenue outside of, of course? And any more increases on the short-end?","Richard Davis","Yes, sure I will, actually I asked her more than the question, as I think I also mentioned when you and I have the fire side chat, I might add without the fireplace. You\u2019re talking about what kind of assumptions we would in our plan, and we actually expected to have two rate increases from the last time I talked to you. We hope for one in December, we expect a one in June. And that is really the amount of the risk we have placed into our plan this year so when we\u2019re halfway with one of them at least at this point if it's fixed. So that alone does actually help us. So we\u2019re not relying on that to the very point you made.","The most important thing that happened to us is just a continued improve recovering economy where people feel they can consume, people feel they don\u2019t have to save quite as much and that they\u2019ve got a higher backstop and either in their own statements account or in their home equity or in their own debt positions where they can start spending money and feel more comfortable about it, that\u2019s going to be huge for us. That\u2019s way more important than any interest rate because as I said earlier, we\u2019re a consumer middle market wholesale bank and those sort of things that matter the most.","But I want to say the things that we could, our shoulder against to watch for improvement this year one will the continued success we\u2019re having in relationship management with our customers. I think I\u2019ve said this before but we\u2019re developing a much smarter technology around who our customers are, what they expect, what they\u2019re likely next needs are, particularly around the mobile banking aspect. And so we\u2019re investing a great deal of our money and time. And in this whole efficiency program you never heard me take anything away from our investment and innovation and entrepreneurship and we\u2019re not because I do believe that\u2019s going to be the next big idea.","So having a payments business and a bank connected together we have the best of both roles because we can touch virtually any paradigm buyer, seller and moving money back and forth. So that\u2019s our number one we\u2019re going to lean on the bank and the payments business that\u2019s coming together. Number two the corporate trust business, that\u2019s been remarkably good for us doesn\u2019t get a lot of visibility it\u2019s actually confusing to a lot of people, but we\u2019re not only domestically quite large and capable but when you start looking at who that\u2019s starting to build over across the pound over in Europe with both our front administration and our new class of corporate trust we\u2019re going to expect a lot from those two businesses as well in 2016.","And finally I'll say the next chapter in our wholesale bank becoming we've moved out of the audition stage and we\u2019re now bonafide one of the important banks to deal with the large Fortune 100 companies and you think from an M&A deal to our first pallet lead on the deal to just moving money on a very sophisticated way. We are continuing to see momentum there I'm quite proud of what the wholesale commercial bank has done we are celebrating Dick Payne\u2019s retirement this quarter and we are also celebrating the addition of two new leaders coming up from within the company to run the wholesale bank and the capital markets and I expect a lot from the two of them and they've got the capability and energy to pick up where Dick has left us which is a really good starting point. So I would say those three things Erika to answer your question.","Erika Najarian","Thank you for that. And just a follow-up on the question on credit oil and gas and metals and mining aside charge off level for the industry have been abnormally low and I guess maybe Bill if you don\u2019t mind jumping in could you remind us what you think given the risk portfolio embedded U.S. Bank right now. What would you think is your normal charge off rate and how long does it take to get there?","Bill Parker","So again when we talk about normalized we call that through the cycle rate and that a rate that we've talked about before this between 95 and 100 basis points but you don\u2019t really get there you just go through it when you are going into a recession or you are in a recession. So in times where there is stable employment as running right now the rate you see for us is sort of the what would be a normal rate in this kind of economic environment but that over the cycle rate is something that we calculate every quarter and it remains between 95 and 100 basis points it really has not materially changed for us for many-many years.","Erika Najarian","Understood, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein.","John McDonald","Richard I guess I was kind of wondering how should we track the progress of your new emphasis on the non FTE expense control this year where should we look at to kind of see how you are doing from the external metrics and then what kind of confidence level do you have and the ability to deliver a positive operating leverage this year in the environment that you are planning for?","Richard Davis","First of all you can measure all of our expenses quarter-to-quarter and I think you know we are as transparent as silathane so we\u2019re going to tell you exactly any moving parts and then you can model what's left but you will see the benefits in this quarter and will you see them in the next this two current year of both the FTE watch hold placement we have had on adding people unless we needed them and the non the more discretionary expenses. I will tell you however and we are also going to tell you about along the way how we are going to spend money on things that we think are quite important I will start bringing more visibility to our innovation budget and the kind of money we are spending to be at the front-end of some of the those new ideas and we\u2019re going to be introducing a very significant branding and reputation campaign in 2016 which impacts some of that savings will go toward because I want to keep investing I just want to put in the more of the right places. So no watch for existing number but watch for the moving parts and I will give you the visibility of that so that you can make that assessment over the course of time.","John McDonald","In terms of what you are expecting for kind of revenue expense growth this year Richard and?","Richard Davis","Well done, I forgot [Multiple Speakers] yes we are, we, no one quarter is going to be a positive operating leverage in this environment but we are still planning this year our plan say positive operating as if for 2016 I will also remind all of you that quarter one is our weakest quarter so it\u2019s not the one I'm going to be able to showcase and show off as our strongest quarter because this is seasonally lower for us, but it will I think a better first quarter than you have seen than the lot but it is certainly is going to be on its way to a positive operating leverage if we don\u2019t get at least that second of two rate increases that will put a challenge on that ability so I'm not going to make any guarantees but I'm more concerned less about the rate itself and the fact that rates moving up will continue to reflect that the Fed believes the economy is stronger what we care most about is just strong economy, the metrics and the arithmetic of the 25 basis points is far or less important so we will get to watch it as we go and I'll keep you as clearly outlined on how we think that's going.","John McDonald","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on the loan growth, what got better this quarter it gets you into that 1.7% growth and what are the assumptions underlie the outlook for the 1% to 1.5% range going forward is it more of a consumer pickup driving that and do you assume as the United slows a bit here going forward?","Andy Cecere","Hi, John, this is Andy. I would corporate continues with the strong as you saw year-over-year growth about 9% and strong on a linked quarter basis I think what's turned a little bit more positive is the consumer side of the equation our two fronts our mortgage activity on balance sheet that jumbles principally continues to be strong and home equity for the first time in a whiles we\u2019re seeing growth in that category and as we dig into that a little bit further I understand what that's about we are seeing consumers taking home equity and using it for home equity so using it to improve their homes, furnishings and things of that sort so those two categories are strengthening and finally card spend and card balances are also growing so I do think we see continued strength on wholesale with increasing strength on consumer.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor","Kathy, if I could just follow-up on the 1Q expense outlook I think you said stable linked quarter, are there any one time expenses related to that Fidelity Card deal because I think you normally have some seasonality on the way down on expenses on one tier?","Kathy Rogers","Yes let me talk about that, there's a couple of things that are going on with that, because you're right, we normally would see a first quarter decline in expenses but I'll answer your first question and add some more light, so yes, we would expect to see some onetime expenses related to the Fidelity card deal that will come through in the first quarter and then just the overall operating expenses related to that will increase as we move through the year starting in the first quarter. Additionally, if you think about first quarter expense, we usually have the seasonally lower first quarter of course our tax credit expense in fourth quarter was lower than we normally would have seen and that's really due to a mix of where that's recorded so you also saw that our tax rate was a bit higher. So, that benefit that we get on a linked quarter basis for tax credit is going to be lower than what you'd have seen in the past and that coupled with the Fidelity card business shows to be relatively stable.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. And then a bigger picture Richard for you, maybe you can comment on your ability and appetite on the acquisition side of things, I think you guys talked about in the third quarter 10-Q, some things around to know your customer and obviously there's some price resetting occurring right now as we speak, so maybe you could update it for the current environment and how you can re-apply your net if at all?","Richard Davis","Yes. So the answer I'll give you Matt, first and foremost is what you see we've done is what we want to do more up, so you saw these two fairly large portfolios in the card business that we continue to be attracted toward, these are picking up portfolios that already have momentum, the picking up portfolios and we're finding more and more people interested in allowing us to take a look at that. So, I hope there'll be more of those. We've talked before about our merchant acquiring business and the -- where we've cobbled that together over the last now 15 years is to find a partner, work with him on a JV kind of a basis with their rent to own sense and there's more of that in Europe that we're continuing to look at and hopefully opportunities in that regard as well.","And then finally the more classic kind of opportunities, I talk about innovation and there maybe some small businesses of small companies from small garage, deal that we might find where we want to bring the capability in house and not outsource it and if those come along at the right price at the right moment, we'll also not hesitate there. As it relates to full bank in acquisitions and interests, our interests remains exactly what it was, we don\u2019t have a high interest and there's no one knocking on our door and yet at the same time it's a good thing because given the consent order that we entered into in October we wouldn't be allowed to do a full bank acquisition until we're through and of half that considerable on which we're moving swiftly along and actually have been predicting that we can move that as swiftly as anyone ever has. So, we're well aware that at the point in time we want to buy someone we want to be past that point and our goal is to be there but now it's not inhibiting anything that we would otherwise want to do and I think portfolios and merchant acquirer will be the two places you should watch the most.","Matt O'Connor","And what so fast as someone else's gone through a consent order?","Richard Davis","You actually don\u2019t know because I am not exactly should roll us into one but I know that there is in our case we've talked with our OCC which is the lead regulator here, and made it clear to them that our goals to satisfy the aspects of the consent order that would otherwise preclude us from being able to buy things and make that our number one area, they've made that clearly well that they understand that's our goal and I don't believe you have to be all out to be all done, you just need to be accomplishing the things that are most concerned to them as it relates to branch related, know your customer thing. So, we're going to approach on that basis. And the OCC has also been on record saying how one of their goals this year is to move more swiftly with the closure of open issues and we're going to hopefully be one of the first to prove that and we'll work through that swiftly and we've been working on it actually for quite some time and have lined everything up now to move out of that as soon as they give us permission as we prove our sustainability. So, it's not impairing us now I mean well, if we're not out of that in a year or two but it's not in the harms-way at this point now.","Matt O'Connor","I mean I could just squeeze in one more here, I guess the point I'm getting at is -- you've been more conservative while pre-crisis, during the crisis, post-crisis, and I'm trying to get sense of if the mentality is let\u2019s see if some of our conservatism and capital and deposit base to look for opportunities out there, I mean my guess some sellers maybe interested at a much lower price than before, there's some assets in the capital markets that are being significantly re-priced, you could probably gain a lot of share on energy if you wanted to now, so I'm just trying to get a sense if like is that the mentality or is it just [Multiple Speakers].","Richard Davis","We've been together the whole time, so, what you know about us is we kind of set a monster in place which is we will never do anything that doesn't look sustainable and repeatable, and it sounds corny but we've done it long enough it's real. And you think about opportunities that come along if it is a portfolio and it's priced perfectly and it's within the scheme of our risk tolerance absolutely we're all over it. Many of them that will come to us at a slightly disadvantaged risk perspective and if we don't convince ourselves to make it up in volume or to buy it now and change our original mantra we'll take the hit from you guys for not having that acquisition but we will take the benefit years later or months later and we don\u2019t have a problem. So, what I'd say, our conservatism is every bit exactly what it was before and during the downturn and we're not tinted by anything right now that would otherwise cause us to change that thinking and that could disappoint a few people that slow and steady it kind of wins the race, so we\u2019re going to stay in that boat.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Scott Siefers of Sandler O'Neill.","Scott Siefers","Let\u2019s see first one is sort of a piggy back question did you guys quantify the specific size of both the extra taking and then the legal and compliance accruals? And if not, I mean could you please?","Kathy Rogers","Yes.","Richard Davis","I mean it is our job to do. We have the best to know it out so I could [Multiple Speakers] either away so it is not...","Kathy Rogers","So thank you very much.","Richard Davis","I am calling you for the money.","Kathy Rogers","Yes. So the, Scott yes so the gain on the HSA sale is right in that $50 million range and I would suggest you think about half of that were related to the regulatory and legal accruals.","Scott Siefers","And then just so I am certain the guidance for fees and expenses in the first quarter is off the reported numbers out, am I right?","Kathy Rogers","That\u2019s right.","Scott Siefers","So thank you for that and then second question either for you Kathy or Richard just as it relates to margin. Even though you guys characterized as relatively stable it was still up which I consider a good thing. Just curious in your mind what it would take whether it\u2019s how much more rate increases, how many more rate increases I should say, or an increased pace of the increases until sort of the buyers get a little more optimistic, in other words at what point do we more visibly see the margins starting to expand?","Kathy Rogers","Yes. I think there is a couple of things I do think we need a couple of more rate increases to see a material change in our margin. I think that was as important Scott is that we have to we\u2019ve been talking a lot about this pricing pressure on some of the different portfolios. And I think we need to see that start to stabilize a little bit. But certainly as we think about where we are today and if you think about where our margin improved from last quarter. We did have some nice growth in our loan portfolio which allowed us to essentially fund out some cash for that allowed us to go forward. So as if we move forward I think the mix of our business interest rates increasing will certainly help in some of that price pressure easing will certainly be in potential list.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore ISI.","John Pancari","Just back on that on the margin comment just to clarify that, so basically if you don\u2019t see any incremental rate hikes, if you don\u2019t get that June hike, is it fair to assume that you expect a relatively stable margin through all 2016 or could you see degradation?","Kathy Rogers","I think it\u2019s going to come, and I would suggest that it would probably I would say it start with relatively stable. But I think some of the caveats for that would be really around some of the mix of our portfolio and then of our loan growth and then also as you know in our securities portfolio we have about $2 billion run off, so to the extent where those reinvestment rates falls could potentially impact the margin. And then also I would tell you we\u2019re keeping our eyes very close on the long term rates and what\u2019s happening on the long term rates. So I think all of those together would impact it, but with no rate increase I would say we\u2019re probably in a little bit of a steady state here.","John Pancari","And then back to the M&A topic, Richard I heard when you said about interest and M&A. If you did not have the consent order in place, what would be your appetite around larger whole bank deals? I know you used to say you had no interest in the holding company transactions, and shying away from large deals. But is that appetite steadily changing given the disruption and the opportunity maybe to capitalize on valuations et cetera?","Richard Davis","No, you can all exaggerate on no. But the reason I said I am on record for a quite while John saying that from our own experiences of the statute I am going to call it a statute limitations it\u2019s not legal by any means was that you can still pick up a company and you can still be placed in harms away for dealing with any of their potential problems involving their own. And I think it\u2019s all the way back to 2007. When you think of \u201907 that is in your window on when things start to roll off in terms of statute and we\u2019re already seeing things continue to come to and people try to get under the wire. I\u2019ve always said 2017 will be the first time we want to look at where our appetite for bringing on a risk into our company as we simply couldn\u2019t do diligence for and couldn\u2019t possibly imagine that at least elegantly have lined up with our current moment where we can\u2019t do it anyway but we don\u2019t want to anyway, and I wouldn\u2019t be interested. The pricing doesn\u2019t change you can\u2019t get a good enough deals if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting. And I could be wrong but I feel very strongly about that and have for a long time and I would say that as the moments clear let\u2019s say a year or more from now our ability is there, our appetite will be higher, the moment and time I think will be safer and all those things will line up and then we could be very much involved and engaged in that.","But the reason we\u2019re most importantly of less interested is we don\u2019t really need it, I mean much of is attractive to have the wallpaper behind me and somebody else shaking hands it's really not necessary for this company and we are in every business line that we\u2019re in that we want, we\u2019re not in anything, we don\u2019t want to be in if we do we sell it like the HSA deposit business. And we don\u2019t covered anything we don\u2019t have, we just want to be better at what we\u2019re doing and do it better deeper wherever we are. That would be attractive to me but it\u2019s not going to be a headline on kind of the deal at least as long as I am around, this never has been, it\u2019s just going to be a steady state kind of an approach. But I would hope that all those stars would line up, so our options are better in a year or two from now.","John Pancari","And then if I could just throw in one more on the loan growth side on the residential mortgage front can you just I know you indicated that growth could remain around where it is I think you implied that and so you still have the appetite to continue to add to that portfolio regardless of what the longer end of the curve is doing here?","Richard Davis","Yes. We continue to add residential mortgages principally jumbo prime mortgages home equity as I said is the other category that's growing and balance credit cards. Those are areas that can, the slope is upward the area continues to be strong as auto lending and as Kathy mentioned a little bit the challenge on the loan lending as well behind this great, spreads are challenged but given our cost of funds we are still very profitable but not as profitable as they were a year ago.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR.","Paul Miller","On the mortgage banking side, we know we had the new disclosures in the CFEP trade, but it looks like your mortgage banking was in line with what we expected. Can you talk about how you managed to do the trade? It looks like it wasn't that big of a deal for you guys?","Richard Davis","Yes Paul. So we had a significant team of folks who are focused it is growing effort and we were able to automate much of the process we had about 40 major conversion to do that last weekend in fact so it was a little bit of a backlog that occurred because just natural process of the new disclosures new requirements costs more time but it wasn\u2019t usually impactful and as you said our results were pretty much in line with what we expected we might have a little bit of a pickup in the first quarter from that lag but we are principally automated in that and very good shape.","Paul Miller","And then on the other side, because you do have a pretty good pulse on the consumers out there, do you see a big pickup in purchases? We had a very strong purchase market, probably the strongest we've had in seven years in 2015. Do you see that continue in 2016?","Richard Davis","So the year started as you know all about that so the year started in about 50-50 purchase versus refinance ended the year about two thirds one third and sort of the normal environment is 75-25 and that's what we expect as to go into 2016 about 75% of the volume being new money and 25% refinancings.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura.","Bill Carcache","On your Fidelity co-brand win, it seems like that's a product that's going to give you exposure to national spend from a fairly affluent customer base. Should we conclude that you guys are seeking to become more of a national player in card? It certainly seems like you're expanding beyond -- well beyond your footprint?","Andy Cecere","While we already are a national player in card so this was just adding in that what we\u2019re seeking is always a good portfolio with good customers and this is a great example it is a high quality portfolio it offers us a great opportunity for growth and our customers service levels with this portfolio I think is what's going to make the difference so it's a continuation now we\u2019re doing that will be also the same with the Auto Club portfolio. So as Richard mentioned I think those are focus areas for us have been and will continue to be.","Richard Davis","Hey Bill, it's Richard. I don\u2019t know how long you have followed us but many-many years ago one of our biggest moment in time was when we had lost the WorldPerks card from Northwest airlines and it went to American Express were in Delta by Northwest and we came up with the FlexPerks card which I am going to say this now when I retire would be one of the top three things I think we ever did really-really well here and is very national. In fact when I talk to you guys if auto were to go down to $10 to $15 and would shut at the thought but if I had to talk to you about where the tangent risk would be we would be talking about the unemployment issues in those areas affected mostly by oil and the energy and our very own customers you may be surprised have a lot of people in parts that we don\u2019t have branches that have that credit card and like it a lot so it will be our own victim of success here but it's been quite national for five-six years and Andy is right we just want to be more perceived at that and we are not going to hesitate to take national forward growth just like we worked commercial real estate or wholesale banking if we want book for branches to be considered a national player and everything else.","Bill Carcache","If I could ask one more on a different topic, there are some banks who many would put into the quality bucket who have significant excess liquidity parked at the Fed. And there are others that use their excess liquidity to restructure the right-hand side of their balance sheets and therefore don't have that liquidity available today. Obviously everyone regards you guys as being in that kind of high-quality camp, but you don't appear to have as much excess liquidity that you're holding at the Fed. Can you remind us of why that is?","Kathy Rogers","Yes. We look at our liquidity as you know we have got 9.1% on our common equity tier one ratio that's about 110 basis points above our target of 8%. And if you think about it we\u2019re holding that excess rate between our target and where we\u2019re actually performing because we haven\u2019t been able to really reinvest or grow our loan balances as much as we would want so if we can get back into that 6% plus the balance sheet growth and so forth I think that you will see our capital to be right in line with kind of our real target.","Richard Davis","And it is exactly right Kathy and I would add actually the one of the reasons we don\u2019t access liquidity on the balance sheet is because we were building our securities portfolio to adjust the LCR exactly the right time at the time the deposits were growing faster than loans and we used the excess to build securities so we are very balanced and we sit in that situation today so we are not lying at the Fed in an any material way you are right.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of CLSA.","Mike Mayo","Well, I'll repeat the same question as in the past Richard Davis versus the 10-year. And the 10-year has been winning recently, and here you are talking about faster loan growth, which seems to be that you should be winning over the 10-year as far as what the 10-year is saying about growth. On the other hand, you are seeing what's going on in the market. So my question is, is the economy getting better or worse? What's your conviction level and confidence? And also, as the capital markets, at least in certain areas of the capital markets, liquidity is less plentiful. Is that an opportunity for you to step in and lend even more? Because you said the expansion in loan growth is on the consumer side and on the wholesale side it's the same. But is this an opportunity for you to step in and borrow where some of the nonbanks might be retreating -- I'm sorry, a chance for you to lend more where some of the nonbanks are retreating?","Richard Davis","Let's start first on just general lending appetite, as a junior lender years ago there's still a steady state paradigm that you only make along based on abilities, stability and willingness and the willingness is a low part, people are able to take loans, they're more stable than they had been and other than 8 years but they're just not willing so we can't create willing and we're not going to create willing and those are the most willing are the ones that are too eager, and we don't want them so, that's impart why you're going to see our loan growth I think be steady but not robust because we're going to reflect whatever the economy sets, I also do think our market share has grown a lot and you've all the data to prove it. So, we're getting first look from a lot of customers that maybe in a decade before didn\u2019t think of us as much.","On the capital market side I think you'll also find answers yes we can step in and now be a lender of support for those who have the other alternatives and want to use it in more traditional balance sheet approach to growing their business and as I've said earlier we're no longer auditioning, We're well ensconced now one of the top two or three banks in most large companies\u2019 portfolio or the place they would have called for the opportunity and that comes from our debt ratings Mike. I mean if you're a C suite person at a fortune anything or one of the largest private companies, you really do value our ratings and you value the top notch level that we have and that means more to you than sometimes pricing which we also offer. So, I think in many cased we'll get more than our fare share of the capital markets where there's an interest in using that as an alternative to traditional financing and we set ourselves up perfectly to be early call and a chance to deliver and you might add to any of those since you run them.","Bill Parker","I think that's right, and I think the point that you made which is the market share point of the equation and I saw that growth perhaps is a little higher than what the average and most of that's coming from taking market share and that's certainly driving the wholesale side of the equation and it comes back to that ratings discussion that you discussed.","Mike Mayo","On that last point, as you see private equity firms back away from some energy companies and you see some loan funds that have gotten burnt back away, is that an opportunity for you to step in and lend more to say oil and gas companies? And I'm sorry I got on the call a couple minutes late. Did you indicate what are you reserves against oil and gas loans?","Richard Davis","Yes I will jump in first of all, nothing you said changes our appetite for risk, we're not going to change it no matter how attractive things look and you targeted that part earlier. As Bill talked earlier, our energy portfolio is only 1.2% of the company, we've added reserves to at this particular quarter, we're at 5.4% reserves against the energy portfolio for our company which I think will prevail to be a reasonable place at this point in time with oil at $29, $30, I also said we've plenty of room and appetite and willingness to move those new reserves higher up if we need to and we're watching as we stress test, the heck out of those things. But as it relates to taking alternatives, we want to be a capital markets alternative to more traditional lending but having to do with the risk profile that's unique and different than it is today, it doesn\u2019t matter what it is we're not going to do it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja of JP Morgan.","Vivek Juneja","A couple of questions, just trying to get a sense of what you are seeing in the marketplace, C&I loans, your yields were flat, LIBOR was up through the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about -- we're not seeing any impact of that -- why? And then yields are fairly low at 286 or something like that I believe, so -- or no, 268 actually?","Andy Cecere","This is Andy so the corporate spreads are a function of two things, one is where our growth is coming is more from the high quality side of the portfolio so a little bit less on the highly levered things like that that are falling off and some of the leasing portfolio and we're seeing high quality corporate growth which is a little thinner strategy all right. The second is some of the growth that you're seeing is also short term in terms of the tenure which is causing -- it is a little bit of a thinner spread perhaps our linkage to a bond deal that's short term in nature related to an M&A transaction, so it is a little thinner again and what is typically on the books, but again high quality, still profitable but just a little different mix.","Vivek Juneja","Secondly, on the NIM side, going back to the comments you and Kathy and the others made, you've got a very healthy amount of noninterest deposits, even though I know it's only 25 basis points. I'm presuming -- are you firstly, are you passing -- have you begun passing anything on at all to any of your customers? And secondly, given that shouldn't we -- what's offsetting the NIM benefit from all of your low cost deposit base?","Kathy Rogers","Yes. So at this point, we are passing we're seeing some interest rate increases particularly around our wholesale side. We haven\u2019t seen a whole lot of movement right now on the consumer side and I think that\u2019s pretty true across the industry. So that is as we look into quarter one that the fact that those re-pricings are starting but starting a little bit maybe lower than what we would have potentially modelled I think is basically benefiting us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush of NAB Research.","Nancy Bush","Richard, several quarters ago I asked you about projects that you might be investing in, if you saw better revenue trends. I think you said at that time you had a whole list of projects that you wanted to dive into when things looked a little better. Are we at that point yet? Do you still have that list, or have you started to implement some of these investments?","Richard Davis","I remember saying that, and first of all what we didn\u2019t do is with our efficiency program we didn\u2019t stop as I said earlier our innovation and our investment in our technology. So one thing is that I would have put back first was something I never took out. The other one I think I mentioned was wealth management and the ultrahigh net worth and building more locations, physical locations, people to come in visit. We currently have six I\u2019d love to move that to a much higher level. It's going to be a long investment lead so I\u2019ve got to be thoughtful I do it if I could right now. But the investment we did so long and until I see a more robust economy with interest rate increases I would be putting too much ahead of that and put ourselves on harms-way. So those would be the two that I would mention, I meant when I mentioned it to you and one of them we\u2019re still doing the other one we\u2019ve got on the place where they\u2019re ready to roll in to.","Nancy Bush","Yes, and could you just give us -- Andy, this might be a question for you -- you mentioned the auto business. What's your outlook for this year? You're coming off such a strong year. Can you just sort of give us some color on that segment?","Andy Cecere","I would expect the growth to be similar with what we saw off 2015, more focused on the lending side versus the leasing side and with it principally trying auto on the lending side. So, to stress this situation what might have been 110, 120 basis points is maybe down to 100 or right around that area, a lot of that\u2019s because of the aggressive nature of the manufacturers. But I think on a growth prospect a very -- prospects for \u201916 are going to be very similar to what you saw in \u201915.","Nancy Bush","Are you picking up market share there? Is that part of your growth picture?","Andy Cecere","Yes. We are both with dealers as well as certain manufacturers that we\u2019re trying to partner with in different ways a little bit on the lending side but also on the leasing side.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio of KBW.","Chris Mutascio","A lot of my questions have been asked and answered. A couple nitpicky things I guess. Kathy, can you refresh my memory, who did you sell the HSA deposit portfolio to?","Kathy Rogers","That was Optum Bank.","Chris Mutascio","I am sorry, to who?","Kathy Rogers","Optum Bank.","Chris Mutascio","And then, and Richard, I appreciate you calling out the gain in HSA and maybe the possible offset in terms of the expenses in the quarter to get more of a run rate. And I hope you don't think I'm beating you up too much, but should I really back out the expenses in the quarter tied to legal and compliance since first quarter your level expense is supposed to be similar to the reported level in fourth quarter?","Kathy Rogers","There is going to be a lot of moving parts of this and we\u2019re very early in the quarter. But I think that if you go with the guidance of just relatively stable because I think you will -- that\u2019s what we\u2019re thinking of as we look out into the first quarter.","Richard Davis","I am going to give you something you don\u2019t know which is why you called. This year we\u2019re going to look back on 2015 and we\u2019re not going to payout 100% of our bonus pool. This is my 10th year as CEO and that\u2019d the first year we didn\u2019t and I am okay with that because we live and die by the sword and our guys are amazingly competent and capable. And when we have great years we pay them out handsomely over 100% of target and when we don\u2019t we don\u2019t. And so what that means to you is the accrual goes back to 100% in first quarter because you expect to make your plan. And so that\u2019s a fairly interesting delta I am not going to slide it for you exactly but that would be something that I would have told you more next quarter but I might as well change that because you are struggling to think it through why we would otherwise want to stay stable that is another fairly meaningful part of it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom of Guggenheim.","Eric Wasserstrom","Just one final question on expenses, which has been discussed at great length, but I just want to understand how -- what is actually funding these growth initiatives. Is it strictly the benefit of the top-line growth that's occurring in some measure? Or is it coming from efficiency savings that continue to be gained in other places?","Richard Davis","Well, in terms of you are speaking innovation particularly we just have that in the run rate for about seven or eight years it\u2019s just something that would be easy to slowdown and that\u2019s the part of descending that we didn\u2019t. I can\u2019t underestimate enough when you have a acquiring payments business not just in issuing you get to work with the merchant not the commercial customer the merchant the one who sells stuff and then you get to bring your consumers in and we pilot and test all kinds of relationships and partnerships and we learn best practices, consumer preferences, merchant progresses and some of the stuff never makes it to the street because it\u2019s really a bad idea but it looked good. So that we don\u2019t want to slowdown that's been in the run rate for Eric for as many years as I could remember so there is no new increased cost and as I said earlier things like our large brand reputation campaign we are going to launch this year will cost money we haven\u2019t have the run rate so it is going to come impart from the efficiency program some we will give it back to the shareholders some we will keep for ourselves and investment in things people always wanted to do so that's kind of the way to think about it.","Eric Wasserstrom","Okay. And you've given I think very clear guidance about the first quarter, but has anything that's occurred in terms of portfolio acquisitions or other kinds of dynamics further disrupt what would be the typical quarterly cadence in terms of expense seasonality?","Richard Davis","That is all. You are right to ask that in fact I think in this quarter we are going to go back at our next opportunity to show and remind people how steady our fourth quarters are and how -- which quarter is strongest which one is weakest and how the linked quarters move and I am only saying that because it's a really it's so consistent you can set your watch by it and it is a probably a good way to go back and look.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Credit quality for you guys has been good and you continue to expect that it's going to remain very good, but the world is obviously starting to worry about bigger other things. So you guys don't have to worry so much about energy, but Rich, I'm just wondering -- I don't know if Bill's there -- but back in all of your industries and your subgroups, what are you starting to watch for? What, if anything, are you concerned could go the wrong way? We're certainly not seeing it in NPAs, delinquencies, et cetera, across the Company. So can you just tell us your underlying comfort in terms of how things are going and what you will be watchful of?","Richard Davis","I will have Bill answer that but I do want to call out what a good question that was because dealing with our Board of Directors we haven\u2019t really focused on credit in many years and I'm putting it right back at the front runner because I want to start watching trends and we are going to watch competitors and we\u2019re going to watch different buckets and tranches and we are going to learn a lot all of us by what's about to happen if we start learning about these small moves now don\u2019t look very big that they can be quite tell-tell of what is going to happen so you ask more questions like that because that's going I think give us a chance to I'll talk about risk profile and likely future losses but Bill why don\u2019t you answer the question and what's your -- more or so a word about after energy and precious metals.","Bill Parker","Yes I mean really it is the impacted areas in the country that we would look most closely at so if you think about the Dakota there is not a lot of people or infrastructure out there other than what's in the oil and gas but if you get to a state like Texas and the Houston area where it is a fairly energy dependent economy so you really look at a kind of newly unemployed trend and that's a thing that's going to generate potential delinquencies in the consumer portfolios and then that just has a ripple effect in terms of lower demand for small business both etcetera so we would focus very closely on watching the economies around the kind of the energy belt areas in the United States we do have as Richard said earlier we\u2019re national and for real state national and our own card so we have been watching carefully we have not seen any impact yet even though we would be seeing 50,000 oil workers have lost their jobs in the last year or so but it really has not shown up and I feel bad but those are the kinds of things that we want every day.","Ken Usdin","Okay, and one follow-up just you guys talk a lot about the strength in the payments businesses and then we still have that offsetting potential benefit from the energy subsidy that's not quite coming through. So in terms of just payments growth and underlying, can you just talk about do you envision the energy subsidy starting to get spent? Or do you think that's just an ongoing drag in certain parts of the businesses and we're not quite seeing it offset to the positive in other?","Andy Cecere","This is Andy so I wouldn\u2019t say that the energy subsidy is being spent into a large degree so we are seeing steady growth in our card growth as you saw is very good we had a very good Christmas season the holiday season if you compare our contrasted our master card numbers would show up from Black Friday through Christmas Eve would say of 7.9% growth that was just over 10% growth which is better than it was last year but it's not substantially better so we are good and steady but we are not seeing all the dollars saved on the energy side moving to spend on the consumer side.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy of Stephens.","Terry McEvoy","I was wondering if you could just talk about the headwinds to credit and debit card revenue in 2016 just from lower equipment sales that kind of were up in Q3. You mentioned they were down a bit in Q4. And then maybe just as a follow-on, that same question on revenue given lower gas prices and what that does to the fleet vehicle card at Elavon?","Richard Davis","Right so actually the spend activity on merchant terminals peak in the third quarter came down about 1% or 2% in the fourth quarter and I would expect it to be fairly level going into 2016. There is still a number of merchants who have been purchasing terminals that we would expect to steady state without occurring but the headwinds so to speak as you described it was about a 1.5% to 2% in the fourth quarter but I don\u2019t expect there is a lot of further headwind going into 2016.","Terry McEvoy","And then just a quick question for Kathy, the tax rates kind of jumped around. Could you give us a little insight into full-year 2016 for the tax rate?","Kathy Rogers","Yes, you're right, the tax rate did rise in the fourth quarter and that was principally due to the fact that we had some mix change in our tax credit business so as I look out into 2016 I'd put that rate in the kind of in that 28% to 29% range and as I've said today we're probably right in the middle of that range.","Operator","This concludes our Q&A portion for today's call. I will now turn the call back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Richard Davis","Thank you for listening to this review of our fourth quarter 2015 and full year 2015 results. Please contact us if you have any follow-up questions. Have a good day.","Bill Parker","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"20827":["U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call September 16, 2019  9:30 AM ET","Company Participants","Jen Thompson - Director, Investor Relations","Andy Cecere - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Terry Dolan - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","John McDonald - Autonomous Research","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Mike Mayo - Wells Fargo Securities","Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill","Erika Najarian - Bank of America.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Saul Martinez - UBS","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Operator","Welcome to U.S. Bancorp\u2019s Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Terry Dolan, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 12:30 PM Eastern through Wednesday, October 23rd at 12 Midnight Eastern Standard Time.","I will now turn the conference over to Jen Thompson, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. You may begin.","Jen Thompson","Thank you, Polly and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Andy Cecere and Terry Dolan are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s third quarter results and to answer your questions. Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.","I\u2019d like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today\u2019s presentation, in our press release, and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Andy.","Andy Cecere","Thanks Jen. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry and I will take your questions.","I'll begin on Slide 3. In the third quarter, we earned $1.15 per share. Despite a more challenging interest rate environment, we reported record levels of revenue and net income, driven by healthy loan and deposit growth and continued momentum across our key businesses. Credit quality remained stable.","Turning to capital management, our book value per share increased 10.6% from a year ago and during the quarter, we returned 80% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.","Slide 4 provides key performance metrics. In the third quarter, we delivered a return on average common equity of 15.3% and a return on average assets of 1.57%. Our return on tangible common equity was 19.4%. Positive operating leverage drove improvement in our efficiency ratio on both a linked-quarter and a year-over-year basis.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Terry, who will provide more detail on the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance.","Terry Dolan","Thanks Andy. If you turn to Slide 5, I'll start with the balance sheet review followed by a discussion of third quarter earnings trends. As expected, average loans grew 1.1% on a linked-quarter basis and increased 4.7% year-over-year excluding the fourth quarter 2018 sale of FDIC-covered loans that had reached the end of the loss coverage period.","Strong residential mortgage and credit card loan growth supported both linked-quarter and year-over-year performance. Commercial and industrial loans grew 0.4% sequentially and 4.7% on a year-over-year basis. Paydown activity picked up in the third quarter, primarily reflecting the rate environment and robust capital market conditions. New business activity remains healthy, although paydown activity is likely to continue at elevated levels near term.","Commercial Real Estate loans decreased on a sequential and a year-over-year basis. This quarter, Commercial Real Estate contributed a 33-basis-point drag to linked-quarter average loan growth and an 89-basis-point drag to year-over-year average loan growth.","Turning to slide 6, deposits increased 1.4% on a linked-quarter basis and grew 6.0% year-over-year.","Compared with the prior period, we continued to see migration from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing accounts. That migration along with deposit growth momentum in both our Wealth Management and Corporate and Commercial Banking divisions, helped drive average savings deposits up 8.4% year-over-year.","As you can see on slide 7, credit quality remained stable. On dollar basis, non-performing assets increased 2.7% versus the second quarter, but decreased by 2.5% compared with a year ago.","The ratio of non-performing assets to loans plus other real estate owned was stable at 33 basis points compared with the second quarter and modestly improved versus 36 basis points a year-ago.","Slide 8 highlights third quarter earnings results. We reported earnings per share of $1.15 compared with $1.06 a year ago.","Turning to slide 9, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis declined by 0.5% compared with the second quarter and increased by 0.8% year-over-year, which is in line with our expectations.","Both linked quarter and year-over-year comparisons benefited from healthy loan growth, offset by the impact of declining rates and a flatter yield curve. Our net interest margin declined by 11 basis points versus the second quarter, in line with our expectations. About 4 basis points of the decline was due to higher cash balances, primarily reflecting changes in policies related to deposits by the European Central Bank.","Slide 10 highlights trends in non-interest income. Middle-single-digit year-over-year growth in each of the three payment fee lines, credit and debit card, corporate payments products, and merchant processing was driven by higher sales volumes.","As a reminder, processing day account will end up affecting year-over-year credit and debit card revenue growth comparisons in several quarters in 2019. In the third quarter, three additional processing days versus a year ago benefited revenue growth. In the fourth quarter, two fewer days will be a drag on year-over-year growth.","We continue to expect low-single-digit growth of credit and debit card fee revenue for the full year. Commercial product revenue increased 11.1% from a year ago, primarily due to higher corporate bond fees and trading revenue related to strong capital markets activity.","Mortgage banking revenue increased 56.3% year-over-year on strong origination and sales revenue growth. Compared with the third quarter of 2018, mortgage production volume increased by 40.3%, and mortgage application volume increased by 53.1%.","Refinancing activity represented about 40% of production in the third quarter of 2019 compared to about 30% in the linked-quarter. Refinancing represented 51% of applications in the third quarter. The year-over-year decline in deposit service charges reflected the impact of the sale of our third-party ATM servicing business in the fourth quarter of 2018.","The increase in other revenue was partly driven by the inclusion of the related transition services revenue, which will decrease over time, as well as higher equity investment income and a gain on sale of assets.","Turning to slide 11, the year-over-year increase in non-interest expense reflected higher personnel cost, partly due to higher variable compensation related to business production within mortgage banking and the capital markets business lines as well as increased medical costs.","Professional services expense increased primarily due to business investments and enhancement in risk management programs, while higher technology expense growth was primarily tied to business growth initiatives. A decrease in other expense primarily reflected lower costs related to tax-advantaged projects and lower FDIC assessment cost.","Slide 12 highlights our capital position. At September 30, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach was 9.6%, and this compares to our target of 8.5%.","As previously discussed, our goal has been to manage the capital level closer to our target once we had clarity related to adopting CECL and the final capital rules were promulgated by the Federal Reserve.","With the recent release of the final rules, we plan to make a request to the Federal Reserve to increase our share repurchase program to enable us to begin reducing our common equity Tier 1 ratio from 9.0 -- 9.6% to approximately 9.0%.","I'll now provide some forward looking guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to decline in the low-single digits on a year-over-year basis. We expect middle \u2013 mid-single-digit fee income growth on a core basis year-over-year. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the full year 2019 on a core basis in line with our previous guidance.","We continue to expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 20% on a full year basis. Credit quality in the fourth quarter is expected to remain stable compared to the third quarter, loan loss provision expense growth will continue to be reflective of loan growth.","I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.","Andy Cecere","Thanks Terry. The record results and industry-leading returns that we delivered in the third quarter, despite a more challenging interest rate environment is a testament to our well-balanced business model, our numerous competitive advantages and our risk management discipline. As we head in the final quarter of 2019, we feel good about our loan and deposit trends and our ability to continue to gain market share across our franchise.","As indicated on slide 13, we are seeing good digital update trends. As loans are increasingly sourced through our digital channels, we expect better customer experience, higher account and volume growth and improved operational efficiency.","Our core fee businesses are performing well. Investments made over the past few years in our payments and mortgage business lines are delivering anticipated results in the form of improving sales and volume growth.","Our scale and differentiated service model is helping us win new business and expand existing relationships in our trust and Investment Services business which is driving strong asset under management and fee growth. Importantly, we are deepening relationships across our entire franchise, as we bring the power of one U.S. Bank to each of our business customers and consumers.","Credit quality remains stable and we are not seeing any early indicators in our portfolio that causes concern. However, we are mindful that at some point industry will experience a credit downturn and we remain disciplined in terms of our origination quality and our long-term strategy of remaining within our defined credit box -- regardless of the competitive environment.","In closing, I'd like to reiterate the message I delivered at a recent Investor Day. We are in a position of strength and will continue to leverage the core competencies and competitive advantage that carry us to where we are today. However, the world is changing rapidly and we are adjusting -- investing for the future, so that we can continue to deliver the industry-leading growth and return to our shareholders that come to expect from us. I'd like to thank our employees for their hard work and commitment they bring to the job every day.","We will now open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Andy Cecere","Good morning, Matt.","Jen Thompson","Polly, we're not hearing. We're not hearing, Matt.","Operator","Matt, your line is open.","Jen Thompson","We can go to the next caller and maybe Matt can dial in again.","Operator","Okay. And your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.","John McDonald","Hi. Good morning.","Terry Dolan","Good morning, John.","John McDonald","I was wondering -- Hi, Terry. I was wondering if you could just give a little more color on the request for the capital increase, just over what timeframe you might be looking to do the 9.6% down to 9%? Is that over the course of a year or a couple of months or? And, again, what gave you the -- what was the clarity you're looking for, was it CECL and tailoring, I think, you mentioned?","Terry Dolan","Yes. Well, with respect to the second part, I think, that we've now been through parallel run for a couple of different quarters, and the outlook from an economic standpoint is still relatively solid, and so I think we feel comfortable that we have a good range, and it's consistent with what we talked about at Investor Day. And then, obviously, the final rule coming out is helpful.","From a timing standpoint, it won't be accelerated. I think it will be bringing that 9.6% down to 9.0% really during the 2019 CCAR cycle, so by the end of the second quarter.","John McDonald","Okay. Got it. So, it is for this cycle to do it by the second quarter of next year.","Terry Dolan","Yes. Yes.","John McDonald","Okay. Got it. And then, I wanted to ask you guys just more broadly about your outlook, just in terms of kind of generating positive operating leverage in what's proving to be a difficult -- more difficult rate environment. As you turn the corner into 2020, is that a goal? And is that 100 basis points kind of a bogey still? And Terry you had mentioned at Investor Day that 2020 was a tougher year when you're talking about your three-year targets.","Terry Dolan","Yes.","John McDonald","And maybe also, Terry, you could just kind of clarify, I think, at Investor Day you said part of that outlook is --you thought your net interest income might grow faster than your fees and maybe if you could give a little follow-up color on that?","Terry Dolan","Yes. So a lot of different questions there. Certainly, in terms of positive operating leverage, it's a balancing act between certain long-term and we always kind of take that into consideration. 2020, as I said at Investor Day, I think, it is going to be a challenging year, because of where interest rates are today versus where they were a year ago. I mean, the long end of the curve, 10 years, is I think down 150 -- almost 150 basis points from where it was last year. So, the landscape certainly has changed relative to when that guidance came out.","When we -- right now, I think our outlook, with respect to positive operating leverage, is to achieve that in 2019 on a quarter basis, and as we kind of think about different initiatives, the certain things that we will take into consideration is the fact that our -- we continue to transform from a digital perspective. Derek talked about kind of a do-it-yourself sort of, a focus, so I think, you know, we're going to end up looking to add a lot of different things that we can do in order to try to manage expenses as prudently as we can. But you know, I think part of it is just what happens with interest rates, I mean, as it\u2019s volatile right now, it's hard to really know and having an outlook that's much beyond a quarter is pretty tough.","Coming back to net interest income versus fees that guidance, right, those comments are really focused around what we think between now and three years out where that growth is going to come from, and I think part of that is an assumption that once we get beyond 2020, the interest rate environment starts to normalize and either stabilizes or starts to come up, and so I think that's part of the thought process between where that mix is going to come from.","Andy Cecere","And I\u2019d just reiterate John that the theme that we talked about at Investor Day \u2013 talked about at Investor Day continues to hold which is delivering in the short-term while investing for the long-term. So we're going to manage short-term performance, understanding the rate environment on in the economic environment, but deliver on what we talked about in terms of positive operating leverage but at the same time investing for the long-term growth that we're seeking.","John McDonald","Got it. Thank you. ","Andy Cecere","Sure, John.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Andy Cecere","Good morning, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Hey, good morning. Hi. One follow-up there on the tailoring rule. There's also a benefit I think to the LCR and how your \u2013 reports calculate that and carry cash around that? And I'm wondering, does that have any impact on how you think about either the portfolio that you're holding or your ability to be more competitive for, you know, loans because you can value non-operating deposits or any other benefit from that that maybe we could get a loan under the hood on? ","Andy Cecere","Yes, so with the rules related to the LCR coming out, you know, all it was essentially kind of reducing it to an 80% to 85% level. And as we\u2019ve talked, it really helps free up our liquidity probably in the range of $11 billion to $15 billion kind of in that ballpark. And, you know, we're still formulating kind of what our game plan is, but \u2013 I think that we'll look at kind of remixing the investment portfolio in order to be able to both extend duration and possibly enhance the yield a little bit.","We may look at reducing our debt level in the wholesale markets, and I think that \u2013 a number of those different actions would be beneficial to the company, and it's going to be basis points, it's not going to be a major change I think in terms of net interest income just based upon kind of where the yield curve is, et cetera, but we're looking at all sorts of things.","Betsy Graseck","Right. And I get that. Every little bit helps so.","Andy Cecere","Yes. It does.","Betsy Graseck","And does it impact all the competitiveness with regard to commercial lending or not really? ","Andy Cecere","I don't think so.","Betsy Graseck","Okay.","Andy Cecere","I mean we end up driving from a competitive standpoint based upon what the pricing is in the marketplace. And I just don't see it impacting that a lot.","Betsy Graseck","Okay.","Terry Dolan","And given our debt rating and our low cost of funds we're already in a pretty good position regarding our loan pricing.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. Okay. And then any just separately at Investor Day, really interesting kind of sidebar tech showcase that you had and I want to just understand how you're thinking about the offering that you've got for merchant acquiring Merchant Services? And understand where you think there's more that you can do there to expand your offering either to other verticals take what you've got and your restaurant hospitality, et cetera to other verticals? Or if there is more that you can do with adjacencies on some of the things that you've been adding to over the past year or so?","Terry Dolan","Yes, I think it's a three-pronged strategy. One is, continued focus on e-commerce and ISVs which we made good progress in over the last year, we'll continue to focus on it going forward. Secondly is the focus on certain verticals. You may have a couple of airlines, hotels, industry, and healthcare. And thirdly and importantly and probably the biggest opportunity is just combination of banking, products and services together with merchant products and services.","The fact is all of our merchants need a bank, many of our small business customers need a merchant provider, and our ability to weave and put those products together in a comprehensive set that helps the customers run their business and give them information I think is the key to our focus and one of the areas I think where we see the most potential.","Betsy Graseck","And is it primarily U.S. or is it also Europe? I know you have a more global footprint in this business.","Terry Dolan","Yes, so the first two would be global across the board, that combination of banking and merchant processing would be principally in the U.S.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Thanks.","Terry Dolan","You bet.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Terry Dolan","Good morning, Ken.","Andy Cecere","Hey Ken.","Ken Usdin","Hey good morning guys. How are you doing? Just a couple of fee follow-ups, obviously, mortgage banking was very strong and I'm sure built into your outlook for the fourth quarter growth, but can you just talk about how much more pipeline you expect to pull through on the mortgage side and what you're just seeing in terms of the gain on sale outlook and the loan officer side of the equation there?","Terry Dolan","Yes, so if you think about mortgage banking, I mean obviously, there was a very strong quarter from refinancing. When we end up thinking about the fourth quarter, it's very dependent upon where long-term rates are.","With the rates kind of acting or coming up a little bit most recently, it probably will not be as strong. But I think it will still be a good year-over-year story from a mortgage banking perspective. The application volume is a little strong in production. It was strong in the third quarter. We continue to see that momentum.","The other thing Ken is we talked about this; we've been over time making good investment in mortgage loan officers on the retail side of the equation, enhancing that. The digital platform that we talked about has a very high percentage of application capture and that just helps -- and it helps because those fee to market and our ability to be able to service those customers and get the loans booked.","We went through the last what I would say cycle of refinancing and our processing times were relatively short compared to competitors and certainly what we have experienced in the past and it's all because of those investments.","Ken Usdin","Got it. And a second question, I know this comes up from time-to-time, but inside the other, you always mentioned that the PE gains are there. We know that the ATM agreement is in there as well. Can you help us just understand the magnitude of the PE gains even on a comparison basis if not the number?","And then also just the ATM services -- how much is that in revenues and expenses today and how does that work going forward? Thanks Terry.","Terry Dolan","Yes. So, in terms of other revenue, it is a lumpy category. It ends up going up and down depending upon what's happening within the various categories. It includes a lot of different things and equity investment is just one piece of it. But if we end up looking at the overall increase on a year-over-year basis, I would break it down kind of like this about half of it is related to the transitional services revenue and about 25% of it's related to equity investment and then it's kind of combination of a lot of other things that are kind of driving that.","So, when we think about it, because I know this question is out there when we think about other revenue, we talked a little bit about this.","Over the course of last eight quarters, it has ranged anywhere on a quarterly basis from $160 million to as high as $300 million and when we end up looking at what is a core reasonable level that $200 million range is in that ballpark give or take. It'll be up a little bit some quarters and down a little bit in other quarters. And that's how we think about it.","Ken Usdin","And then could you just -- on the expense side of the ATM, is that a decent part of the growth on the expense side as well the services agreement?","Terry Dolan","Yeah, it is. That service agreement was really negotiated in order to be able to cover the cost and so the cost level associated with making that transition service agreements is fairly similar to the revenue that we\u2019re generating. And from a timing standpoint that will start to go away as conversions are taking place between now and the end of 2020.","Ken Usdin","Got it. Thank you.","Terry Dolan","Yeah.","Andy Cecere","Thanks, Ken.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.","Andy Cecere","Hey, Mike.","Mike Mayo","Hi. I know we just had your Investor Day, you are talking about positive operating leverage, driven by the digital transformation, so I guess I have a front office and a back-office question. The front office question, I guess you closed what like 150 branches in the last year, but it's still a decent deposit growth, so how much growth are you getting through digital channels, or some sort of metric that you can give us?","And then the harder question, the back-office, I mean, you're retooling the inside of the company. Can you give us any metrics when, like data centers, the peak where you are now where you expect them to go, or what percent of your applications you expect to migrate to the public cloud or anything else about the internal retooling too?","Andy Cecere","Mike I'll start and then Terry can add on. So from a sales perspective as we think about the digital initiatives, the revamping of our app and the focus on the digital capabilities it's focused on a couple of areas, one is insights and improving the ability to connect with the customers. But secondly, it's also the ability to improve sales activity and you see some of our loan stats in the deck that we provide as part of the earnings call.","Well, I tell you that both loan activity from a sales perspective as well as deposit activity is growing quite rapidly and we will see a continued movement of more sales activity, transactions is already high as you know digitally, but more sales activity to digital channels I think over time, which will allow for our continued opportunities on the expense side of the equation, and if you think about the backroom.","Terry Dolan","Yeah. So, I mean, was it in the back room or even was in the branches is a big part of the decision around closures related to branches and reinvestment in branches as well is really kind of the intersection of our employees, our people to digital and our customers, obviously, the customer behaviors are changing. The amount of transaction activity that's happening in the branch is significantly less than where it was and in fact 80% of it roughly \u2013 70%, 80% of it goes through the digital channel today.","So, that gives us the opportunity to really reconfigure the branch network both in terms of size and numbers et cetera. And -- but also to changed the focus from a service oriented type of location to something that's much more either sales and\/or advice focus. And so I think, those trends are going to continue, I don't necessarily have specific metrics.","On the deposit side, I would say that there are still room and opportunity for the percentage of sales from the deposit perspective to continue to grow. And I think, Derek at Investor Day had said, you know when you think about the opportunity from a digital perspective from sales and -- we would include deposits in this is that, you know that should get us closer to that 40%, 50% overtime. It'll take a while for us to get there because of the customer adoption that has to take place.","Q \u2013 Mike Mayo","Okay. And then, as far as the back-office, do you give any metrics on number of data centres? Or how many apps you expect to migrate to the public cloud or anything else just on the inside of the company?","Andy Cecere","We haven't disclosed a number of data centres. But I will tell you Mike, as we continue to migrate activity to the cloud and Jeff -- Jeff Von Gillern spoke a little bit about that at Investor Day, but most of our new activity in development will occur in the cloud which offers number of our advantages both in the capacity as well as cost development.","Q \u2013 Mike Mayo","All right. Thank you.","Andy Cecere","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","And your next question comes from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill.","Andy Cecere","Good morning, Scott.","Q \u2013 Scott Seifers","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just Terry, may be some updated thoughts on the margin, given that the noise from some of the transitory stuff in the third quarter, should presumably be settling in the fourth quarter?","I guess; one, when -- and apologies if you said this, when do you have any additional rate cuts baked into your own outlook there? And then, just as we go forward, we still thinking kind of $40 million to $45 million sort of all up will some impact from these rate cut?","A \u2013 Terry Dolan","Yeah. Well, let me kind of talk a little bit about kind of our guidance. And hopefully these will kind of get to some of your points. So our guidance with respect to low-single digits is really kind of looking at the implied market where rates in terms of where they're at in the first couple of weeks of October.","And kind of implied in that is an assumption that you know rates are going to decline and our assumption is that, it will be in 25 basis point cut in both October and in December. And I think there is still question as to December occurs.","The long end of the curve, we are assuming that it's roughly kind of where it is right now. So, that's kind of the assumptions that we're baking into kind of our perspective regarding margin or net interest income.","From a margin perspective, it's down about 11 basis points on a linked-quarter. There's about 4 basis points that's really related to those cash balances supporting the balances.","And so, when we think about the fourth quarter, we would expect our net interest margin to decline, but kind of in the range of that core level which is 7 to 8 basis points.","Q \u2013 Scott Seifers","Okay. So 7 to 8 basis points of margin decline in the fourth quarter?","A \u2013 Terry Dolan","In the fourth quarter. Yeah, I think, the other thing is that, it's just kind of interesting, if you think about third quarter, third quarter from an average perspective, short-term rates are actually up about 29 basis points, 30 basis points, although the long end was down about 100 -- a little over 100.","In the fourth quarter, that would be the first quarter on a year-over-year basis, when the short end is down, kind of in the range of that 40 to 50 basis points and the long end is down 150 basis points.","So in the industry, that's why people are looking at. And we would expect fourth quarter to become more challenging as it will go into the quarter end and into 2020.","Q \u2013 Scott Seifers","Okay. And then, so with that, just so I understand with that 7 to 8 basis points presumably that kind of moderates as we would look at additional rate cuts or is that, that sort of a new, new price that is I want to make sure, I'm sort of understanding that?","A \u2013 Terry Dolan","Yeah. I mean, I would say that given the fact that, that it's so volatile right now and we don't really know where rates are going take a look out beyond the fourth quarter.","Q \u2013 Scott Seifers","Okay. Fair enough. All right, thank you very much. I appreciate it.","A \u2013 Terry Dolan","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Q \u2013 Erika Najarian","Hi. Good morning.","Andy Cecere","Good morning, Erika.","Q \u2013 Erika Najarian","I wanted to follow-up on John's line of questioning, so even outside of mortgage the fee income trends are quite strong. Payments up 5% year-over-year, trust and investment management up 2% year-over-year, and I'm wondering, as we tie that back to your long-term revenue targets, is a 5% fee income clip over that three-year period, too optimistic or about in line with what you're thinking?","I guess, the reason I'm focusing on fees is because, like you said Terry, nobody has any idea on what the curve -- forward curve is going to look like, right? I mean, the probability of October changed over the past two hours. So I'm trying to think about the contribution of fees. And I have a follow-up on balance sheet growth.","Terry Dolan","Yes. Well, maybe, just kind of, again, this kind of ties a little bit to Investor Day and some of the guidance associated with that. The outlook for fee income, in part, will depend upon what happens with rates. I mean, the puts and takes with respect to mortgage banking and so all kind of a function in terms of what happens from a rate perspective.","But, I think, we\u2019re confident when we think about the investments that we've been making both in the payment space of business and our corporate trust and some of the digital capabilities, our capital markets business, all of those, we feel like we have a position of strength at this particular point in time and that momentum will continue to carry.","I mean, there will be puts and takes. It kind of depends upon what happens in the environment. Consumer spend continues to be strong. We don't see anything in the short-term, but where that ends up turning, I wouldn\u2019t get into 2020, is anybody's game.","Q \u2013 Erika Najarian","And on the balance sheet growth contribution to those long-term revenue targets, fully acknowledge the 2020 is going to be challenging. If the rate curve doesn't normalize as you think, but doesn't necessarily get worse than what's in the current expectation. Is there enough opportunity in terms of delivering all of the bank into your current customers, with regards to loan growth.","In other words, that implies to me that we would need mid single-digit loan growth over that three-year period in order to potentially mitigate some of the net interest margin volatility, or lack of help from the yield curve rather.","Terry Dolan","Yeah, maybe a couple of things. The target that we set are kind of based upon where we think the growth rates are going to be as we get into the second and third-year. I tried to be clear that that's not our expectation with respect to 2020 and it's not necessarily a compounded rate over the three years because of the challenges that will happen in 2020. But when you end up -- when we think about the balance sheet right now.","And again, this all kind of depend upon what happens in the economy and that's a little bit hard to predict, but consumers spend and consumer confidence continues to be strong, I think business activity continues to be strong, I think it's moderated somewhat because of tariff policy and that sort of thing or trade policy, but generally, I think the economy is solid.","And when we end up thinking about 2020 from a loan growth perspective, we think that some of the trends that we're seeing this year will continue. And as we talked, third quarter loan growth of about 4.7% on a core basis, we think that's achievable.","And I think from the U.S. bank's perspective, we have the lowest cost of funds in the industry and we have some competitive advantages from a pricing perspective that will enable us to be able to achieve those type of things. So I feel reasonably confident.","Andy Cecere","Yeah. And, Erika, if you think -- if you step back and look at the third quarter, our earning asset growth was just under 5%. Our deposit growth year-over-year was just about 6%. So thinking about the balance sheet growing in that mid-single-digit, I think it\u2019s about right.","Terry Dolan","Yeah.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Great. Thank you.","Terry Dolan","Yeah.","Andy Cecere","Sure.","Operator","And your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan.","Andy Cecere","Good morning, Vivek.","Terry Dolan","Hey, Vivek.","Vivek Juneja","Good morning. Hi. Sorry, we've been jumping on multiple calls. I'm apologizing, if I'm making you repeat something. The other income, did you give any sort of way to think about what's the sort of run rate that seems reasonable?","Terry Dolan","Yeah. We did talk a little bit about that, and maybe just to reiterate, we end up looking at the back and when we think about it, we end up looking at that level on a quarterly basis, it's gone anywhere from $160 million to $300 million.","And as a function of the lumpiness that exists across a lot of different categories of income within that, including equity investments, et cetera. But if I were to \u2013 when we think about kind of that core level on a quarterly basis, $200 million, plus or minus is kind of the where we believe that is a reasonable kind of range.","And if you remember in the past I had said, somewhere between $175 million and $225 million, and that's kind of in that ballpark. So, when you end up looking at the year-over-year for the third quarter, but half of that growth is related to the transition servicing agreement that's tied to the ATM business, and so that goes away over time during 2020 tied to when those conversions occur.","Andy Cecere","Together with the expense.","Terry Dolan","Together with the expense. And the expense is pretty similar to the increase related to the transitions service agreement from a revenue point of view.","Vivek Juneja","And then, another one which is positive operating leverage. Your previous guidance you used to have the 100 to 150, which went to 100. Are you thinking full year 2019 given everything going on you've obviously got positives on mortgage banking, other income running higher, but then NII softer? Is it still closer to 100 basis points or do you think given where rates have gone it's \u2013 that's going to be harder to get to?","Andy Cecere","We're consistent with what we talked about Investor Day, Vivek, which is somewhat below 100 basis points, but still positive operating leverage.","Vivek Juneja","Okay, great. Thank you.","Andy Cecere","Thank you. Yes.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Terry Dolan","Hey, Matt.","Andy Cecere","Welcome back, Matt.","Matt O'Connor","Hi. Thanks. Sorry about that before. Just stepping back kind of a bigger picture this whole operating leverage question. You've got the best revenue growth year-to-date I think of the big banks about 4%. It seems like the expense growth is also the highest. And I guess I am just conceptually wondering like is that the cost of doing business like to get that much revenue growth, that's the expense growth that you need or is there still some catching up in terms of infrastructure or something you are working on a few years ago?","Or is there something trying to get ahead of kind of to help drive revenue growth in the future. And obviously, I'm not looking for specific numbers, but just conceptually, some people would look at you and say, okay the revenue growth is really good but the expense growth was a bit higher, and it might just cost that much to generate that much revenue growth. So maybe you could just comment on something like that.","Andy Cecere","So I will start it Matt and Terry will add on. So first from a big picture standpoint, three big puts and takes. Number one is we're going to continue to optimize the number of initiatives from an operation standpoint, the way we\u2019re delivering products and services. The way we are operating in the back room and all those things will allow for some saves because that's a positive.","Secondly, we are going to continue to invest with the long-term. In the digital initiatives we talked about Investor Day, so that's going to cost bit more, a lot of that\u2019s already in the run rate.","If you look at the third quarter specifically though, there were a couple of areas of revenue growth, specifically mortgage and capital markets that have expenses related to missions associated with them and that was one of the reasons for a little higher expense growth.","Terry Dolan","Yes. I think I would just kind of maybe add to that because -- we see that in mortgage and we see that in capital markets specifically, but from an optimization standpoint, we talked about this Investor Day -- very focused on how the customer behaviors are changing making sure that we are staying lockstep with that and I think there is both opportunities in front office from a branch perspective and will continue to look at that and as I said, we may accelerate or increase you know some of the activity associated with that, but it's going to be tight what happens from a customer standpoint. And then you know as we continue to move to a digital platform I think there is back-office opportunities in terms of optimization.","And then the other thing in this kind of gets back to the digital activities that Andy was talking about, we're making important investments in all of our lines of businesses and we want to and will continue to do that because it's important for us to look both short-term as well long-term so.","Matt O'Connor","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I just -- I think sometimes we're also focused on the absolute level of operating leverage and the fact of matter is 80 bps of operating leverage with 4% revenue growth is a lot better than 1% plus operating leverage with 1% revenue growth just the way the math works so. Okay. That\u2019s right. Thank you.","Terry Dolan","Yeah. No, that\u2019s right. And -- that 0.8 positive operating leverage on 54 -- efficiency ratio 54 is a lot different than 1% on 62. So, -- it's all of those things, part of it as the starting point.","Andy Cecere","Thanks Matt.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez","Hey, good morning, guys. So, you guys addressed -- a lot of my questions. I was going to ask you to speak to some of the loan growth trends which are pretty pronounced not only in terms of the absolute level balance sheet growth, but just a mix with commercial on an end-of-period basis commercial going 3% and consumer 7% even with home equity declining for the core even faster than that.","So, I guess a couple of parts though -- maybe you can adjust how much of that growth is related to exogenous factors? Or is dependent on a strong macro environment continuing how much of growth is a function of things you're doing at the company level to deepen relationships used analytics and whatnot?","And I guess the second part of my question though is around CCEL and whether -- do you guys even -- to you guys consider the impact of CCEL when addressing this growth because a lot of the growth is occurring in lending segments that are going to be disproportionally impacted by CCEL in longer term -- longer weighted average lives in higher loss content like cards.","And you I think yourself Terry mentioned at Investor Day that you will have higher ALLL -- to maintain that ALLL ratio, you have to provision more, but with this mix shift that ALLL ratio will continue to migrate upwards and is that something you guys think about or do you guys just say that hey that's accounting noise in the economics of this lending activity is the same, it doesn't really matter and over the life of the loan, the loss is the loss. So, just kind of whether -- the CCEL impact on your growth is something you guys think about and how we should think about in terms of modeling it?","Andy Cecere","Good question. And like -- we kind of talk a little bit about this in the past, when we think about loan growth and where it comes from and kind of our focus within the company. You already think about it more on an economic basis than we do on the accounting. But I do think there's a lot of accounting noise that occurs within CCEL for a lot of different reasons. One is that every company is going to have their own forecasts with respect to what happens in the economy and all the things that we talked about. So, we really think about it more from an economic standpoint.","In terms of loan growth, again just comes back in terms of what we're seeing today and what we see today is that consumer happen to be strong and consumer spend is strong and those things should tend for good growth from a consumer perspective. Even on the business side that while it may moderate, it's still a very solid business. So some of it is driven by macroeconomic, other especially as we kind of think out on a longer-term basis is driven by initiatives.","We started ABS lending sort of platform a year ago, but this focus and Andy talked about it, we have merchants and the merchant side of the equation and small businesses and there is a significant opportunity for us to build leverage both. So when you think about loan growth, we also begin to tighten some of our initiatives.","Saul Martinez","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.","Terry Dolan","Thanks.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Terry Dolan","Good morning, Gerard.","Andy Cecere","Hey, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning guys. You guys have been very good at sharing with us the competition in Commercial Real Estate lending and what's going on in different loan markets. We hear from many of the smaller commercial banks that they're building out there treasury management products. Are you guys seeing any increased competition in that part of the commercial customer base that you deal with that gives us products?","Terry Dolan","Gerard, I would say it's not any different than we've seen historically. I would say probably the change is occurring to treasury management. You continue to see it going forward is the migration and the use case is really the real-time payments that have been developed and the new products and services as a result of that. So, I think that is going to continue to be a change and as you think about our capabilities in treasury management combined with our corporate payments, I think you're going to continue to see those things coming together and changing with this new rails that have been developed.","Gerard Cassidy","And do you think -- speaking on that Andy, do you think Zelle will play a role on that and a go forward basis as Zelle goes from a P2P to possibly a B2B?","Andy Cecere","Well, Zelle, we\u2019ll start to use those new rails as a component of their mechanism, for sure that\u2019s one. Number two, is I think Zelle has a lot of opportunity for growth in different aspects and there are also used cases, request for payment and other things there in the Zelle side. So you\u2019re going to see changes on the business to business side related to the real-time rails. You\u2019re going to see continued migration and changes and enhancement on the consumer side related to Zelle and at some point, some of those things particularly small business may come together a little bit.","Gerard Cassidy","Great.","Terry Dolan","Yeah, and the other thing Gerard, I would just say is that, I think the challenge or the competitive landscape is going to be one based upon who is able to make the investments in connecting the rail -- real-time rail or Zelle or where we made the case to the customer. And that's where our area of focus has really been around the used case is that creates a value proposition to the customer and that investment is very important, it\u2019s an area of focus for us.","Andy Cecere","That's absolutely right. Thank you.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. And then to pivot, you guys have been very conservative in your construction lending; the portfolio is about $10.7 billion down, just under 5% on a year-over-year basis, but there seems to be recently a resurgence in housing, today the National Association of Home Builders there market index rose bidding and consensus and there seems to be recently some pickup in activity here. Are you guys seeing that in any of your markers and are there opportunities for you to capture some of that growth?","A \u2013 Terry Dolan","Gerard, we have a housing capital group that does focus on home builders and we are seeing good growth there -- there West Coast and South principally is where our focus area is, and that -- that business is doing well on growing.","Some of the other aspects of Commercial Real Estate and some of the declines you're seeing are really a function of some of the credit components that we're seeing our competitors move to that we're not comfortable with. So yes, some positives, but we have some negatives and we're sticking with our core customers and within the credit box that we participate in.","Q \u2013 Gerard Cassidy","Great. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.","A \u2013 Terry Dolan","Thank you. All right.","Operator","And there are no further audio questions. Are there any closing remarks?","Jen Thompson","Yes. Thank you for listening to our earnings call and please call the Investor Relations Department if you have any follow-up questions. That concludes our call.","Operator","And thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Kathy Rogers, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session.","This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon Eastern Time through Wednesday, April 27th at 12 midnight.","I would now turn the conference over to Jen Thompson of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.","Jennifer Ann Thompson - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Melissa and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Kathy Rogers, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's first quarter results and to answer your questions. Richard and Kathy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release, and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Richard.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jen and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. I'll begin a review of the U.S. Bank's results with a summary of the quarter's highlights on slide 3 of the presentation.","U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $1.4 billion for the first quarter of 2016, or $0.76 per diluted common share. As a reminder, at the end of 2015, we announced that U.S. Bank became the exclusive issuer of the Fidelity Investments Rewards Card program and as part of that arrangement we purchased the existing card portfolio of $1.6 billion which is reflected in the company's average loan growth for the quarter.","I'm very pleased with our first quarter results. Once again, we delivered industry-leading profitability. Our average loan growth exceeded the high end of our 1% to 1.5% range and the payments business remained strong. Total average loans grew 1.6% on a linked quarter basis and 5.2% year over year, adjusted for the retail card acquisition. Total average deposit growth remained strong, growing 6.3% over the previous year, which included consumer net new account growth of 3.2%. We were affected by a broader market condition, most notably related to the energy sector.","While our energy portfolio is a relatively small portion of our company's overall loan portfolio at 1.3% of total loans, the deterioration in this sector has impacted certain credit metrics. This has resulted in a recognition of additional reserves of $15 million higher than charge-offs during the first quarter. I'd like to highlight that excluding the energy portfolio, credit quality for the company remained strong, which was reflected by our stable charge-off rates. Net charge-offs as a percentage of total average loans were 48 basis points, up one basis point from the prior quarter.","Additionally, the company saw improvement in nonperforming assets, excluding the energy portfolio. Although the company's total nonperforming assets increased 12.9% over the prior quarter, nonperforming assets, excluding the energy portfolio improved 4.1%, reflecting the improvements particularly in our retail portfolios. For instance, residential mortgages continue to benefit from improving real estate values, which has helped to partially offset the increase in the energy loan reserve.","Slide 4 provides you with a five-quarter history of our profitability metrics, which continue to be among the best in the industry. Moving to the graph on the right, this quarter's net interest margin of 3.06% was unchanged from the prior quarter as expected. The benefit we recognized from the increase in short-term rates was offset by the continued shift in our loan portfolio mix. Our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 54.6%, relatively stable from a year ago and up from the fourth quarter as expected due to the seasonality of our businesses. We expect our efficiency ratio to remain in the low-50s going forward as we continue to balance decisions about operating costs with investments in our franchise.","We remain focused on our efficiency efforts as they provide opportunity to invest in our businesses and in technology to meet our customers' needs. For example, during the first quarter, we launched real-time person-to-person payments on the clearXchange network and we continue to invest in enhancements in our mobile banking application. We were pleased to be named as \"Mobile Leader\" by Corporate Insight in March, which acknowledges our commitment to being a leader in the rapidly changing landscape of banking technology.","Turning to slide 5. The company reported total revenue of $5 billion in the first quarter, a $131 million or 2.7% increase from the prior year. The revenue growth we are seeing is primarily being driven by core loan growth, as well as strength in a number of our fee-based businesses, including our payments business.","Kathy will now provide you with more details about the first quarter results.","Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Richard. Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on slide 6. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $12 billion, or 5.2%, compared with the first quarter of 2015 and grew 1.6% on a linked quarter basis, both adjusted for the retail card acquisition.","In the first quarter, the increase in average loans outstanding on a year-over-year basis was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans of 10.2%. Consumer loans again showed positive momentum, led by credit card growth of 13.6% year-over-year, which included the retail card acquisition. Residential mortgage loan growth was also strong, increasing $2.8 billion, or 5.4%, year-over-year, and finally, the momentum in our home equity portfolio continued, resulted in a year-over-year increase of $471 million, or 3%.","On a linked quarter basis, our core loan growth of 1.6%, excluding the card acquisition, was again driven by total commercial loan growth of $3 billion, or 3.5%, the strongest linked quarter growth for the previous five quarters, and growth in residential mortgages of $1.2 billion, or 2.3%.","We currently expect linked quarter average loan growth to approximate 1.5% in the second quarter. Total average deposits increased $17 billion, or 6.3%, compared with the first quarter of 2015 and were up modestly on a linked quarter basis. The linked quarter growth in the first quarter of every year is affected by seasonal factors, notably in our Corporate Trust business line. On a year-over-year basis, the trend continues to show strong growth in non-interest bearing deposits and low cost interest checking. Money market and savings deposits also remained strong year-over-year, more than offsetting the run-off in higher cost time deposits.","Let me now turn to slide 7. As Richard mentioned, challenges in the energy sector affected some of our credit metrics in the first quarter. However, credit quality in the core portfolio, excluding energy, remained stable. First quarter net charge-offs increased $36 million, or 12.9%, compared with the prior year. Net charge-offs were $10 million, or 3.3% higher than the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans were 48 basis points in the first quarter, up one basis point compared with the fourth quarter. Compared with a year ago, non-performing assets increased 1.4%. On a linked quarter basis, non-performing assets increased by 12.9%. The increases were entirely (7:55-7:57) energy-related credits. Excluding energy-related loans, non-performing assets decreased 4.1% on a linked quarter basis.","Turning to slide 8, let me now provide some additional color around our energy exposure. At the end of the first quarter, approximately $3.4 billion of our commercial loans were to customers in energy-related businesses. Energy-related loans are 1.3% of our total loans. Our energy loan commitments were $11.9 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2016, down slightly on both a year-over-year and linked quarter basis. During the quarter, we recognized $138 million of reserves related to the energy portfolio, and the reserve for energy loan now stands at 9.1% of outstanding balances at the end of the first quarter of 2016. This compares with a 5.4% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015.","Finally, approximately 43% of our energy commitments, and 17% of our outstanding energy loans, are to investment grade companies. Given the underlying mix in quality of the overall portfolio, we currently expect linked quarter net charge-offs and total provision expense to be relatively stable in the second quarter of 2016.","Slide 9 gives you a view of our first quarter results versus comparable periods. First quarter net income decreased by $45 million, or 3.1%, on a year-over-year basis. Improvement in operating income was offset by higher loan loss provision and higher income taxes. The higher tax rate was primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters that benefited tax expense in the first quarter of 2015. On a linked quarter basis, net income declined by $90 million, or 6.1%, mainly due to seasonality in some of our businesses, an increase in the provision for credit loss due to energy, and the impact of the previously reported fourth quarter 2015 gain on the sale of the Health Savings Account deposit portfolio.","Turning to slide 10, net interest income increased by $136 million, or 4.9% on a year-over-year basis. Strong average earning asset growth was offset by the impact of a two basis point decline in net interest margin to 3.06%. The modest year-over-year decline in margin percentage primarily reflected the impact of higher short-term rates, offset by loan mix shift and lower reinvestment rates in the security portfolio.","Net interest income increased by $17 million, or 0.6% on a linked quarter basis. Growth in average earning assets and the impact of higher short-term rates were partially offset by the impact of fewer days in the quarter. We currently expect net interest margin in the second quarter to be relatively stable, and linked quarter net interest income to increase modestly.","Slide 11 highlights non-interest income, which decreased $5 million, or 0.2% year-over-year. The year-over-year decrease in non-interest income was primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue, partially offset by higher payments revenue and higher trust and investment management fees. Continued strength in the payment business is reflected in our results. Credit and debit card revenue grew by $25 million, or 10.4%, reflecting higher transaction volumes, including the acquired portfolio. Sales volumes, excluding the impact of the credit card portfolio acquisition, were up 6.4% year-over-year, an improvement from the 6% year-over-year growth delivered in the fourth quarter.","Merchant processing services revenue increased by $14 million, or 3.9%. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency rate changes, year-over-year merchant processing services revenue growth would have been approximately 6.4%. The growth was driven by higher transaction volumes, account growth, and equipment sales to merchants related to new chip and card technology requirements. Equipment sales related to chip card technology continue to trend modestly lower versus growth reported in prior periods. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest income was lower by $191 million, or 8.2%, principally due to seasonally lower fee-based revenues along with the impact of the fourth quarter HSA deposit sale.","As expected, our payment fees and deposit service charges declined due to seasonality in those businesses. Mortgage banking revenues also declined as expected, principally due to lower rates impacting the valuation of our mortgage servicing rights. We expect linked quarter mortgage fees to increase 10 to 20% based on seasonally higher application volumes.","Moving to slide 12, non-interest expense was $84 million or 3.2% higher on a year-over-year basis. Higher compensation expense, primarily driven by merit increases and higher compliance and acquisition costs were partially offset by lower pension expense and an insurance recovery recognized during the quarter. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense decreased by $60 million, or 2.1%. Seasonally lower costs related to investments in tax-advantaged projects and lower professional services expenses along with the insurance recovery were partially offset by seasonally higher benefits expense and higher variable compensation. The variable compensation expense includes costs related to an all-employee grant that was issued in the first quarter.","We expect linked quarter expenses to increase in quarter two, driven by expected seasonality and higher expenses related to our brand positioning that was launched in the first quarter. Additionally, we expect professional services related to compliance to peak in the second quarter and then modestly decline, as costs related to our residential mortgage default consent order conclude. Our efficiency ratio is expected to decline slightly in the second quarter.","Turning to slide 13, as Richard mentioned, our capital position remains strong and in the first quarter, we returned 80% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We expect to remain in our 60% to 80% range going forward.","Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as fully implemented at March 31st was 9.2%, which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to 17.94 at March 31st, representing an 8.7% increase over the same quarter of last year, and a 2.9% increase over the prior quarter.","I will now turn the call back to Richard.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Kathy. I'm very proud of our first quarter results. We maintained our industry-leading performance measures and we reported an 18% return on tangible common equity in the quarter. We continue to operate from a position of strength as we grow our revenue and manage expenses, while strategically investing in our businesses to create value for our shareholders. While not immune to the broader economic and market conditions, including the continued low rate environment and the weakness in the energy sector, we are confident in our ability to manage through these challenges, to win market share, and continue to deliver consistent, predictable, and repeatable financial results for the benefit of our customers, our employees, and our shareholders.","That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Kathy, Bill, and I would now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. I had two questions. One was on the real-time payments that you launched this past quarter. Richard, we have been talking quite a bit over the past several conference calls around the efforts underway to drive real-time payments. And you promised and delivered on the expectation this year that we would have something big come. Could you give us a sense as to how you expect to utilize this product, how you expect to deliver real-time payments, not only to consumers but also to corporates as we work through what ACH is going to be doing and also what clearXchange is driving for you?","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, Betsy. Yeah, the clearXchange and the EWS (16:04) partnership which you've read about with some of the large banks has been a important step to get us into a combined effort so that we can all work on something that banks have controlled for years, which is the payments network and the ACH system. So we're making progress. And I think as an industry, you'd be proud that we haven't lost our position. We haven't given it up and we are not going to sit idly by while nonbanks come in and take over the position.","So the first couple of products you saw, some from us, are \u2013 is just a peek into the future. I will tell you that the appetite for the consumers is higher than for business on some of these higher value products because they are eager to change and try new things and businesses are more cautious and more careful and think blockchain, moving from ledger to eventually payments and things like that. So we are pleased with what we see.","The issue I want to bring before you though and our investors is, whether you get paid for this? And there's already a bit of a discord between us and the other bank that came out with one of the real-time payments P2P where we are charging for it and they are not. And so the issue we have to ask ourselves is, will consumers and eventually businesses pay for a circumstance that they don't have value for today? Will they pay it for a time? (17:22) Amazon member and you will pay for Prime to have certain privileges and speed. They'll do it there, so we are hoping they will do it here in the payments world.","We have to make sure that the business of banking doesn't become a utility in the minds of the consumers where they expect everything to come without a value price to it. And we are hoping that we'll be able to help set the standard for that. But that's my hope. And then there'll be plenty more opportunities to hear what consumers and the businesses want delivered to them. And frankly, I think we'll surprise them. But it's been so long, this whole paradigm of overnight settlement, closed on weekends and all of that. I think they will be quite pleased to see some of the progress we are making.","I'd like to ask Andy to give a little more color on it since he's overseeing all of our performance in real-time payments and helping coordinate our own banks' position on that.","Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer","Thanks, Richard. Betsy, I'd add two facts. One is, the current P2P is principally consumer-to-consumer and it's principally on a mobile device. And what you'll see as we continue through this year is that more and more banks will be added to that network, so would be able to continue real-time exchange with other additional banks.","Secondly, on the wholesale or business-to-business side of the equation, you will see more of that activity come later this year as we continue to develop other capabilities beyond consumer and, again, I expect that to be later this year.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","On the payment question with NACHA moving to same-day settlement in October for push transactions, does that reduce the risk that you take as an institution and have an impact on the fees you are charging?","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, it doesn't. It's all part of this larger consortium of getting everybody aligned properly. The ACH is owned in part by the clearing house and in part by the Fed. NACHA is one of the partners that we all deal with. And I am happy to report, we are all working and playing well together so that we don't create confusion or what I will call price disintermediation on what would otherwise be something we want to keep simple for the customer. So add NACHA to the stable of partners that we are working with in getting this, I think, right in the minds of both the consumers and what investors would want us to do.","Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer","And what that does is essentially add an additional window. So it's not really real-time per se, but it's an additional window during the day.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just wondering if there is also a benefit to you from this product in terms of account acquisition and expense management, more real-time pay over the mobile, less check, less cash?","Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer","Certainly there is a lower expense from that and I think the principal reason we are doing is though is from a customer experience standpoint. So, customers who have the need to have a real-time exchange for whatever reason would have that capability on their phone and again, we are one of the first to introduce that. So that's what it's about; it's how the customer is interacting with the bank and with other individuals.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I do think there will be an advantage to the banks that go first and there will be a window, like anything else where you can attract other customers who don't know that their bank will ever have it. This will become ubiquitous over time, which, at the end of the day is okay as long as the industry finds the right value proposition and gets paid for it.","And to go back to your question, to add a little business to business on here, where Andy mentioned on NACHA. Give yourself an example of, you are a state of whatever, and in the middle of the day, you realize you made a mistake on one of your payrolls to your state employees and you need to remedy that before tomorrow morning. There is opportunities now to get in the middle of the payment system and do something midday. But I think that should have a cost to it, because that's a convenience that was otherwise not present for value of services added. So I think we will find some, both competitive benefits and some financial benefits, but it has a lot to do with how the industry performs in the next, probably three to four quarters as we start rolling things out.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Matt.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Can you talk a bit about how far along you are in some of the system spend and related investments you are making, and then weave that into kind of maybe the longer term outlook for expenses? You gave us some visibility on 2Q, but as we think about the back half of the year and just maybe get towards the end of the ramp in that spend, how that plays out.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I will go first. System spend, if you mean technology and operations, that's steady state. If you take a ten-year view \u2013 my ten years at least, the first five were higher than what I will say is the run rate, because we were trying to catch up, and you know that story, and we did that. And now we are back to a steady state. I'd say the next few years, there won't be a significant difference in depreciated costs, capital expenditures. They are higher than they used to be, because we need to stay at that level. But we've also never cheated the innovation and technology piece in any of those years to have to either catch up or to either ramp down. So our expenses are going to move more likely on the cost of personnel attached with compliance-related activities, which we said will peak in this quarter that we are in. And it's (22:19) rely on just the fact that we are going to continue to have to pay up for making sure that employees have the proper level of compensation. Think of all the minimum wage issues that are out there and issues like that. So that's going to drive a big part of our expenses. Technology will be at the run rate it is now and it's going to be very thoughtful, but we're going to continue to apply the efficiency we get in one side of it to the opportunity for innovation costs on the other. But I don't think we will add it as a save in the future.","Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, and I would add, our area of focus is in three principal areas. Number one is customer relationship management. So, better information about our customers, both across the retail as well as the wholesale platform. Second is customer capability. So, increasing what a customer can do, not only within a branch, but on their mobile device, as well as on the Internet. And finally, data; data overall. Just using data better in the company for the benefit of the bank as well as the customer.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I guess as we roll out beyond 2Q, just I mean, how meaningful is getting the peak and compliance costs behind you? And what I'm getting at is, obviously, you are extremely efficient, industry-leading, but we are in such a low revenue growth environment, 3% expense growth just makes it tough to consistently grow earnings. So trying to get a sense of, how much more you can do on the expense and efficiency side, from already it's a turning point (23:39).","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I got it. Let's go back and do a quick fact set (23:42). We are two parts revenue, one part expenses, is our recipe; that's good. So when revenue does move, it's got a two-fer on expenses. We only expect one more interest rate increase in the second half of the year in order for us to accomplish what we pretty much telegraphed to all of you. And if it doesn't, it won't be Armageddon, but it would be something we hope to get.","In response to that, expenses, the compliance costs are something that we don't like, because they are related to expectations that we didn't have for ourselves. So if there's a consent order, it means you have been deficit in some way. One of the ways to fix that is to bring in both third parties and to bulk up your staffing. And then you come back down to a more normalized level.","I will say, our compliance costs and FTE have really nearly tripled in the last five years. We did that review for our board just yesterday. And I would have said probably two-thirds of that would have been present anyway, consent orders or not. So it's not like, just an order peaks you out and you never come back down. But there is a run rate impact. So as we finish the mortgage consent order, this quarter wraps up and its completion, and then we move into now the AML\/BSA consent order that we are moving through, that's where I think we are peaking out. This is the overlap quarter.","But coming down, Matt, we are talking tens of millions of dollars; we are not talking hundreds of millions of dollars. We're talking hundreds of FTE, not thousands of FTE. It's really more a settling kind of a moment. Probably more germane to that is, as long as we can grow our loans at I think the kind of level we have been, high quality loans \u2013 I can say that twice; high quality loans, because that's an issue now, and we can outrun that even if margin stays flat. And with that two-to-one on expenses, we can grow expenses and grow revenue and still have positive operating leverage, and we are still shooting for it for 2016, and we can still make money.","The challenge I have is whether I want to dispense any of those efficiency saves back into the bank, or whether I want to steal them away and put them to the bottom line, and we are doing both. And so, you will hear in Kathy's comments that we're going to continue to move forward with our reputation and brand strategy and advertising plan, which will cost us probably another $20 million to $25 million in the next quarter. And we're going to stick with it, and we're going to get this thing done and get our story out there as we think it deserves to be told. And that's just a small fraction of the money we've saved on our efficiency program.","And while I'm not going to give you a final number, two years ago in February \u2013 so was that \u2013 26 months ago, we put on the FTE freeze on things that were less important and required. A year ago, we put on the all other watchful eye on other expenses, and that has saved tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars in our annual run rate, most of which we are putting back to you to keep our efficiency where it is, but some of which we're putting back into the company. But as to your original question, we can grow both, and we are thoughtful about it, but we expect that the cost of expenses will be measured more by FTE and the necessary jobs that have to be accomplished, and we will. Anything else certainly isn't going to be technology.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thank you very much.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question is from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Matt.","Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Matt.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, Richard. Thanks for taking my question. First of all, in terms of your guidance on the provision, Kathy, I noted that you think that that's going to be relatively stable quarter-over-quarter. But if I do a little bit of simple math, it looks like, outside of the energy portfolio, you released reserves last quarter, whereas you clearly added reserves in the energy portfolio. First of all, is that correct? And second of all, if we are correct on that, how do you think about the energy portfolio reserving going forward? Is this something where you are just going to sort of cover losses and maintain reserves where they are, or possibly add to reserves going forward?","P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer","Hi, Matt. This is Bill Parker. I'll take that. You're correct.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, Bill.","P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer","We did have continued improvement, particularly in our residential mortgage portfolio, so that did, in part, offset some of the increase to the energy reserves. You can see, we did build the energy reserves to 9.1% of our outstanding loans. We had a pretty conservative price stack that we used during the quarter. So we feel like we have got, embedded in those reserves, what we will need for the future quarters. So, that's where we get that stable outlook.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, that's helpful, Bill, thanks very much. And then, if I can, just on the expenses, a little ticky-tack question. Have you disclosed the amount of the proceeds from the insurance recovery? Because we would, I think, deem that as sort of a one-off or non-core, but just curious if you provided that?","Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Yeah, Matt, what I would say, we didn't disclose it. It's really not material to the numbers.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then just, finally from me, we noted a higher money market savings rate this quarter versus the fourth quarter. Can you provide some color on what was going on there?","Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I think a lot of where you see in the money market account are going to be some of our deposits with some of our corporate customers. So as our short-term rates started to increase, we did see a little bit of pricing increase on the commercial side or the wholesale side. I will say that from a consumer side of the house, we have really seen no changes in our overall deposit pricing.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks very much for taking my questions.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Your next question is from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Jon.","Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Jon.","Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning, everyone. A question on your loan growth guidance. High end of the range, you obviously did pretty well this quarter. And with the flat margin, it actually suggests maybe a little better revenue environment. But can you just give us an idea of the drivers that are putting you at the high end of that range? And then maybe, Bill, if you could comment on what you expect on energy draws. Do you expect energy loan balances to kind of up, down, sideways? Thanks.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Jon, first of all, we telegraphed to you guys 1.5% for quarter two, which, read between the lines, we have moved up the bottom, right? So we already know what quarter two is starting to look like, and it's feeling pretty robust. And it's very much the same things have you seen. Commercial is still strong and growing at that same clip, particularly M&A transactions or balance restructurings by corporate customers. We have got nice growth in home equity. I know that's a very rare thing, but we continue to grow our home equity portfolio I think against the comps to the other banks. Auto continues to grow. Credit card continues to grow. So we are on all cylinders on loans. Mortgages particularly are growing nicely as they \u2013 they didn't a year ago. So we are feeling good across the board. And I would say, what you have seen in the last four quarters is \u2013 would be a lot of what you see in the next quarter or two. So we are telegraphing strong.","We also said that net interest income will be up slightly or modestly because we do expect a stable margin, increasing balance sheet. That gives you a slight positive. Margin is too early to know and we have to watch and see all the moving parts, so 'stable' just means it's close to where it is now, but we don't know yet at this point which direction or flat it will be. But we do think net interest income will be strong enough based on the loan growth to at least accomplish a positive linked quarter. As \u2013 energy, I'll turn it over to Bill.","P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer","Yeah, and so on the energy portfolio, we did have a small number of borrowers that did draw during the first quarter. So our loan balances there were up couple hundred million. You can see that our commitments declined. We expected the commitments to continue to decline as we go through the borrowing base re-determinations. Wouldn't surprise me if there were another handful of borrowers that did draw during the quarter, but I can say we've also had a lot of success in \u2013 with other borrowers in restructuring the loans and \u2013 where they have been able to provide additional collateral.","So overall, little up \u2013 probably a little more on the loans and then the commitments will continue to come down.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And we have also done the re-determination.","P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer","Yes, we are about 40% of the way through the borrowing base Spring re-determination so \u2013 and so far that's going pretty well and allows us to feel comfortable about the stable outlook.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. And (32:16) 40% doesn't hurt. One more thing, Jon, I should have added. I didn't talk about commercial real estate. That's flat for us. It's been flat for us. We are different there too. A lot of the banks are growing that a lot. I said in the prior calls that we want to be very watchful on commercial real estate and we are being \u2013 we could be wrong. We could be missing some of the market growth. There's some pockets of good strength and we are in them. We've got our customers who are certainly going to grow the balance sheet, but not by a lot because we are protecting what we have and probably being more careful and not getting into some of the areas and things we don't really understand at this point in time. So add that to your thinking. While loans will still grow, commercial estate would be flattish, protecting the good customers we have.","Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Good. That's very helpful. And then Bill, to clarify, you don't expect another \u2013 if oil stays here, you don't expect another big step-up in energy reserves. Is that the right way to interpret what you said in the last question?","P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer","Correct. Yes.","Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks for the help.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jon.","Operator","Your next question is from Paul Miller with FBR.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Paul.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Yeah, guys, thank you very much. On the energy side, are you seeing any of the areas where those energy credits are going bad; you seeing any deterioration in any of your CRE products or loans?","P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer","Yeah, we look at a couple of our markets that are energy dependent, the ones that we're most focused on are Denver and Houston. Denver, there's been little to no impact. It's not that energy dependent anymore. Houston of course is. We do have commercial real estate down there. We also do home building in the state of Texas. So we are watching that carefully. We have seen stress in the office market. That's obviously slowed in Houston. We do have four properties that we are watching, but it's not a material amount. We underwrite to our sponsors, our client base, as opposed to the area that they are in. So we feel that we have good secondary support on all the credits that we have in Houston.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And, Paul, we look at secondary and tertiary impacts on particularly those markets, the Gulf Coast and things where we have auto loans, we might have credit cards and things and we see absolutely no impact at all at this early stage of the game. So no one who lives or works down there that has our cars our cards are showing any stress.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","And then a follow-up question just on the mortgage side. Are you seeing any big pickup in the purchase market? Are we seeing some indications that the purchase market finally is starting to get some life? On any of your applications for the second quarter, are you seeing any pickup in that?","Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, the mortgage application on the purchase side was up about 12%. And as you know, the refinancings are down, so that's what's causing the overall decline. And I would expect to continue to increase in the second quarter, principally due to the seasonality in that 10% to 20% range.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey, guys. Thank you very much.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks Paul.","Operator","Your next question is from John Pancari with Evercore.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, John.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Good morning. On the C&I loan yield, looks like it was up 11 basis points in the quarter. I just want to get a little bit of color on the drivers of that. I know the Fed hike is certainly part of it. And then, if it's sustainable at that level and what your outlook would be.","Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yes, thanks, John. I am going to say, it's really all driven by the Fed hike \u2013 the increase in the short term. As you know, where we see the increase in \u2013 due to loan rates is going to be in our wholesale portfolio and we get all of that typically in the first \u2013 first 90-day is a little bit more front-loaded. I would not \u2013 unless we see another increase in short-term rates, I would not see that list continuing into second quarter.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We might also just add, we have benefited by deposits not going up quite as much as we thought they would.","Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","That's right.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Okay. Got it. And then on the payments side of the business, wanted to get just your updated thoughts on how we should think about the growth rates in those businesses. Particularly the merchant processing business, up about 4% year-over-year. What's a good growth rate we can assume for that one? And then the same thing around the credit and debit card businesses. Just want to get an idea of what you think in terms of a growth possibility for the year. Thanks.","Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer","So, merchant \u2013 let me start \u2013 this is Andy. Let me start with Merchant. Merchant was up, as you said about 4%; adjusted for FX, about 6.5% and that is \u2013 the principal driver of that growth is going to be same store sales. And same store sales was down a little bit in North America versus Europe for sure maybe about 2% versus 2.5% or so over the last few quarters. So the consumer was a little bit more cautious in the first quarter, spend was a little bit down, but I would expect to continue to have, even at that level's growth in the range \u2013 adjusted again for FX in that 5% to 6% range on a go-forward basis per merchant. On the card side of equation that was a little higher because of the purchase of the Fidelity acquisition that we talked about. If you adjust that out, we are talking at about 6%, 6.5%. And I would expect growth again in that range. That's also going to be driven by same store sales and then what's happening so to speak with what customers are doing. We are seeing modest growth there, but nothing substantial, neither up nor down in that category.","And then finally, you didn't ask but I will just give you the corporate payment side of the equation. Two big moving pieces there. The first is on the government side of the equation, which is actually down almost 6%, 5.7% on a year-over-year basis. That's principally due to defense spending going down. Now, on the flip side of the equation, corporate spend was actually up a bit, almost the exact same amount, 5.7%. And interesting, we are seeing there, while companies continue to be very conservative as it relates to T&E spend, payable spend is actually starting to increase, which is a positive sign.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","All right, Andy. Thank you. That's helpful. And one last thing on energy, what was the percentage borrowing base reduction so far that you have seen in the Spring re-determinations that have been completed?","P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer","The values came down about 20% to 25% and that translates into commitment reductions in our E&P portfolio of about 10% to 15%","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, the 40% re-determination's been accomplished. 75% of the companies had a reduction, 25% did not. So they are not all being reduced, but that takes you down to the numbers that Bill gave you.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Got it. Thank you.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep.","Operator","Your next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Mike.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Hey. This goes in the category of 'no good deed goes unpunished'. Your efficiency ratio remains really good at 54.6%, but it's just not clear how it gets better from where it is. And I would point out, as you know, it's the worst it's been in the last five quarters. You guided higher for expenses in the second quarter. And when I look at the 54.6%, five years ago, it was 51%. So it has drifted up and I hear you, tech, compliance, regulation. So how do you move that lower? And that's my segue into, why not pursue acquisitions, and what is your appetite and when would you be able to pursue those acquisitions?","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well, thanks Debbie Downer for that. You are right; 54% is higher than we have been in a long time. I know you know this, but I'll say it again; we don't set a target; it's a result, because we keep watching our revenue and our expenses and always try to grow revenue over expenses when possible. The 300 basis points in the last few years is not only \u2013 not surprising, but I think it's actually much better than it could have been, given the fact that with a 0% interest rate increase up until last quarter and with a very slow, steady, almost not recovering economy, we obviously have been taking market share of high quality customers and been able to offset some of that margin compression.","So I'm actually pretty pleased with it, but I do think \u2013 we said it's going to be coming down slightly next quarter, so we are telegraphing to you all that this will be our high-water mark for the year. It also was the high-water mark last year. I think it is always the high-water mark as quarter one is by far our weakest quarter. It will come down on that basis. But Mike, when \u2013 two things have to happen, and I don't know which is more valuable. One is that the economy just need to get stronger and we got to be doing old-fashioned lending for people who want to grow and acquire organic kind of things that we haven't done in a long time in this industry. That will be huge.","The second thing will be that we enjoy interest rate increases or a steeper yield curve. They are also both quite important, right? Because interest rates not moving up will harm some of the projections for the industry, but make sure you guys are watching the slope of the curve too, right? As the high end came up \u2013 the moment \u2013 the short end came up, the long end came down. And that has the same kind of impact on interest income that you would see on lack of rate movement. So, nothing has gone in our industry's favor in the last five years to improve an efficiency ratio. So we are holding on for dear life with this effort, that we think we can outrun expense growth by revenue. But I do think that the 54.6% is a high-water mark for us. And we are \u2013 we're not loving it, but we are also \u2013 by the same token, I'm not trying to patronize you guys, give you guys a 52% by suffocating the company and not investing and then living later on to explain myself, two years from now, why we didn't invest and why we didn't make the decisions we should have. So, I like the way you asked the question; there is a possibility for it to get better.","In terms of M&A, we are always interested, particularly in the payments and trust business. You are reminded that, with the AML consent order, we are disallowed from looking at whole bank transactions, and again, it's okay right now, because we haven't found one we wish we could have had, and there's nothing we have lost that we would have otherwise sought. But we want to move through that order as soon as we can so we can get back to the permissions, which I think will be starting next year. And I have said this many times before, where kind of the statute of any oldest limitations should be away and gone from any acquisition, such that when you buy somebody, you know what you are buying and you don't buy old problems that you couldn't have possibly detected in due diligence. So we are still hungry for that. It is not going to make or break this company, because we are not going to change who we are or the mix of business, but we are always on the lookout for very good opportunities, the fidelity of the (42:40) portfolio, the Auto Club portfolio, you will see more of those, and hopefully more merchant portfolios, particularly overseas.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","As a follow-up, on looking at whole bank deals, so you can't even look. I mean, could you \u2013 when do you think you'd be able to look at whole bank deals, and what sort of merger criteria do you have in terms of IRR or accretion, dilution? I know you haven't done a big bank deal in a while, but it seems like you are a more efficient bank, makes sense to buy a less efficient bank. That's the way the industry is supposed to evolve.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's the old fashioned way of doing it. And not just for expenses, but for revenue, right? I would say, first of all, we have \u2013 there's a firm prohibition on buying a holding company while you have an AML consent order. You saw us buy branches before and you've seen us take on portfolios, those are the rules that are a little less clear, and we haven't found anything to test it. So, again, we are not being thwarted at the gate here. But what you would want to do is, once we get through the consent order, we will be back into the market and looking at those opportunities. But I got to tell you, the reason I haven't signed anything we like is because this company isn't thirsting for any unfinished business. There is not a market we're in that we don't want to be in, and there is not a market we are dying to get in that we are not. I would actually rather double down where we are.","And the fact of the matter is, I'm still very concerned, for all kinds of reasons, that to pick up any full company, even if I could, I probably wouldn't right now, because I still think there's a lingering impact of attorneys generals and SECs and all kinds of other actions that are still yet to be levied on some of the smaller banks as we move down through that cycle, and I don't want to be holding one of them when we get there. But I'd tell you, as soon as the AML thing gets cleared and our regulators are quite clear that we want to clear whatever parts of that particular order would allow us back into bank transactions, we are making that job one, so that we have all the alternatives available to us as soon as possible.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","And do you think you can clear that by the end of this year?","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't know when that's going to clear, because they take a long time. That's why I bifurcated and said we are seeking permissions to get the part of it that would allow us back into the M&A, full M&A business, to be accomplished first, and as long as the regulators will allow that, then we can bifurcate the full exit (44:51) by getting to the pieces that matter the most. And that's what we are working on, and as you would expect, the regulators haven't given us a timetable, and I wouldn't be dumb enough to guess at this stage, but that's what we are working on.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you.","Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer","Yes.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Your next question is from Jack Micenko with SIG.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Jack.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey, good morning. Richard, you guys have been a leader in the payment space for a long time, and obviously very focused on competing against the non-banks. I'm curious what your thoughts are personally and then broadly, U.S. Bank's strategy, around the peer-to-peer side. Obviously, a lot of investor tension in that space. There's some structural differences for sure. We have seen some banks partner, we have seen some banks buy loans. Give us your thoughts on how that evolves, and how you see U.S. Bank fitting in.","Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer","Jack, this is Andy. Hey. You are absolutely right. It's a topic of a lot of focus for our company. What I would say is, we are very comfortable with our underwriting process and use of our balance sheet. I think where some of the \u2013 Vintac (45:55) and other companies have done a good job is the customer interaction, customer convenience and access. And so, if there's a partnership, that's where we would focus, is on that end of the equation, not the underwriting end. And we are actually looking at different opportunities there in experimentation, in terms of improving the customer experience, which I think they have done a pretty good job on. But we are very comfortable with our underwriting. It's proven through cycles, and we're going to stick with that.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. Thank you.","Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer","Yes.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jack.","Operator","Your next question is from Richard Bove with Rafferty Capital Markets.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Dick.","Dick X. Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. I would like to explore for a second your relationship with the Minneapolis Fed. I mean, I'm guessing that you are a member, and that you probably provide about 50% of the revenue of that Federal Reserve Bank. And that Bank has published formulas, I guess, which would suggest that you are too big to fail, and that your bank should be broken up. And I'm wondering, number one, what your interaction is with that bank. Number two, did you have any say in the selection of the President of that bank? And most importantly, number three, does it become an embarrassment for the Minneapolis Fed if you acquire anything or if you grow, forcing them to make some sort of statement against U.S. Bancorp in order to maintain the purity of their message, which could cause some problem for you guys? I mean, if you wouldn't mind just exploring the idea with us.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would be happy to. Thanks for the question. First of all, our relationship is quite good. We are, by far, their most important client, and we're, I think, more than half the entire Ninth District. As you all probably know, but I will remind you that the hiring of the President is left to a layman board, particularly, local leaders who have parameters, of course. But they do bring in people that have \u2013 in some cases, they are not economists, and Neel Kashkari certainly fits that bill. But he comes in with a zeal and a need to want to open the question again on too-big-to-fail. I have met with him. I knew him in the TARP program. As you recall, we were the last big bank to take TARP. I didn't want to. We were the first bank to pay it back. I'm glad we did. I had long conversations with him over that period of time. And as soon as he showed up, Dick, here in the first of the year, Andy and I went to meet with him to introduce ourselves in his new role, and we had a very good conversation. And I believe \u2013 and I can say that the Fed here and we have a working relationship that couldn't be better than it is anywhere else.","So that as a backdrop, I don't think he's coming in with his gunsights on U.S. Bank. In fact, I'm sure he's not. We have not \u2013 he's not invited any banks to his symposiums yet. He hasn't indicated yet when that will be, but I know we will have that opportunity. You might guess, I have private conversations with him routinely and with his team, so I'm not feeling left out of being able to offer my thoughts on some of his considerations. But at the end of the day, I'm going to take him to his word. But he's \u2013 while he has a bent towards investigating too big to fail, he is going to collect a lot of good data, and I think he's going to be balanced in his final decision. He's committed publicly to have a recommendation to the Fed by year's end, on what he thinks could be done to improve the safety and soundness of banks. At these early stages, he's focused on capital, he's focused on size. But I think he'll have to spend the rest of the year bringing in all kinds of different parties to speak, including Bernanke, who is coming May 16, at his second symposium.","So I'm not feeling that he's set himself up yet to suggest that U.S. Bank is in his gunsights. I don't think any actions we take would be either harmful to him, nor I think affected by his opinion. As you know, the local Fed has a lot of jurisdiction over its banks, but a great deal of things like the stress test and the horizontal incentive compensation (49:35) rules and things are also managed at the Washington level, along with the locals. So our relationship with Washington, which is quite good, and local, is important to me, and I want to make sure that we are all operating in transparency.","So, at this point, I appreciate his approach. I welcome people coming with ideas. I'm certainly sharing my thoughts when I have the opportunity. It would be inappropriate, I think, for me to take a public position and argue the merits of going out and collecting more feedback, and there probably are some \u2013 number of pundits that do believe that banks need to continue to be safer and more sound. I think we have accomplished an amazing level of success there, and I think a bank our size is exactly the kind of size that most people can get their arms around. I can get my arms around this one, and I'm going to continue to proffer that this is the perfect sized bank. Kind of the Goldilocks of banks. But I'm welcoming his new ideas and his energy, but I'm not short on having the opportunity to share my thoughts with him. Just simply not in a public forum.","Dick X. Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thank you very much.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Vivek.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking my questions. Hi. Can you hear me?","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, go ahead.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, you can. A couple of questions. First, a simple one. What's the percentage of criticized loans for energy? You gave commitments. Can you give loans also, please?","P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer","Yeah, I do have that with me. So, when I \u2013 you ask your other question and I'll get back to it, okay?","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Second question is on the credit card charge volume. As I look at \u2013 you had obviously very good increase in volumes from the Fidelity acquisition, but when you look at fees, the growth was much lesser (51:20). So, clearly, a sharp drop in pricing. Can you talk a little bit about how you came up with a pricing on the Fidelity deal? Because it seems like your average fee rate is down pretty sharply year-over-year when you look at that.","Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer","The Fidelity portfolio, Vivek, is a higher quality portfolio. It is a lower charge-off rate portfolio. A higher spend portfolio, and a little lower rate portfolio, as you said. But it's very profitable overall, and we are very comfortable with the pricing that's there. The only thing I'd say on pricing is, the impact has also been impacted by gasoline prices as they come down, and you will see a little bit of a reduction there. But the Fidelity portfolio is actually a very good portfolio for the bank, overall. Higher quality, a little bit restructure than what we had in the quarter.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Andy.","Andrew J. Cecere - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer","Sure.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And, Bill, do you have a number?","P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer","Yeah. 52%.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Can you talk a little bit about that? That's pretty high, given that you have been a pretty cautious lender, and you'd been small in that portfolio. Can you talk about why you are at one of the highest levels?","P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer","I can, because core to how we rate those loans is our price deck. And our price deck, we feel is \u2013 we like it. It's conservative. That's the way we like to do things. So our price deck right now is at $30 throughout 2016, and it slowly goes up over the next five years to $44. So, I think if you look at any of the futures markets, you will see that that's a fairly conservative outlay. And that is how we risk weight our loans.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Okay. Thank you.","P. W. Parker - Vice Chairman & Chief Risk Officer","Yeah.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Vivek.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Mahmood Reza with Omega Advisors.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Mahmood.","Mahmood Reza - Omega Advisors, Inc.","Hey there. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one going back to the student loan portfolio, which I think, last year we went held for sale in Q1 and then back to held for investment in Q3. There were sort of a few transactions and it seems like that market has thawed in the first quarter. And I would be curious to get your view if you think it's sort of thawed enough to get you interested in testing the waters again. And as a follow-up, does sort of the move from held for sale to available for sale and back to held for sale last year in the span of three quarters limit your ability to sell the portfolio again this year? Thank you.","Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Thank you, Mahmood. We said last year when we moved that portfolio back into our held for investment that we were going to stick with that. We are not really looking at any opportunities to move on that again. So I would expect, going forward, that you'll just continue to see that in our loan portfolio.","Mahmood Reza - Omega Advisors, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Your final question comes from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Marty.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Hey. I wanted to ask about the seasonality. If you take out mortgage, which you gave us some good insight into what you thought was going to happen there. But you have strong seasonality from first \u2013 second quarters in a lot of the processing businesses. Typically, that's in the 6% to 7% uptick. Just wanted to see if \u2013 is that kind of the same progression you are looking for this year.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yes.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Perfect. And then...","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, sorry...","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","...that comes through loud and clear. That then is, if you look at the efficiencies improving, even with the uptick and some expenses, you really will set, after you have kind of had to work through a couple of years of relatively flat earnings, this will be a nice step-up, which you typically get seasonally. So, I just would expect to see that, and was wondering if that's kind of in line if you bring it all together.","Kathy Ashcraft Rogers - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I will say that. So if we \u2013 I will go back to the efficiency questions that have been asked. I do think that's exactly right. So we are going to have an increase in our fee \u2013 or on our revenues from a seasonality standpoint. But I think as importantly as our loan growth continues to pick up at the higher end of the range, that's going to add additional revenue and the fact that our margin has stabilized is really \u2013 is helping us from an overall standpoint of being comfortable thinking about the efficiency ratio, declining a little bit as we move into the second quarter.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Perfect. Thanks.","Richard K. Davis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Marty.","Operator","And there are no further questions.","Richard K.

[Operator Instructions].","This call will be recorded and available for replay, beginning today at approximately noon, Eastern Standard Time, through Wednesday 23 at 12:00 midnight, Eastern Standard Time.","I'll now turn the conference call over to Jenn Thompson of Investor Relations of U.S. Bancorp.","Jenn Thompson","Thank you, Kirk, and good morning to everyone who's joined our call. Andy Cecere and Terry Dolan are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's fourth quarter results and to answer your questions.","Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.","I'd like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.","I'll now turn the call over to Andy.","Andrew Cecere","Thanks, Jen, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry and I will open the call up to Q&A.","I'll begin on Slide 3, which provides financial highlights for the fourth quarter. We reported earnings per share of a $1.10, which includes $0.03 per share of notable items, which Terry will discuss in more detail in a few moments.","Excluding these notable items, we reported earnings per share of a $1.07 for the quarter. Loan growth accelerated in the fourth quarter driven by strength across our consumer and commercial loan portfolios. The income improvement was supported by growth in new customer accounts and expanding client relationships.","Strong payments revenue growth reflected higher sales volume across the board in retail card, corporate payments, and merchant acquiring. We also saw good business growth in trust and investment management, which offset the impact of unfavorable market conditions.","In summary, loan growth and fee revenue trends remain healthy. As expected, we delivered positive operating leverage on a core basis in both the fourth quarter and for the full year 2018. Credit quality was stable, and our book value increased by 6.3% from a year ago. During the quarter, we returned 80% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.","Slide 4 provides key performance metrics. We delivered a 20.2% return on tangible common equity in the fourth quarter. We also saw year-over-year improvement in our efficiency ratio, return on average assets, and our return on average common equity.","Now, let me turn the call over to Terry who will provide more detail on the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance.","Terrance Dolan","Thanks Andy and good morning. If you turn to Slide 5, I'll start with the balance sheet review and follow up with the discussion of fourth quarter earnings trends. Average loans grew 1.5% on a linked quarter basis and increased 2.6% year-over-year, excluding the impact of the fourth quarter of 2018 sale of the majority of our FDIC covered loans that had reached the end of the loss coverage period.","On the consumer side, we saw continued strength in residential mortgage, credit card, and retail leasing. Credit card loan growth was supported by expansion in both the number of active accounts and sales per active accounts, as well as seasonal sales activity. Digital acquisition of customer accounts across platforms continues to be robust.","As expected, commercial loan growth accelerated and pipelines are strong. Fourth quarter growth was supported by strong M&A financing activity in our corporate banking business line. Paydowns continued to be a headwind to balance growth, however, the pace of the paydowns continues to moderate.","Commercial real estate loans increased on a linked quarter basis, although they declined versus a year ago. Linked quarter growth was partly due to the timing of closings in the third and fourth quarter, which helped average balance comparisons.","Also, during the last several months, the competitive environment has shifted a bit providing more lending opportunities that meet our disciplined underwriting criteria.","Turning to Slide 6, deposits increased 1.3% on a linked quarter basis. As expected, deposits declined on a year-over-year basis reflecting the previously discussed balance migration related to the business merger of a large financial client. This migration impact on deposits continues to moderate.","Slide 7 indicates that credit quality was relatively stable in the fourth quarter. Notably, our non-performing assets declined 1.5% compared with the third quarter and decreased 17.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.","Turning to Slide 8, you'll see highlights of fourth quarter earnings results. We reported earnings per share of $1.10, which included several notable items amounting to $0.03 per share.","Slide 9 lists notable items that affected earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018. Fourth quarter 2018 notable items included a gain from the sale of our ATM servicing business and the sale of majority of the company's covered loans as well as charges related to severance, asset impairments, and accrual for certain legal matters. The company also had a favorable impact to deferred tax assets and liabilities related to changes in estimates from tax reform.","As a reminder, we recognized several notable items during the fourth quarter of 2017, including $825 million of expenses related to settlement of regulatory matters, a special employee bonus, and a contribution to the company's charitable foundation.","Along with the tax impact of revalue and deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the enactment of the tax reform bill, the net impact of notable items in 2017 was $0.09 per common share.","My remarks throughout the remainder of this call will be referencing results excluding notable items incurred in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017.","On Slide 10, linked quarter and year-over-year net interest income growth was supported by higher interest rates and earning assets growth, which was partially offset by higher deposit costs and a shift in funding mix. In the fourth quarter, net interest margin was 3.15%, flat with the third quarter of 2018, but up 4 basis points compared with a year ago.","Slide 11 highlights trends in non-interest income. On a year-over-year basis, we saw strong growth in payments revenue and trust and investment management revenue, partly offset by a decrease in mortgage banking revenue and treasury management fees.","Lower ATM processing servicing fees reflected the sale of the company's ATM servicing business in the fourth quarter of 2018. In 2019, ATM processing servicing revenues will decline by approximately $150 million and the pre-tax income will decline by approximately $70 million as we continue to provide operational services during a transitional conversion period.","Lower mortgage banking revenue reflected the continued, but moderating declines in the industry refinancing activity. Mortgage gain on sale margin was relatively stable in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.","The decline in treasury management fees reflects the impact of changes in earnings credits, which typically -- which is typical in a rising rate environment. The beneficial revenue impact of compensating balances reflected in net interest income more than offset the decline in treasury management revenue.","Turning to our payments business, we had double-digit growth in credit and debit card revenue and corporate payment products revenue, each supported by higher sales volumes.","During the fourth quarter, the federal government completed its renegotiation of certain payment services. While we expanded our market share of future government spend, the business margins will compress in the next few quarters. Additionally, we expect commercial spending volume growth to moderate in 2019.","As such, we expect mid single-digit growth in corporate payments products revenue next year. Strong merchant acquiring sales volume growth drove mid single-digit revenue growth in the fourth quarter in line with our expectations. Trust and investment management fee growth was primarily driven by business growth, offset somewhat by unfavorable market conditions late in the quarter.","Turning to Slide 12, the year-over-year increase in non-interest expense reflected higher compensation expense, primarily due to the impact of hiring to support business growth and compliance programs and a higher variable compensation related to business production. This was partially offset by lower costs related to tax advantage projects and lower FDIC assessment costs.","Slide 13 highlights our capital position. At December 31st, Our common equity tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach was 9.1%. This compares to our target of 8.5%.","I'll now provide some forward looking guidance. For the first quarter, we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to increase in the low single-digits on a year-over-year basis. Net interest income is typically lower in the first quarter of each year due to the impact of day accounts and that will be the case again this year.","Additionally in the first quarter, year-over-year net interest income growth will be negatively impacted by the sale of the acquired loan portfolio yield curve. We expect fee revenue to increase in the low single-digits year-over-year, including the negative impact of the sale of the ATM business. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage on a core basis for the full year of 2019, in line with our previous guidance.","During the fourth quarter of 2018, the provision for income taxes resulted in a taxable equivalent tax rate of 14.6% or 20.1% excluding the notable item from changes in estimates related to deferred tax assets and liabilities.","In the quarter and for the full year of 2019, we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21%. We expect first quarter credit quality to remain relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter.","I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.","Andrew Cecere","Thanks, Terry. As expected, our financial performance gained momentum in the second half of 2018. Long growth accelerated and our key businesses benefited from new strong sales activity and the expansion of existing customer relationships. The economy is strong and resilient and the credit environment continues to be stable.","However, we are mindful and we manage this company for the long-term and we are mindful of the cyclical nature of the banking business. Disciplined credit underwriting is the hallmark of this company and one that has differentiated our credit performance over the entire business cycle. We continue to be very focused on generating high quality credit asset growth.","In the fourth quarter, the OCC terminated its 2015 consent order, following several years of significant investment to improve our Anti-Money Laundering and Bank Secrecy Act programs and controls. The exit will give us more flexibility to optimize our existing branch network and to selectively expand into new markets with a digitally led branch-like strategy.","While technology and innovation investments, such as digital, data analytics and real-time payment capabilities remains a priority for us, we will continue to manage expenses for whatever revenue environment we are operating in.","We expect to deliver positive operating leverage on a core basis in the range of a 100 basis points to a 150 basis points for the full year 2019. In closing, I'm pleased with results we reported this morning, and I'm confident that we will continue to build on the momentum we are seeing across our businesses.","I'd like to thank all our employees for their hard work throughout the year and for their commitment to serving our customers with the expertise and integrity they have come to expect from us.","That concludes our formal remarks. We'll now open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Can I ask you to elaborate a little bit more on your outlook for just the loan side, understanding the -- excluding the covered loan sale at a pretty good clip, how would you just walk us through just what you're seeing out there in the crowd?","You talked about the improving on the commercial side and reasonable pipelines, but just the nature of the loan growth that you're seeing in those pipelines. So do you expected to be able to improve from here or do you expect that this is about again the same type of growth that we've seen for a bit?","Terrance Dolan","Yeah. Ken, this is Terry. So I would say that when we look at the economy, GDP continues to be strong, unemployment is low, consumer confidence continues to be strong and we see that in the consumer spend numbers that we have in our payments business.","On the commercial C&I side, the pipelines at the end of the year continue to be pretty strong. Fourth quarter activity was driven, to some extent, by M&A activities, but we see that continuing into the first quarter. Again, customer spending was generally pretty strong.","The other thing that I would say is that if you end up looking at kind of the mix of business, we saw pretty good growth across all the different categories. The one thing that I would point out is that commercial real estate was actually up this quarter. That was principally due to the timing of some third quarter deals moving into the fourth quarter and some acceleration I think from first to fourth.","If you look at ending loan balances within commercial real estate, in fact we\u2019re down a little bit. And when we think about the first quarter, we expect commercial real estate to be flat to down similar to what it's been in the past. So generally, pretty optimistic with respect to what our outlook of loan growth is. Andy?","Andrew Cecere","I agree. And the only thing I would add to what Terry said is the first quarter is seasonally typically a little lower just in terms of activity, but we've seen strength throughout the year. We were at 0.3, 0.9, 1.5 the last three quarters and I think that's reflective of what we're seeing from a pipeline and from an economic standpoint.","Ken Usdin","Got it. And then just on the flip side, just -- loans have been growing faster than deposits, you still had pretty good underlying deposit growth. Is that a dynamic that we should continue to expect where the loan growth would likely be still ahead of the deposit growth?","Terrance Dolan","Yeah. With respect to deposit growth, just kind of breaking it down a little bit, we saw -- we continue to see good deposit growth with respect to our consumer or retail business.","In fourth quarter, our wholesale deposits were up on a linked quarter basis, which is good. At this particular point in the cycle, if we do see loan growth the way that we saw it in the fourth quarter, it would outpace probably deposit growth a little bit.","Ken Usdin","Okay. All right. Understood. I'll leave it at that.","Andrew Cecere","Thanks Ken.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Andrew Cecere","Hey, John.","John McDonald","Hi, good morning. Good morning.","Andrew Cecere","Good morning, John.","John McDonald","Wanted to talk a little bit about the plans for a positive operating leverage. You're planning for an increase to the 1 to 1.5 range in 2019. And this quarter looks like you came in even above that range or so, 180 basis points or so after adjustment.","So I\u2019m just wondering, how you think about the puts and takes to delivering on that positive operating leverage for this year? What should we keep in mind? And what could push you to the high end of that 1 to 1.5 range?","Terrance Dolan","Yeah. Well, definitely, our focus is on positive operating leverage. The fourth quarter always tends to be stronger because of -- and this year particularly because of tax credit amortization on a year-over-year basis was lower and that is really tied to the enactment of the tax reform bill. The amount of deliverables of deal closings with respect to tax credits just needed to be less and that favorably impacted this year and the fourth quarter.","As we certainly think about going into next year, I think there's just a number of different things that are moving in the right direction, and all the mortgage related costs continue to come down. I think that we -- if you remember in November, we had kind of a reorganization redesign, where we looked at management spans and layers and just a number of levers like that that we are using to kind of set us up for our success next year. Andy?","Andrew Cecere","You know what I'd add, John, is we're going to continue to invest in all the initiatives we talked about the digital, the payments, the data analytics and so forth, so that'll be a continued investment.","At the same time, I think exiting the consent order gives us more flexibility in our physical asset optimization, so I think you're going to see us being more proactive in terms of optimizing our branch network, which will offer us expense opportunities. So those are the big -- two big puts and takes from the perspective of a high level.","John McDonald","Okay. And just I guess as broad comparison, how should we think about expense growth in '19 relative to what we saw in 2018, particularly with the FDIC surcharge rolling off as a bit of a tailwind?","Terrance Dolan","Yeah. I think that it's probably going to be in line with the expense growth that we saw kind of on a full year basis with probably a small amount of improvement from there.","John McDonald","Okay. Just expenses in 2019 versus '18...","Terrance Dolan","Yeah. On a quarter-on-quarter basis.","John McDonald","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Terrance Dolan","Thanks, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Erika Najarian","Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask a little bit more about the funding mix dynamics. I think the market is starting to assume that the fed will be on a long pause after this December rate hike.","And I'm wondering, how we should think about whether or not the mix shift will continue? And how many quarters until after the fed stops raising rates? Do you typically see a drop off in deposit repricing?","Terrance Dolan","Yeah. So I guess, if you're looking at rate hikes under the yield curve kind of where it is, I would expect that the real driver with respect to deposit mix and pricing as also where that is going to be both competition in the market and that competition is going to be based upon what sort of loan growth we see.","So I think you end up having to kind of look at both sides of the balance sheet to kind of figure out what sort of dynamics you're going to have with respect to deposit flows. Once the fed stops moving rates, I think you start to see stabilization with respect to deposit betas, for the most part with the exception of the penny pressure you have from a competitive standpoint to fund loans.","And then kind of coming back to your question, if rates start to move down, we typically move deposit rates fairly quickly because the betas associated with things like corporate trust and wholesale are -- tend to be higher.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And just to confirm, a very strong message on the positive operating leverage for full year 2019. If the revenue environment is a little bit short of expectation, we should still expect a 100 basis points to 150 basis points of operating leverage is how we should think about it?","Terrance Dolan","Yes, Erika. We're going to manage the company reflective and incorporating the revenue environment, so yes.","Erika Najarian","Got it. That's clear. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore. Your line is open.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Andrew Cecere","Hey, John.","Terrance Dolan","Good morning John.","John Pancari","You mentioned in your commentary around loan growth that you're seeing -- you saw some shift in the competitive environment and became a bit more accommodative to produce. Is that mainly on the real estate side, on the commercial real estate side, where you saw that or are you seeing that a little bit on the broader commercial?","Andrew Cecere","Yeah. No, I would say that we saw that on the commercial real estate side. Earlier in the year, there was a lot of competition on what I would say a lot of structures that we just wouldn't do. and I think as we are getting later in the cycle and the yield curve has shifted down, the competition has pulled back from commercial real estate and so the structures that we have seen most recently are things that we feel pretty comfortable about and that's why there was a little bit of a shift.","I would say though that when you end up looking at areas like auto lending, mortgage lending, price competition continues to be very, very strong. In fact, we -- in auto lending, you'll notice that growth has slowed there a little bit and that's because we haven't chased yields down. We've been willing to give up some volume in order to maintain profitability. So it's just probably more so on the commercial real estate side than anywhere else.","John Pancari","Got it. Okay. All right. And then on the corporate payments side, I know you indicated mid single-digit growth for the full year '19. How has that changed from your previous expectations? How has that been trajecting? And then also, how would you view that growth versus what you expect for the broader industry? Are you still in a position of regaining market share there and should it exceed the industry levels? Thanks.","Terrance Dolan","Yeah. So a couple of different things. I think government spend will change a little bit. In terms of the renegotiation of the contract, we actually captured more market shares on a long term basis. We feel good that our spend is going to grow. But because of the margin compression really over the next several quarters, it will take a while to kind of lap that. That's a big driver.","And then the commercial spend in the -- on the business side has been particularly strong this year, certainly double-digits, I want to say close the 12% in the fourth quarter. We would expect to see that kind of moderate in 2019, so there's a couple of different factors that are really driving that as we think about commercial product revenue.","Andrew Cecere","But it is a function of more of a moderation of the corporate spend as well as the renegotiation. In both cases, we expect continued market share growth, so it's not a market share issue at all, it's a -- in the corporate side, it's more of an environment issue, on the government side it's more the renegotiation and really taking market share. Yeah.","John Pancari","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Betsy Graseck","Hey. Thanks so much. Good morning.","Andrew Cecere","Hey, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Andy, I wanted to just understand a little bit more about your comments around optimizing the brand strategy. Maybe if you could give us some color on what your thoughts and plans are there? And when you mentioned selectively expand, is this organic? And -- or not? Or is it inorganic? And give us some color on what hits your bar.","Andrew Cecere","Right. Betsy, one of the most impactful components of the consent order was our inability to open new branches, which also put a little bit in terms of constraints on us in terms of closing branches because we couldn't optimize the structure and the footprint.","So if you think about the last few years, we've been closing in the neighborhood of 1% to 2% of our branches. I would expect that to accelerate to really optimize the footprint, think about where we have branches close to each other, given the transaction exodus that's occurring in the branches.","While at the same time, looking at selective markets, where we are not in, so that could be either in our footprint in better locations and\/or some out of footprint where we have a large customer base, which we would go in with a very digitally focused branch-like strategy.","So it just allows us a lot more flexibility and I think that 1% to 2% will -- net closures will become a higher number, which would allow more savings on a go forward basis.","Betsy Graseck","And the digital focus and it's a little -- it's either adjacent or a little bit separated geographies to get the deposit growth that you're looking for from those markets, is this going to be a rate led as well? Will you be leaning into higher yielding products or is it going to be in line with the kind of pricing that you have in your branched areas?","Andrew Cecere","I would expect it to be in line. And as we talked about in previous calls, Betsy, the focus would be to leverage current customers who already have either a home mortgage, an auto loan, a credit card that's US bank in their wallet, but don't have a full banking relationship and trying to leverage those relationships in a more full expansion standpoint with the current similar deposit rates that we're currently offering.","Terrance Dolan","These are customers that know us and like us with respect to those particular products, we're just trying to deepen that relationship on the deposit side using digital capability.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, that's clear. Now, that's super thank you. And then just a ticky-tacky on the ATM, you went through in 2019, the revs and operating income that you'll have in 2019. In 2020 as we think out to that timeframe, does it -- do those revenues and expenses come out in 2020 or is this something that's going to continue for a while?","Andrew Cecere","Yeah. There is roughly a two-year transition period and -- but I do expect in 2020 that those expenses will start to come down. And the reason for that is as you go through the conversion process, you will slowly ramp down that business and the transition period is intended to cover that entire time frame.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And the expenses and revenues come down ratably, I assume?","Terrance Dolan","Yeah. The expenses come down ratably, yeah.","Betsy Graseck","Yeah. Okay, got it. All right. Thank you.","Terrance Dolan","Thanks, Betsy.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Kevin Barker","Good morning.","Andrew Cecere","Hey, Kevin.","Terrance Dolan","Hey, Kevin.","Kevin Barker","Hey. You guys mentioned that some of the business spending may impact your payments or maybe slow the growth there just a bit, but you've kept overall guidance for fee income in mid single-digits, I believe. Could you just talk about the puts and takes for fee income going into 2019, absent some of the things that we're seeing in mortgage banking that you've said could be a little bit better or just on a comp basis year-over-year?","Terrance Dolan","Yeah. Well, again, going within payments, we continue to expect that credit cards is going to do well. We could look into 2019, again sales volumes have been particularly strong and we continue to believe, based upon the consumer spending, consumer confidence that that will hold up.","Merchant acquiring is an area that we would continue to expect to accelerate some in 2019. We made some nice investments in integrated software solutions and in kind of the e-commerce sort of areas over the course of the last 18 months and more and more revenue from that kind of starts to come online.","So I think within payments, I think that is an area. I think the other thing is that in broad brushes, mortgage banking revenue, which has been a big drag, a big headwind with respect to fee income we really believe in 2019 starts to moderate. For a couple of different reasons is that the vast majority of our business is purchase money as opposed to refinance at this particular point in time.","The other thing is that about two years ago, two and a half years ago, we started to shift more toward retail channels as opposed to correspondent mortgage production and margins there had been holding up and we would expect them to be stable or expand.","Home sales currently are projected to be positive, so it may not be exactly in the first quarter, but certainly when we look at the second half year, we think that becomes at least neutral, if not a little bit positive. So those would be kind of big takes.","Kevin Barker","Okay. And then could you just provide a little bit more detail on the impact of integrated software on your merchant acquiring business and what your outlook is for the growth year-over-year with the merchant acquiring?","Andrew Cecere","Sure. This is Andy. As we talked about, there's a few focus areas, the merchant acquiring, one of them is the integrated software providers, another is the e-commerce as well as omni channel and those are areas we continue to both invest in as well as acquire.","You saw that we did a couple of transactions in the last 90 days, both focused in those areas. So that is an area of continued focus and one of the reasons we expect our merchant acquiring business to grow in the mid single-digits.","Kevin Barker","Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.","Andrew Cecere","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby from Vining Sparks. Your line is open.","Andrew Cecere","Hey, Marty.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. Hey. I had two questions. One was on merchant processing. The other fees in the processing business are growing double-digits. We're still not seeing merchant processing kind of kicking in.","So I just wanted from the business standpoint, I know that there has been some dynamics in that competitive environment, where five years ago, it was very favorable. And then now, the big players kind of back in the toes. So just your thoughts about the competitive environment and what you're seeing in merchant processing.","Terrance Dolan","Yeah. From a merchant processing standpoint, again, I think that from a competitive standpoint, there had been a shift over the years really from what I would call financial institution portfolio type of business to really more tech led sort of business growth, relying more on digital and integrated software providers, being focused on industry segments and those sorts of things.","And we -- as part of our investment, we've been making that shift as well. And so that's why when we think about next year, we continue to see and expect same-store sales, but also a new business accelerate and grow. And I think that's going to be a big driver, but that's been kind of competitive shift that's been taking place.","I think that the positive thing as we shift more to that tech led is that it has higher growth rates and better margins than the kind of the traditional business. As we talked about, Marty, in the past, this is really a business that has moved away from just transaction processing to being able to really provide to merchants information. And that's why that tech led sort of investment and spend and initiative is critically important.","Marty Mosby","The other thing is you have a higher percentage of your portfolio that's held to maturity, but you still have some left and available for sale. As interest rates are still at a higher level than what the portfolio rates that you have are actually on the balance sheet, are you thinking about any deployment of capital into restructuring to take advantage and lock some of those rates in because it is a fragile opportunity like we saw here in the last quarter when rates can kind of reverse on this pretty quickly?","Terrance Dolan","Yeah. I think your question, if I understand it and you kind of focus on that one area, but just what would we think about in terms of duration of assets and shifting maybe our focus from our asset growth perspective and it is kind of when the yield curve flattens, certainly strategies you end up looking at is emphasizing a little longer duration fixed rate sort of assets.","So whether that's mortgage or auto or whatever might be the case. And then in the investment portfolio, as we see maturities and as we have the opportunity to invest cash, our expectation is we probably will go a little bit longer in terms of the duration of new purchases. So we are thinking about that.","Marty Mosby","And any willingness to take some losses and restructure what's unavailable for sale to round up to the current rates?","Terrance Dolan","We don't have any plans at this particular point in time to do that.","Marty Mosby","Thanks.","Terrance Dolan","Yeah.","Andrew Cecere","Thanks, Marty.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez from UBS. Your line is open.","Saul Martinez","Hey. Good morning, everybody.","Andrew Cecere","Hey, Saul.","Saul Martinez","Hey. A couple of questions, First, now with a consent order sort of in the rearview mirror, can you just give us what your updated thoughts are on your M&A strategy in organic growth opportunities? Just what are some of the parameters around which you might gauge any opportunities or if that's not part of the thought process, also that would you just let us know if there's any update on your M&A? How you're thinking about M&A right now?","Andrew Cecere","So Saul. This is Andy. Actually the consent order doesn't really change our M&A strategy. I think the types of transactions you've seen us do in the last few quarters and as well as the last few years, we've been consistent with what we've focused on going forward, which are smaller payments, services deals, building capabilities around technology, the integrated software vendors that we talked about and so forth, so that isn't going to change.","As I talked about, I think the opportunity that the exit of the consent order provides is physical asset optimization really optimizing our branch structure and that's both optimizing from the perspective of reducing space and\/or the footprint as well as investing in certain locations to take advantage of where the market is going. So I think that's where you'll see us being a little bit more active.","Saul Martinez","Okay. So there's really no thought -- no updated thought in terms of specifically how you might think about a deposit for you?","Andrew Cecere","And throughout the consent process, we -- as we've talked about, there really hasn't been a transaction that's come across our desk when we look at all things, that we would have wanted to do. As we've talked about in this new environment, which is one where transactions are migrating away from the branch, we have more digital capabilities.","The whole math around depository is very different, so I would expect our focus to be, as I said, on payments, transactions, software -- integrated software providers and optimizing the branch pressure.","Terrance Dolan","And so the thing that I would add and things that we talked about. If you think about doing a, let's say a more significant depository sort of transaction, we have so many things that we think are critically important with respect to digital capabilities and kind of that whole transformation over the course of the next few years that if you did a fairly sizable transaction, there's a fair amount of management disruption that takes place as a result of that and -- but honestly we just don't think that should be our priority right now.","Saul Martinez","Okay. Now, that's very clear. And the outlook for credit quality, and forgive me if you addressed this, I jumped on a little bit late, but what are your update -- did you give any expectations for what you think -- how you think NCOs or loan loss provisions may track or ALLL levels? And if not, just any color on how you're thinking about the credit quality outlook here?","Terrance Dolan","So as we've said on the past, when you think about our particular portfolios on the commercial side, typically high investment grade on the consumer side, prime, super prime type of portfolios, our net charge off stay at 1 roughly around 50 basis points, little shy of that.","And our outlook when we think about 2019 is credit quality continuing to be very stable and we don't see a significant change with respect to either the rate of net charge offs. From a provision standpoint, the provision will really track loan growth more than anything.","Andrew Cecere","This quarter's increase to reserve and the $50 million is really a function of loan growth number just [indiscernible].","Saul Martinez","Got it. So we should expect ALLL level more or less to stay where they are at?","Terrance Dolan","Yeah. Yeah, I would agree. And the other thing, early delinquencies and all those sort of statistics, we're just not seeing any real significant movement or change in that. So pretty stable.","Saul Martinez","Okay, got it. Thanks so much.","Terrance Dolan","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Your line is open.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning, guys.","Terrance Dolan","Good morning, Gerard.","Andrew Cecere","Hey, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Andy, when you look out over the next 12 months, and if you agree that we are not likely to go into a recession in the United States and if you just take the geopolitical kind of episodic risk out there, what are the risks that you guys kind of talk about for the business over the next 12 months?","Andrew Cecere","Well, you take out probably the principal risk that we talked about, the geopolitical risk. That is impactful. The outcome on tariffs impacts certain of our companies, I think that is a function of what decisions will be made, the confidence in those decisions deferring certain investments.","Those are all encompassed in geopolitical and tariff component. I think the other factor for us and for many banks is what's happening with rates and the yield curve that's something at a high level that we're very focused on and some of the questions that came up in this call in terms of the balance sheet position and so forth.","And then finally, the investments that we're making, the business the banking environment is changing very rapidly. And as we think about what we're doing with our payments businesses, with our branch footprint, with our structure, with our -- the ways we connect with our customers and the way we use data for the benefit of the customer, those are all the things we are focused on.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then maybe Terry, can you give us an update and I apologize if you've addressed this already, on just your views of Cecil and what you're expecting? And I assume you're expecting it will go live in the first quarter of 2020?","Terrance Dolan","Yeah. I mean, purely from a timing standpoint, I think the entire industry has been in the process of developing and building models over the last couple of years. And we're in pretty good shape with respect to that. 2019 from our standpoint is kind of the final dimensioning of that as well as kind of running parallel with respect to our existing models to make sure that at -- will we go live on January 1, 2020, we're in good shape.","If you end up thinking about, Cecil ends up getting impacted by where you're at in the business cycle at the time that you end up adopting this. And as you know, it'll create a little bit more volatility. But based upon current conditions, I think, some of the other estimates that are out there, 20% to 30% sort of impact is kind of a reasonable estimate on day one.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. And do you -- just to follow up on that, do you guys expect to kind of come out with something in the middle of this year or you're going to wait until the end of the year to get a full 12 months of the parallel systems and then obviously be very strong on the number that you know it's going to be?","Terrance Dolan","Yeah. I think we'll probably -- I mean, our expectation right now is that midyear will start to be able to provide some ranges, but again the cautionary factor there is that that will be a point in time. And if conditions change between then and the end of the year, we would end up having to adjust.","Gerard Cassidy","Sure. I appreciate it. Okay. Thank you.","Terrance Dolan","Yeah, thanks.","Operator","And we have no further questions in queue at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.","Jenn Thompson","Thanks for listening to our call.

Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","This call will be recorded and available for replay, beginning today at approximately noon, Eastern Standard Time, through Wednesday April 24 at 12:00 midnight, Eastern Standard Time.","I\u2019ll now turn the conference call over to Jenn Thompson, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.","Jenn Thompson","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning to everyone who\u2019s joined our call. Andy Cecere and Terry Dolan are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s first quarter results and to answer your questions. Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.","I\u2019d like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today\u2019s presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Andy.","Andy Cecere","Thanks, Jenn, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry and I will be taking your questions.","I\u2019ll begin on Slide 3. In the first quarter, we reported earnings of $1 per share. The slide highlights a number of financial metrics, but at a high level, growth in net interest income and fee revenues were in line with our expectations, credit quality was stable, and we delivered positive operating leverage. Our balance sheet is strong and growing and we continue to see good account and volume momentum across our fee businesses, which is driving market share gains.","Turning to capital management; our book value increased by 8.6% from a year ago. During the quarter, we returned 77% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Slide 4 provides key performance metrics. In the first quarter, we delivered an 18.4% return on tangible common equity, and a 1.49% return on average assets.","Now let me turn the call over to Terry, who\u2019ll provide more detail on the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance.","Terry Dolan","Thanks, Andy. If you turn to Slide 5, I\u2019ll start with the balance sheet review and follow up with the discussion of our first quarter earnings trends. Average loans grew 0.9% on a linked-quarter basis and increased 3.7% year-over-year, excluding the impact of the second quarter 2018 sale of our federally guaranteed student loan portfolio and the fourth quarter 2019 sale of FDIC covered loans that had reached the end of the loss coverage period.","On the consumer side, we saw good growth in our residential mortgage, retail leasing and installment loan portfolio. Digital acquisition of customer accounts across platforms continues to be robust.","Commercial loan growth accelerated in the first quarter, driven by M&A-related lending, slower pay down activity, partly due to timing. New business pipelines are healthy, although, pay down activity is likely to remain elevated and chop in near term. As expected, commercial real estate loans decreased on a sequential and year-over-year basis. This quarter, commercial real estate contributed a 40 basis point drag to linked-quarter average loan growth and an 80 basis point drag to year-over-year average loan growth.","Given what we consider to be a still unfavorable risk reward dynamic in certain areas of commercial real estate lending, we expect pay down pressure, which has moderated from peak levels, but continue \u2013 but will continue to restrict growth in this portfolio.","Turning to Slide 6, deposits increased 0.3% on a linked-quarter basis and 0.2% year-over-year. As previously discussed, balance migration related to the business merger of a large financial client continues to impact deposit growth on a year-over-year basis. This migration impact on deposits will continue to moderate through mid-year.","Slide 7 indicates that credit quality was relatively stable in the first quarter. Nonperforming assets increased modestly versus the fourth quarter, but were lower by 16.5% compared to the first quarter of 2018. Slide 8 highlights first quarter earnings. We generated earnings by $1 per share in the first quarter of 2019 compared to earnings per share of $0.96 a year ago.","Turning to Slide 9, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was lower by 1.4% compared to the fourth quarter, but increased 2.8% year-over-year, which was in line with our expectations. Both linked-quarter and year-over-year comparisons benefited from loan growth and interest rate hikes. As is typical in the first quarter, linked-quarter growth was negatively impacted by two fewer days. The first quarter of 2019 also experienced lower interest recoveries than the fourth quarter of 2018.","Slide 10 highlights trends in noninterest income. On a year-over-year basis, we saw mid-single-digit growth in both merchant processing revenue and corporate payments products revenue, each driven by higher sales volumes. Credit card and debit card revenue declined by 6.2% from a year ago despite strong average account growth this quarter. There were fewer processing days in the first quarter of 2019 than in the first quarter of 2018, which created an approximate 500 basis point headwind to year-over-year revenue growth.","Also a favorable change in accounting for prepaid revenue in the first quarter of 2018 negatively impacted the credit and debit card revenue growth rate by approximately 400 basis points on a year-over-year basis. The billing cycle impact is simply a timing issue within the full year of 2019 credit and debit card revenue. Both of these items are idiosyncratic our business.","In the fourth quarter of 2018, we sold our third-party ATM servicing business. However, we continue to provide operational services during a transitional conversion period. Given the sale, we have combined ATM processing revenue with debit \u2013 deposit service charges for recording purposes. The transition services revenue associated with ATM business is included in other income.","As a result, for the decline and deposit service charges in the first quarter was driven by the impact of the sale of our ATM business. The increase in other income was driven by the inclusion of the transition services revenue, which will decrease over time as well as higher tax credits indications and equity investment revenue.","Lower mortgage banking revenue in the first quarter was primarily driven by relative changes in MSR valuations. However, mortgage origination revenue grew in the first quarter and application volume was up 10% from a year ago. We continue to expect growth in mortgage banking revenue for the full year of 2019.","Decline in treasury management fees continues to reflect the impact of changes in earnings credits, which is typical in a rising rate environment. The beneficial revenue and impact of compensating balances, which is reflected in net interest income, more than offset the decline in treasury management revenue.","Turning to Slide 11, the year-over-year increase in noninterest expense reflected higher compensation expense, primarily due to the higher \u2013 impact of hirings to support business growth. This was partially offset by a decrease in other expense, primarily reflecting lower costs related to tax advantage projects and lower FDIC assessment costs.","Slide 12 highlights our capital position. At March 31, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel 3 Standardized approach was 9.3%. This compares to our target of 8.5%.","I\u2019ll now provide some forward-looking guidance. For the second quarter, we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to increase in the low single digits on a year-over-year basis. We expect fee revenue to increase in the low single digits year-over-year, including the negative impact of the sale of the ATM business.","We expect to deliver positive operating leverage of 100 to 150 basis points for the full year of 2019, in line with our previous guidance. We continue to expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 20% on a full year basis. Credit quality in the second quarter is expected to remain relatively stable compared with the first quarter. Loan loss provision expense growth will continue to be reflective of loan growth.","I\u2019ll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.","Andy Cecere","Thanks, Terry. The start of the year is saving enough of cash we expected. The U.S. economy is healthy and supportive of growth and a credit quality environment is stable. Macro environment aside, we are confident in our ability to execute and win market share across our lending and fee businesses, supported by our scale, our skill and our risk management discipline.","Success in the banking industry will increasingly depend on our ability and determination to adapt to the evolving demands of our customers. The investments we\u2019re making in technology and innovation will play a critical role in our long-term success. And the payoff will be increasingly visible in the form of customer acquisition or retention as well as operational efficiency.","One area we\u2019ve been placing a lot of attention is our digital capabilities. We recently launched our newly developed mobile app, which incorporates improves sales functionality and enables a more seamless experience for our customers. Early, feedback from users has been very positive.","If you turn to Slide 13, I want to share a few digital metrics we track. You can see from these slides that digital engagement with our customers is growing and an increasing percentage of transactions and lending activities are occurring outside of our physical locations. Particularly encouraging is the trend in digital loan sales. Approximately one-third of all loan sales are now completed digitally up from 25% a year ago.","Mortgage lending and small business lending are early digital lending success stories. Currently, nearly 75% of all mortgage loans are completed digitally end-to-end, and that percentage is growing. This past September, we lost the fully digital lending solution for small businesses that can significantly reduce the customers\u2019 time to credit decision and funding to in some cases, as short as one hour.","Migration of sales and transactions to our digital platform will enhance customer experience, improve operational efficiency and enable expansion into existing markets, where we currently have customers, but little or no physical footprint. In closing, we\u2019re off to a good start to the year and momentum is building across our businesses. I\u2019d like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication throughout the year.","That concludes our formal remarks. We\u2019ll now open up the call to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","John McDonald","Thank you. Andy and Terry, hi, good morning. I wanted to ask you guys about the operating leverage target for this year. You came in at the low end of the range, the 1 to 1.5 this quarter, but that included some pressure from the billing cycle processing days issue. So as you look ahead, do you have a bias towards the lower or the higher end of that 1 to 1.50 range? Or I guess, may be said differently, what kind of environment would get you at the lower end of the operating leverage target and what would it need to do to get to the higher end?","Terry Dolan","Yes, John. This is Terry. And I think that where we end up in the range will partly driven by what sort of revenue growth we see throughout the year. The extent that revenue growth picks up a little bit gives us the opportunity to be close to the higher end, but if it\u2019s a challenging revenue environment, we\u2019re more likely to be closer to that lower end of the range, I think we\u2019re just going to continue to manage to and make decisions based upon both short-term and long-term sort of objectives of the company.","John McDonald","Okay. And what\u2019s the right level of expense growth for USB in this kind of environment? You have got a little less pressure from compliance spend and some relief there, but on the other hand, you\u2019re stepping up investments and you\u2019re getting a little help from FDIC\u2019s surcharge roll off. How should we think about our expenses? And what you think about this year? And what\u2019s kind of a good target for you guys?","Andy Cecere","Hi, John. This is Andy. Yes, you\u2019re right about both of these items. The pressure on compliance cost is eased as well as we\u2019re getting some benefit from FDIC. We will continue to make technology investments for all the digital capabilities that I referred to in my comments. I think another important factor is what the lifting of the consent order. We have a lot more flexibility and physical asset optimization.","So I think the other lever that you\u2019re going to see us utilized is branch optimization, which over the next couple of years, I would expect 10% to 15% reduction in our actual physical account of branches. We\u2019re going to open up some in places, we\u2019re going to be remodeling and changing the footprint, but the net of it will be down 10% to 15%.","John McDonald","Okay. And then just one follow-up on the operating leverage. Is there any cadence or seasonality to kind of the operating leverage and did that billing issue with the processing days hurt you in the first quarter and keep you at the lower end? Thanks.","Terry Dolan","Yes. So from a seasonality standpoint, certainly the impact of the credit card revenue growth did end up impacting it. But as probably narrows just a little bit midyear and then tends to expand in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s fairly consistent through the year.","Andy Cecere","That\u2019s right, Terry. Typically over the past many years, I think our strongest and weakest quarters just in terms of principally driven by revenue seasonality, a lot of it\u2019s the payment businesses, but a lot of businesses, three, four, two, one strongest to weakest.","John McDonald","Okay. But in terms of year-over-year operating leverage that doesn\u2019t necessarily apply, that\u2019ll depend on the environment more so whether you get up to that 1.5?","Terry Dolan","Yes, on the revenue environment, right.","Andy Cecere","Yes, where the revenue grows because some of it\u2019s variable expense.","John McDonald","Okay. Thank you.","Andy Cecere","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Andy Cecere","Hi, John.","Terry Dolan","Hey, John.","John Pancari","On the margin side, first on the \u2013 actually more specifically around deposits, we saw pretty good decline in the non-interest-bearing in the quarter. Can you give us a little bit more color around the driver of that and if you expect a continued shift at that pace into interest-bearing? I want to get your thoughts on that first.","Terry Dolan","Yes. So there\u2019s certainly continues to be some migration to interest-bearing sort of deposits by our customers. We\u2019re seeing it mostly on the wholesale side as well as a little bit on the trust side. And that\u2019s a function of them looking for higher yield. It\u2019s also a function as earnings credit rates have come up with rising rates just more excess deposits that they have the opportunity to be able to shift. I do think that that moderates a bit simply because with short-term rates kind of on hold, there\u2019s going to be a lot of less pressure on earnings credit rates and then that is going to not reduced, but at least lower the increase of the any excess deposits. So, I do expect it to moderate a bit.","John Pancari","Okay. So how would that play into your margin outlook here, as you saw about a bit of expansion in this quarter. Is it fair to assume relatively stable despite that continue to flow into interest bearing but with the expected abatement? Thanks.","Terry Dolan","Yes. So as saw, our net interest margin was up a one basis point on a linked-quarter basis. Given the current rate environment, my expectations from a deposit standpoint is that deposit base will compare, the pricing will continue to creep up a little bit. It will be more driven by the loan growth than, where that loan growth is occurring. Our expectation is really no rate hikes for the rest of the year, that the yield curve stays relatively flat. And given that environment, our outlook for the rest of the year is a fairly flat net interest margin.","And then the other thing I would just point out is that there is a little bit of seasonality for us because of our credit card portfolio. In the second quarter, it\u2019s usually flat to down a little bit one basis point or two. So just kind of expect that in the second quarter, but for the full year and through the rest of the year, we pretty much expect it to be flat.","John Pancari","Got it. All right. Thanks, Terry.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Erika Najarian","Hi, Good morning.","Terry Dolan","Good morning, Erica.","Erika Najarian","I just wanted to follow-up on John\u2019s question on positive operating leverage. Just wanted to be clear because I think there\u2019s a little bit of confusion how the market interpreted your comments on the previous call. So in the environment we\u2019re both NII and fees are going low single-digits, can we assume that expenses will be flat to up 1% if that\u2019s the revenue environment that we are in? I\u2019m just trying to make sure we\u2019re interpreting it correctly.","Terry Dolan","Yes. Erika, we clearly don\u2019t understand the revenue environment that we\u2019re in right now. And we\u2019re looking at every opportunity to be able to manage our expenses down. So I think your expectation is right that we\u2019re going to be very prudent with respect to our spending. We look at -- from a leverage standpoint, Andy talked a total bit about physical optimization you\u2019re looking at any discretionary spending.","You remember from the fourth quarter, we went through kind of an organizational redesign that will have some benefits to us throughout this year and also in the first quarter with the Tim Welsh taking over our consumer banking business. That gives us the opportunity to kind of look at the organizational design structure. So it\u2019s little whole variety of different things. And then if you remember FDIC surcharge going the way giving us some flexibility in order to be able to get there. So, I think there are number of different levers, but it is challenging, but we\u2019re going to end up having to manage in that environment and that\u2019s our expectation.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Perfect. And underneath your outlook for flat net interest margin, you\u2019ve often talked to us about the concept of terminal betas especially on the commercial side. In the environment of no Fed rate hikes, what kind of flexibility do you have on your pricing? And if you could, because we\u2019ve done so well in the past, give us a sense of how you think pricing will trend on the commercial side versus the retail side?","Terry Dolan","Yes. I think that given the right environment without rate hikes, again, I think, the deposit pricing and how that changes will be a function of what sort of loan growth you see and the need to -- and the competition you have with respect to deposits in that situation. I do expect that on the wholesale trust side, there is still going to be -- continue to be some pressure, but I do believe that, that alleviates itself quite a bit. The other thing is that, if you end of \u2013 looking at our deposit growth, we\u2019re seeing the deposit growth in terms of consumer balances, and as you know, the pricing flexibility on that site is a little bit better.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open.","Scott Siefers","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question.","Terry Dolan","Moring, Scott.","Scott Siefers","Terry. I was just wondering if you could spend just a second digging into your loan growth outlook. I guess, my understanding was sort of the 1Q would be sort of seasonally weaker and then maybe things accelerate a bit from there. But in your prepared remarks, you\u2019ve mentioned, the pay down pressure and particularly on the CRE side a couple of times. So just curious for any updated thoughts you might have on the overall loan growth trajectory?","Terry Dolan","Yes. So when we end up looking at the loan growth. I think, it\u2019s hard to look also too far. Certainly when we think about the second quarter, our expectations is that loans will grow kind of in line with a linked-quarter growth that we saw in the first quarter. But may be let me give a little bit of context in terms of some of the dynamics. The middle market loan growth was stronger in the first quarter, on a linked-quarter basis, it was up about a 1.3%, and year-over-year, its closer to about 5%. So we saw a nice growth in the middle market space. We saw a good growth with respect to our auto lending. It was a little bit less price competitive during the first quarter, and we kind of expect that to continue.","Residential mortgages are -- our mortgage volume was a strong in the first quarter and so we continue to believe that\u2019s going to be a positive thing. C&I, in general, was good. I mean, I think the economy is solid, our C&I pipelines are strong at this particular point in time and businesses continue to spend and makes some business investment. And so I think there is a lot of different factors that would suggest that sort of growth will continue. I think there\u2019re two things in terms of overall total loans that created a bit of a drag. We talked little bit about our Commercial Real Estate portfolio, and our expectation is that will continue to slowly -- to continue to be a bit of a drag throughout the rest of the year just based upon where we\u2019re at in the business cycle.","And then within C&I kind of buried there is tax exempt loans. And when the tax rates change for a corporates coming down, but individuals staying pretty high, the appetite I guess what where the opportunity build to grow tax exempt in the corporate size equation or a banking size equation is a little bit more challenging. So that on a linked-quarter basis in the first quarter was about 20 basis points drag for us. So it is kind of a number of puts and takes, but overall, we feel good about where the economy is and where our businesses are spending.","Scott Siefers","Okay. Perfect, that\u2019s a good color. I appreciate that. And then if I could, one more \u2013 take that one, just maybe your other fee income, I think there was kind of not too long ago where you were doing about $250 million a quarter. That be definitely a big outsized quarter, but more recently, it\u2019s kind of crapped up there kind of steadily, consistently been in sort of a $225 million to $250 million range. If you look at $247 million this quarter, is that a pretty good base to go off of or was there anything volatile or unusual in there?","Terry Dolan","Yes. That\u2019s a little bit of lumpy in terms of other revenue. Probably the guidance that I would end up giving you is that, through the rest of the year, we would expect the range to be somewhere between $175 million to $225 million on the quarterly basis. So if you\u2019re modeling kind of in between there, I think that\u2019s a good estimate.","Scott Siefers","All right. That\u2019s perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Andy, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve spoken since the up mergers of equals transactions we got last quarter. And I think we all know where you have stood as far as the current strategic imperatives of work on the digital strategy consolidate some of the branches. Just wondering as where you stand on your view of our U.S. banks size and scale? And how you think if any differently just about either the need or desire to think about Bank M&A down the road even, if not today, but just from a bigger picture strategic point?","Andy Cecere","Sure, Ken. First, let me say we consider all options for growth and we look at anything that is available and\/or any strategic initiative that would be sensible for our company. But I will tell you, I think our near-term focus will likely be on the fee businesses, the working processing to trust businesses that we\u2019re focusing on. We have a lot of momentum across our digital activities, you have a lot more flexibility and now that we\u2019re out of the consent order, we\u2019re making a lot of progress across all of our business plans, and I feel very comfortable with where we are today.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And then two just small ones. First, on the card spending rate of growth slowing, I know part was a billing cycle, but just can you just talk to us about what of it is just the underlying in terms of any changes you\u2019re just seeing or feeling in terms of just the consumer? That was the first one. The second one was just, commercial loans are up a lot sequentially about 30 basis points, I\u2019m just wondering what was underneath that increase? Thanks guys.","Terry Dolan","Yes. So maybe on the consumer spend, again we talked about the fewer processing days necessarily was an impact. But one of the thing that we saw kind of post holiday is that consumer spend did drop pretty dramatically, came back in January, a little stronger in February and it is kind of that 4% year-over-year growth rate in March. Our expectation on a full year basis is that, that will continue to get stronger kind of in that 5% to 6% sort of range in terms of continuing to accelerate from a sales standpoint.","From a revenue perspective, I think that, again, it\u2019s going to continue to get stronger in the second and third quarter. We\u2019ll recapture some of those processing days. But our expectation for our credit and debit card revenue for the full year, given the impact of the first quarter, is really low single-digits at this particular point in time.","Andy Cecere","And, Terry, that first quarter, it was the period government shut down, there was some turbulence in equity market, there was weather impacts across our geographies sales, those things and all passed us right now, that\u2019s why we look more confident and what more.","Terry Dolan","Yes, it is hard to identified any single or anyone of those things. But I think every one of them had some impact in the early part of the first quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning.","Terry Dolan","Hi, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Recently, you\u2019ve announced the hiring of a new Chief Digital Officer, Derek White, and I just wanted to understand what your expectation is for how Derek is going to be impacting our U.S. Bancorp? He\u2019s a pretty senior higher, I know you did a whole revamp of our mobile platform, so I\u2019m wondering what\u2019s left?","Andy Cecere","There is a lot left. So we have a lot of activity going on from the digital perspective. We have a 20 agile studios in growing. We have just developed a new app and we\u2019re to continue to enhance and we continue to improve that. We have real-time payments that\u2019s impacting the consumer side of the equation as well as the wholesale, and ultimately, payments. We have AI going on. We have block chain. We have initiatives across all the business lines focused on digital activities and Derek\u2019s goal will be to really bring that altogether into a common U.S. bank sort of vision and theme, so that we\u2019re really optimizing with their customers across all business lines and really leveraging capabilities across our all of our business lines for the benefit of the customer. So we\u2019re excited to have Derek on board. He has great capabilities, a great background, and I think he\u2019s going to fit in the team perfectly.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. So it\u2019s beyond consumer and also in areas like B2B?","Andy Cecere","Yes. It is.","Terry Dolan","Yes. I think one of the other things that kind of ties into that is continuing to enhance and to improve our anti-digital marketing sort of capabilities into that all digital strategy, data analytics and a lot of those other things that will help drive growth in the future.","Betsy Graseck","And when we think about the impact on the P&L, the improvement in digital and improvement in real-time is, obviously, very positive for clients. Does it -- how does it impact your P&L? Is it neutral? Do you give up slowed, but get back volume? I\u2019m just trying to think through how you think about the ROIC and all of this?","Andy Cecere","Yes, Betsy, as I think about this, I think these enhancements to both revenue and expense. Because from a revenue standpoint, I think, it is going to allow for additional customer acquisition as well as retention, building the customer from a centrality standpoint. On the expense side of the equation , I think, it offers operational efficiencies. If you think about check processing, carrier cost and things of all those source of things, overtime, I think, it will offer benefits on both sides.","Betsy Graseck","And the flows give up really is in that bigger deal?","Andy Cecere","No the flow \u2013 there\u2019s positive and negative with that. And I think the negative is not going to be that material.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Andy Cecere","Good morning, Vivek.","Vivek Juneja","Good morning. A couple of questions for you. One is, did I cash this correctly the prepaid cards, the accounting change in the first quarter of 2018 that benefited by 400 basis points or did I miss to hear that?","Terry Dolan","Yes, the impact was favorable a year ago. So it actually had a negative impact to the growth rate this year of about 400 basis points. If you think about we\u2019re down 6.2%, there was a 500 basis point drag where I did three fewer processing days, 400 basis points drag related to the accounting change, and then the drag associated with the consumer spend dynamics that we saw early in the first quarter.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. And that favorable accounting change, Terry, did that benefit all of 2018 then or is this something that reversed in the rest of 2018? How did it play out?","Terry Dolan","No, it was a onetime item in the first quarter of 2018, so it was one time. So it won\u2019t impact anything related to our future quarters from a comparison standpoint.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. Got It. And this 500 basis point fuel processing days that should completely reversal with the course of the next quarter or is it take multiple quarters to do that?","Terry Dolan","Yes, it is not necessarily in the second quarter. We would expect it to reverse principally in the third quarter. By year-over-year basis, 2019 versus 2018 they\u2019re actually two fewer processing days in total. So we\u2019re going to get some of it back, but not all of them this year.","Vivek Juneja","Yes, okay. Okay, great. Thank you.","Terry Dolan","You bet.","Andy Cecere","Thanks for that.","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Kevin Barker","Good morning. I just want to follow up on some of the comments you made about commercial real estate, is it feels like there is a distinct shift here as we go into 2019 versus the outlook for the competitive environment that we saw on the latter half of 2018. You mentioned in where we are in the business cycle in some of your remarks, I am just wanted to get a little more color on where you\u2019re seeing either outsized competition now or maybe some softness in certain parts of the commercial real estate market.","Terry Dolan","Yes. So we\u2019re certainly seen, I think with respect to the capital markets with rates coming down we saw, I think, opportunity for some of that project financing to be refinanced in the first quarter. I think that\u2019s part of it. We\u2019re also seeing insurance companies, pension plans that have been a little more active with respect to taking out construction lending and providing the permanent financing maybe then what we have seen in the past.","Fourth quarter was a little bit of an anomaly for us, because the first quarter kind of got \u2013 some of the first quarter activity got pulled forward into the fourth order. But when we think about commercial real estate, going through the rest of the year the type of pay down activity, I think we expect it to continue.","So, the coin in the portfolio is probably going to be fairly consistent through the year. In terms of type of product, in terms of where we\u2019re seeing it, I just really kind of across the board in terms of all the different areas, but it\u2019s really from construction to that permanent financing stage. And part of that is, we\u2019re at this particular point in the business cycle, we\u2019re just not willing to extend out terms and go deeper with respect to commercial real estate at this particular point in time.","Andy Cecere","And just to add on Terry, another factors certainly is the flat yield curve. It\u2019s allowing some of these nonbanks to take advantage of the lower funding cost in the spots in the curve\u2026","Terry Dolan","Yes.","Andy Cecere","That we typically would go.","Terry Dolan","Yes.","Kevin Barker","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then to follow up on some of the comments around in the mobile strategy, you introduced the small business mobile app and from the lending you did last year. Can you just give an update on the progress that you\u2019ve seen from that rollout, what the growth looks like and what it has done incrementally to your overall loan growth.","Andy Cecere","Yeah. So we spent a \u2013 I mentioned the agile teams, that was a great example of the agile team coming together in a matter of months to develop a product that allowed for funding and what was typically days or weeks to hours. And it\u2019s in early innings of the project, but it\u2019s been very favorable in terms of offering customers convenient choice. Your questions before the approval process to get them approved, funding much more rapidly and it\u2019s all part of the mobile app activity that we talked about that allows for just a more convenient, simple or set of navigation options and also sales and information.","So it\u2019s part of a larger strategy. And also I want to highlight that the mobile app that we are introducing out it\u2019s just phase one. It will continue to be updated and enhanced and you\u2019ll see more and more of these capabilities. I also mentioned in my prepared remarks that currently 75% of our mortgage apps are now done in a digital fashion end-to-end which is a huge improvement and a great convenience from a customer standpoint.","Terry Dolan","And I think that is one of the drivers in terms of why we are seeing application really stronger, and it\u2019s one of the reasons why we feel pretty bullish on mortgage origination through the rest of the year.","Kevin Barker","Okay. Thank you Andy and thank you Terry.","Andrew Cecere","Yes.","Terry Dolan","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Your line is open.","Saul Martinez","Hey, good morning guys. A couple of questions, sort of granular questions. First on your deposit service charges of $217 million. Obviously, it\u2019s not comparable to the prior quarters because of the ATM processing, the ATM sale \u2013 business sale, which had been consolidated in prior quarters. And I think it was in there one month in the fourth quarter, but my understanding is that not all of that goes away.","So how do I think about the $217 million on a like-for-like basis versus previous quarters versus the fourth quarter and the first quarter. I think they were doing like $45 million a quarter, but what kind of adjustments do we need to make to the prior quarters to get more of an apples to apples comparison?","Terry Dolan","Yes, the ATM business was sold of mid fourth quarter. So the change and deposit service charges fourth, excuse me, first quarter to first quarter is a pretty good metric or indicator with respect to the type of impact that it will have on deposit service charges going forward. And I think that\u2019s probably the best way of kind of thinking about it.","Saul Martinez","Okay. So, sorry. So the best ways to sort of look at the year-on-year Delta versus where it was in the first quarter of 2018.","Terry Dolan","So the Delta was about $44 million, $45 million, I think the Delta is a pretty good metric.","Saul Martinez","Okay. So it\u2019s a about $40 million to $45 million. So not all of it goes away from what you previously were posting in that ATM processing services line, which was like $80 million to $90 million a quarter.","Terry Dolan","That\u2019s right. Because it included in that was third party service provider fees as well as that branded ATM fees.","Saul Martinez","Got it. And then on your C&I loan yields, it tipped up quite a bit this quarter. They were up like 30, almost 30 basis points, I think 29 basis points, which is fairly high even in a quarter where you have a hike and LIBOR obviously moved up. The average LIBORmoved up less than in prior quarters, if anything unusual in that tick up and commercial loan yields that we should be aware of or it seems like a pretty big increase.","Terry Dolan","Yes, typically I think you would expect to see about maybe 60% of the rate hike that would be probably more normal, so maybe in that 20 basis points. The rest of it is really kind of driven by the mix of the growth in the portfolio. So it\u2019s really more of a mix issue.","Saul Martinez","Okay. So you get some rate hike and then you\u2019re benefiting obviously I guess from the mix as well.","Terry Dolan","Exactly. Yes.","Saul Martinez","All right. Okay. Got It. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Mike Mayo","Hi, can you hear me?","Terry Dolan","Yes, Mike.","Andy Cecere","Yes, Mike.","Mike Mayo","Great, so I know Betsy asked one question about Derek White, I guess comes from BBVA, which is considered one of the leaders in digital banking. That\u2019s a pretty big higher. So what metrics should we on the outside look to see if the digital banking effort will be successful? Say in one, two or three years, is it percentage of customers that are engaged digitally? Is it customer satisfaction? What would be your metrics for success for whatever Derek White will be doing there?","Andy Cecere","Thanks Mike. And it is all those things, it\u2019s digital engagement. It\u2019s going to be sales activity and be as a digital platform. It\u2019s going to be customer activity via digital platform and we\u2019re going to share more of those with you on this call and in our quarterly earnings and starting with what we did today because it is something we\u2019re very focused on from a company perspective and because we\u2019re focused on, I want to make sure you\u2019re aware of it.","Mike Mayo","And you were \u2013 I think pretty recently said you might be going out of footprint with some digital banking efforts, kind of joining in on the national digital banking wars, so to speak. That\u2019s my term, not yours. But it does seem like everyone\u2019s doing that around the same time. How does this hiring impact your plans to go out of market for more retail customers?","Andy Cecere","That is still our plan. And as a reminder, we have a number of customers outside of our 25 states that are either credit card, mortgage or on loan customers. We also have large employee bases. And I think what we\u2019re focused on is expanding and what I\u2019ll call it digital light strategy, branch light strategy, digital first strategy, which is with a few branches with this digital capability that we\u2019re talking about and encompassing the current customer base and becoming a more full bank experience for those customers.","Mike Mayo","And then one short follow-up by last one. You\u2019ve been around a long time, the industry and the business, it\u2019s just we haven\u2019t found too many examples of cross selling to a credit card company. A lot of other say deposit and other products. You are changing a single product customer, whether it\u2019s in credit cards or auto and making them a full relationship customer. So why is now different? Or maybe there\u2019s examples that you see that I don\u2019t.","Terry Dolan","Yes, a fair question, Mike. I think what\u2019s changed over the past few years is the capabilities that you can do from a digital platform. So historically, you really need a physical presence to expand the customer relationship. And if you didn\u2019t have a branch in that location or many branches, the density of branches, you weren\u2019t able to really extend the relationship. I think with the capabilities today, the two thirds of transactions happen on a mobile device. The fact that 70% of our customers use the digital platform, all those facts allow you to enter a market with this branch light concept with a digital platform that is different from a few years ago. And I think that\u2019s the major change.","Mike Mayo","All right, thank you.","Andy Cecere","Yeah. I think the other thing that I would add is that I think a big part of the digital world is the experiential aspect associated with it. And if you think about Millennials and Gen Z et cetera, being much more digitally attempt, and I think that \u2013 as that continues to occur, it\u2019s going to continue to create that opportunity.","Mike Mayo","Thanks again.","Andy Cecere","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your lines is open.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you, good morning. Andy and Terry, how are you?","Andy Cecere","Good morning, Gerard.","Terry Dolan","Doing well.","Gerard Cassidy","Could you guys share with us, obviously credit quality is very strong throughout the industry and for you folks as well, are there any issues on the horizon that you\u2019re keeping your eye on that we should be aware of just as a general trend on credit and then also as you answered that question, can you think about also your exposure to retail malls in the stuff that\u2019s increased activity and retailers shutting down stores and maybe there might be some pressure in that type of portfolio down the road?","Terry Dolan","Yeah, good question. Certainly with respect to our portfolio, there\u2019s nothing really on the horizon that we\u2019re too concerned about as you know that our portfolio is principally prime based and that\u2019s true across all of our consumer sort of product and on the commercial side of the equation typically is an investment grade, high investment grade type of customers that we do business with.","So I don\u2019t think there is a particular areas that we have that it stands out as a concern for us, certainly in commercial real estate. And one of the reasons why we\u2019re not extending terms and those sorts of things is just that at this particular point in the business cycle, we think it\u2019s prudent just to continue to hold our own as opposed to expand and grow.","And then maybe coming back to your question with respect to retail malls, it \u2013 I think that will continue to be an area of pressure if you think about the industry. But for us, the exposure I believe is less than $250 million. So it just isn\u2019t a big exposure for us at this particular point in time.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then shifting to deposit betas back in 1994, 1995, Chairman Greenspan shifted his policy and interest rates from raising rates to cutting rates within six months in 1995. If Chairman Paul decides to cut fed fund rates this fall and some futures markets are suggesting he might do that. How quickly would your deposit betas start to fall following the Fed reducing short end rates?","Terry Dolan","As soon as the rate starts moving down, we and I think the industry would be fairly proactive in terms of bringing deposit pricing down along with it.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. Thank you.","Terry Dolan","Yeah. Thanks, Gerard.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon, Eastern Daylight Time, through Wednesday, July 26 at 12 o'clock midnight Eastern Daylight Time.","I will now turn the conference call over to Jen Thompson of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.","Jen Thompson","Thank you, Melissa and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Andy Cecere, Terry Dolan and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's second quarter results and to answer your questions. Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.","I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Andy.","Andy Cecere","Thanks, Jen. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call. I am going to start off by discussing a few highlights from our second quarter earnings results. Terry will then go into some details and also provide you with forward-looking guidance, and after that, we'll take your questions.","I'll start with Slide 3 of the presentation. In the second quarter, we reported net income of $1.5 billion or $0.85 per diluted share. You will see on the slide that our balance sheet is strong and growing, sequential loan growth came in at the high end of our guidance range at 0.9%. As expected, C&I loan growth picked up after a sluggish start to the year and gained momentum towards the end of the second quarter. Based on current trends we expect that by the third quarter total loan growth will be back to the 1% to 1.5% range we think that is more normalized.","Credit quality remains excellent and we feel good about the risk profile of the loan portfolio. The net charge-off ratio was stable in the second quarter and our non-performing asset ratio improved on both, the linked quarter and year-over-year basis.","Shifting to capital management; our book value per share ended the quarter at $25.55 which was up 4.8% from a year ago. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio estimated for the Basel III fully implemented standardized approach was 9.3% at 6.30 [ph], the level which is sufficient to support growth effectively managed through periods of economic stress and returned capital to our shareholders. In June, the Federal Reserve Bank notified us that they did not object to our capital plans submitted during the CCAR process. We subsequently announced the dividend increase of 7.1% and a new share repurchase program for the year.","Now let me touch on our key performance ratios. We turn to Slide 4, our return on average assets for the second quarter was 1.35%, our return on common equity was 13.4%, and our efficiency ratio was 55.2%. We're proud of our industry cleaning profitability metrics that we're always striving to improve. Although consistently best-in-class, our efficiency ratio has been at the higher end of its historical range in the past few quarters, primarily reflecting increased personnel and technology cost related to the regulatory compliance programs. However, we are nearing the end of the build out of these programs and believe the growth rates of these costs will begin to moderate. We expect compliance costs to grow at a pace more in-line with the company's core expense space in late 2017 and into 2018.","When we look out through the remainder of the year we expect to deliver positive operating leverage in both the third and fourth quarters of 2017 on a year-over-year basis. We further expect that the year-over-year non-interest expense growth will be in-line with our long-term target range of 3% to 5%. We believe that our strong balance sheet, diversified revenue mix and our focus on expense management combined with participation in some significant expense headwinds provides momentum for the second half for this year and into 2018.","Let me stop there and turn it over to Terry.","Terry Dolan","Thank you, Andy. If you turn to Slide 5, I'll start with the balancing review and follow-up with the discussion of second quarter earnings trends. In the second quarter average loans increased 0.9% on a linked quarter basis and grew 3.4% from a year ago. Commercial loan growth rebounded from the first quarter increasing 2% sequentially. Line utilization has not increased materially, however, deal activity has strengthened and we continue to gain market share.","As Andy mentioned, large corporate lending, there are momentum in the latter part of the quarter. Additionally, throughout the quarter we continue to see strong growth in middle market lending across many geographies. Commercial real estate lending reflects our prudent approach to certain CRE segments such as multi-family and retail given current market conditions. We did have opportunities for growth in construction lending. However, remain cautious in commercial mortgage markets where the competitive environment has created unfavorable conditions from a risk and return standpoint.","In addition customers continue to refinance commercial mortgages in the capital markets given the rising rate environment and opportunity to extend maturities. We had particularly strong growth in retail leases as far as up 11% linked quarter where both a prime lender and a less or in the auto segment and our well established market position, full product offering and a strong dealer relationships that provided strong growth in both lending and leasing. We have made significant investments in this business over the past few years which is coming to fruition in the form of increased market penetration with both dealers and manufacturers. We expect growth will remain healthy for the next few quarters as we continue to penetrate market.","I want to emphasize that leasing growth is not coming at the expense of increased risk. If you look at Slide 6, credit metrics remain very stable in our retail leasing portfolio. We have not changed our underwriting in this business and are not enhancing residual values. I would also highlight that in the second quarter the weighted average cycle score on originations for auto leases was 782.","Turning to Slide 7, total average deposits increased 0.8% compared with the first quarter of 2017 and 7.7% on the year-over-year basis. Following the June interest rate hike, our total interest bearing deposit is in the mid 20% range. As future rate hikes occur we would expect the beta will gradually trend towards 50% level.","On Slide 8 you will see the credit quality was relatively stable in the quarter, net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans was 49 basis points in the second quarter and non-performing assets declined by 9.8% on the linked quarter basis.","I will now move on to earnings results. Slide 9 provides highlights of second quarter results versus comparable periods. Second quarter net income of $1.5 billion was up 1.8% compared with the first quarter but was down 1.4% versus the second quarter of 2016. As a reminder, the second quarter of 2016 including two notable items; a $180 million Visa Europe gain in non-interest income and a $150 million non-interest expense related to interest accruals and a charitable contribution.","Excluding these items net income increased slightly year-over-year. I will exclude the impact of these notable items when I discuss revenue and expense comparison versus the second quarter of 2016.","Turning to Slide 10, revenue totaled a record $5.5 billion, up 3.1% on a linked quarter basis and 4.2% higher compared with the same quarter a year ago.","Turning to Slide 11, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $3 billion in the second quarter, up 2.4% compared with the first quarter and 5.9% higher than the second quarter of 2016. Comparisons in both quarters benefited from earning asset growth and higher interest rates. In the second quarter the net interest margin increased one basis point to 3.04% in-line with our guidance. The increase was primarily driven by rising interest rates partially offset by the impact of a flatter yield curve and higher cash balances which increased to meet certain regulatory expectations related to liquidity. We do not expect average cash balances to increase meaningfully from current levels.","Slide 12 highlights trends in non-interest income which increased 3.9% versus the first quarter reflecting seasonally higher revenue, particularly in the payment services business. On the year-over-year basis, non-interest income increased 2% excluding notable items. Credit and debit card revenue increased 7.8% from a year ago on higher sales volumes. Merchant acquiring revenue grew 2.7% on a year-over-year basis adjusted for the impact of currency rate changes.","In the second quarter we exited two merchant acquiring joint ventures which did not have a material impact on the second quarter results but will mute revenue growth comparisons for the next few quarters. Divestitures were in part -- due in part to changing priorities of the joint venture partners that were impacting future growth and profitability portfolios for us. Mortgage revenue grew about 2.4% on a linked quarter basis but declined 10.9% year-over-year, in-line with our expectations.","Turning to Slide 13, non-interest expense increased 2.7% compared with the first quarter of 2017, primarily reflecting higher compensation expense and marketing and business development expense, partially offset by seasonally lower employee benefit expenses. On a year-over-year basis non-interest expense increased 6.4% excluding notable items, were also driven by higher compensation and other non-interest expense. Compensation expense grew mainly due to the impact of hiring to support business growth and compliance programs, as well as seasonal merit increases in higher variable compensation related to production. Other expenses increased primarily due to be impact of the FDIC insurance surcharge which began in the third quarter of 2016.","Slide 14 highlights our capital position. At June 30, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented was 9.3%. This compares to our capital target of 8.5%.","I will now provide some forward-looking guidance for the third quarter. Given recent trends, we expect linked quarter total loan growth to be in the 1% to 1.5% range. Average earning asset growth will track with loan growth. We expect the linked quarter net interest margin to increase in a manner similar to the first quarter of 2017 which is within a range of four to five basis points.","Let me take a minute to talk about merchant acquiring revenue. Last quarter we indicated that during the third quarter merchant acquiring revenue was expected to return to a more normal growth trajectory of same-store sales plus 1% to 2% excluding the impact of foreign currency changes. The adverse impact on sales volumes from exiting certain large volume customers is beginning to dissipate with reported sales volumes increasing 3.3% on a linked quarter basis. Given the anticipated revenue impact from exiting the joint ventures, we expect year-over-year merchant acquiring revenue will be essentially flat in the third quarter. Growth will begin to normalize in the fourth quarter and then heading into 2018.","As Andy discussed, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage in each of the next two quarters supported by year-over-year expense growth of 3% to 5%, a level we target as more normalized on a long-term basis. Finally, we expect the taxable equivalent tax rate to approximate 29% in the third quarter.","Let me hand it back to Andy for closing comments.","Andy Cecere","Thanks, Terry. Our financial performance gained momentum in the second quarter and we expect to continue to improve profitability and returns as we look in the second half of this year and head into 2018. From a macro perspective, corporate balance sheets are strong, consumer confidence is increasing and the evolving economic and regulatory backdrop has to promise to be conducive to growth. I just spent time in Washington last week and was very encouraged by the open and productive dialogue that has taken place; nonetheless, progress has been slower than any had hoped.","While we have not yet seen evidence of a resurgence in the CapEx cycle, consumers are spending and businesses are active, and we continue to ensure across our geographic markets and business lines. We have a solid and growing revenue base and we believe we have reached an inflection point in expense growth. Importantly, the profit improvement that we expect will drive improving returns will not be achieved as the expense but at the cost of credit quality nor will be achieved at the cost of delaying prudent business investment which will be increasingly focused on technology and innovation.","Finally, I want to thank our dedicated employees who work hard every day to be our customers and communities trusted financial partner. That concludes our formal remarks. Terry, Bill and I will now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks, good morning. Just following up on the expense, rate of change; it's good to hear that it's anticipated that quickly. So I just wonder if you can help us just to understand -- when you're talking about both, 3Q and 4Q getting back down into that three to five; what things are getting better and what things are you still having any inflation underneath the surface?","Terry Dolan","Yes, so let me take that question. I think there is three broad things. From a compensation standpoint we expect that that will begin to moderate and continue to moderate third, fourth and into 2018 and that will be driven by the fact that we're getting close to the end of building out those risk and compliance programs, so that is kind of number one. Then cost related to risk and compliance such as like consulting activities; that are really have been helping us support some of those programs, has been moderating, it will continue to moderate as we go into the next few quarters and also into 2018. So those would be the biggest things and then a year ago FDIC implemented a surcharge and so we're starting to lap that and the year-over-year effect associated with the FDIC insurance will start to moderate.","Unidentified Analyst","And I'll keep my follow-up to expenses; and can you just help us understand the tax advantage investments and what does that mean for sequential growth as we go third, into fourth as well; it seems like you also had a bunch of that more in the other line this quarter. So can you just help us understand what that means for sequential growth as well? Thanks.","Terry Dolan","We don't necessarily talk about that specifically but we do typically see the tax credit amortization expense start to move up in the third and then the fourth quarter. I think last year from third to fourth as an example it was up about $40 million to $50 million kind of a net ballpark. So that should give you kind of some sort of a range with respect to how that's going to change.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks guys, appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question is from John Pancari with Evercore.","John Pancari","Good morning. Just around the deposit balance sheet again for the ended period, just want to get a little bit color on what drove that -- the end of period coming in above the average and some of the volatility there and how we should look at the deposit flows going forward?","Terry Dolan","Yes, so on a linked quarter basis if you're going to look at just averages, we saw growth in deposits, both in our consumer business and then also in our corporate trust business. We end up looking at the ending cash balances, keep in mind that one of the things we were doing as we were building cash balances in order to meet some of those liquidity requirements; and in order to be able to do that one of the things that we did is a little bit of a pricing change related to some sort of deposits in order to bring some dollars in near the end of the quarter, and so that's why you see that. Kind of on a go forward basis when you think about cash balances, we don't expect the average balances to change much from current levels.","Andy Cecere","That's right, Terry. And I'd add in any particular day that cash balance can be up or down, there is a lot about that particularly within the corporate trust business with flows that are there, so one day I think there is a designated trend during my [indiscernible].","John Pancari","Okay, so the average should remain where it is, so therefore the EOP is probably going to head back towards the level where it was?","Andy Cecere","Yes, it's an average balances.","John Pancari","Yes, got it, okay. And then on the margin, in terms of your expectation, could you remind me again, you had mentioned four to five basis points?","Terry Dolan","Yes. You know, our guidance for the -- going into the third quarter we expected to spend -- expand four to five basis points from here. And one of the things, just -- when we end up looking at the one basis point movement in the second quarter, we had guided that it would be lower. One of the big reasons for that is really building the higher cash balance as that cost has got two basis points during that quarter and the flatter yield curve cost us a little bit but when we look at third quarter we feel pretty comfortable with that range of four to five basis points.","John Pancari","Okay. And then jumping off from that point into fourth quarter, how much beyond that would you think barring incremental hikes then into '18 can be a good color? Thanks.","Terry Dolan","When we look into the fourth quarter, at least right now, we would expect that the margin increase may not be at the four to five but it's still going to be kind of in that range of three to four, some and above.","Andy Cecere","And we try this thing with the 90 days because so much can change with the yield curve in particular, so we'll continue to give guidance as we go to the next 90 days.","John Pancari","Yes, got it. Thanks, Andy. Thanks, Terry.","Operator","The next question is from Betsy Graseck.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning. I just had a couple of questions, little more on the strategic side. I just wanted to get your thoughts on some of the consolidation that's going on with merchant acquiring over in Europe and how that plays into your business over there, any thoughts on incremental investments that you would be looking to make as a result?","Andy Cecere","Right. So as you know Betsy, we're five or six both in North America, as well as Europe, we have a great platform, our dynamic currency conversion capabilities, our international payment platform; so I think we're well positioned in both places. Merchant acquiring is an area that we will continue to look for incremental acquisitions, I would call it more open bolt-on or add-on as opposed to major deals. We don't need to really expand or start in Europe because we already have a very strong presence, so -- but it is in an area of focused rest and one that continues to grow along, we continue to invest in.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then on the corporate trust side, could you give us some more updated comments there?","Andy Cecere","So corporate trust is having a good year, we continue to be leading market share across all three categories, muni, corporate, as well structured; we have again a good platform and good technology which I think is key to that business and we've been very consistent in terms of our commitment to that. So our opportunity is to continue to expand in the U.S. but also we have a foothold in Europe and our opportunity to expand there I think is comparable to where it was in the U.S. about 20 years ago.","Betsy Graseck","And then just lastly, you talked a bit about deposit betas and how they've been projecting; I just wanted to get a sense from you on how close to run rate you are on the corporate side of your business?","Terry Dolan","I think when you end up looking at deposit bidders overall, they talked a little bit about that. I do think that one of the things you're seeing on the wholesale side is that the deposit prices gain a little bit more competitive; and so we do see that picking up both in the June hike and as rate hikes continued in the future. And you know, I think that is going to continue to move up and as part of what we are so when we think about the positive bid as overall moving up closer to that 50 basis points, we're going to see more pressure on the wholesale side and on the corporate trust side.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. But it feels like we are two-thirds the way through or a third of the way through.","Terry Dolan","With respect to this rate hike?","Betsy Graseck","Yes.","Terry Dolan","I think we're probably further along on the wholesale side of the equation getting normalized betas and we have more space to go on the retail side which the beta there has been very low and we'll continue to go up as the next rate increases come forward.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. No, it was interesting just -- I asked the question because obviously we had a rate hike but yet you did a great job on non-sparing deposits growth in the quarter, and so it kind of suggested to me that maybe you were done on the corporate deposit beta side.","Terry Dolan","No, I don't know if we're done. I think that's all that we can really driven based upon what we see from a competitive standpoint but I don't think based upon the fact that we have cash balances where we're at, we don't necessarily see a need to drive deposits in. We're -- I would agree with you, I don't think there is a lot of upward pressure with respect to it. Deposit beta is both -- whether it's retail or wholesale etcetera, it's really tracking pretty similar to what we've seen in the past, maybe just a little bit higher.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Alright, thanks so much.","Operator","The next question is from [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. My first question is on loan growth, it sounds like the aggregate stuff is pretty much tracking as you would have thought that through the course that you're already indeed will accelerate back in your targeted range in the back half. So that's all good but it is kind of running a little contrary to the weakness we still see in the HA [ph]. Just curious if you can spend another moment or so just talking about exactly where it ends up coming from how much of it is market share versus [indiscernible]?","Andy Cecere","So I'll start and then I'll ask Bill to add on. You know the areas of growth continue to be in few -- middle market is doing exceptionally well, that's in excess of 2% on a linked quarter basis and we continue to see that accelerating or being about that level in future quarters, that's doing well. As Terry and I both mentioned, we saw some growth in the second half of the second quarter in the large corporate wholesale part of the category. And then a lot of leasing as Terry mentioned, very high quality but given the great platform relationships we had that shows some growth. So those are areas that I would say are our principal areas of focus.","Bill Parker","Yes, that pretty much hit on the consumer, we expect it to remain fairly strong through the latter half of the year, so we continue to see good demand in auto loans and leases; and again, that's very prime portfolio for us, we've always done it that way and we've stayed consistent in that area. We also using some demand on home equity, that's a tough market but we haven't seen the big increases, we do still have strong originations there. Andy talked about the commercial side; I will stay on the commercial real estate side although we do see some roll-off of our -- what we call our mortgage portfolio or standing loan portfolio, I guess it's very aggressive terms and by the life companies in the VS market. We are still an active construction lender, so we've seen growth there and we also -- our client base is a lot of reaps [ph] and much of that actually shows up in the C&I line and we're seeing good growth quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year there. So there is a lot of space where we're continuing to see good demand.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, that's perfect. I appreciate the color. And then just separately on -- just the idea of positive operating leverage; it looks like both the quarters in the back half of the year, we should get was just good. Just curious about your updated thoughts on positive frame leverage for the full year and sort of when you would expect to see that? I think you've previously been hoping to generate positive operating leverage for the full year '17; I guess just my rough cut on the updated guidance -- just now, it will still be a little bit of a challenge but just would be curious to hear your thoughts.","Andy Cecere","Scott, we'll get in third quarter and fourth quarter and we'll be very close if not on for the full year.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, sounds good. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning. Just a follow-up to Scott's question; as we look on longer term in terms of the progression of your efficiency ratio, if we presume this with either forward curve today; could we see U.S. Bancorp exit 2018 with an efficiency ratio in the low 50s?","Andy Cecere","Yes, it's a short answer to that question. We would expect to have positive operating leverage and closer to our long-term growth projections as move into '18 and that is what we talked about at Investor Day and that expense ratio in the 3% to 5% and revenue growth above that. Now that's assuming sort of a normal yield curve, economic growth is abnormally lower or anything like that but we would expect to continue to have that into '18.","Erika Najarian","That was very clear, thank you. The follow-up on some of the deposit question, some of your peers have noted that if the SAD [ph] does reduce its balance sheet or begin reducing its balance sheet by September, they believe that the outflows will be most vulnerable in wholesale deposits and I'm wondering what your color is on that -- your take is on that and whether or not that could potentially accelerate beta's even further for U.S. bank?","Terry Dolan","Yes, so let me take that. And so -- you know, the Fed is still kind of in the process defining what the level of balance sheet reduction and the pace of that overtime; and our expectation is that first of all, they're going to be very transparent as they go through that process and the pace is going to be very gradual, most likely several years. So we do believe that as -- kind of excess liquidity comes out of the market, we would expect there to be more competition for deposits and that is going to end up impacting pricing; I do believe that just because of the nature of the deposits on the wholesale side you're going to see more competitive and -- more of a competitive environment associated with that. Whether I'd be surprised if it's going to significantly impact 2017, and I do believe that just because it's going to be very gradual, it's going to also be very manageable and the market is going to respond accordingly.","Erika Najarian","Thank you. And just one last follow-up question; I know you always get asked on this call about an update for with the consent order and I'm wondering if I could ask a more technical question; is the consent order for OCC applicable to the holding company? And I'm just wondering whether or not there is a way to isolate the consent order to sort of unshackle it more strategically?","Andy Cecere","OCC obviously regulates our national banks, so that's where it is. But our national bank is essentially the holding company, I mean I think it's over 99% of the entire banks; so all the operations occur within that national bank. So what the OCC -- it really applies across the board.","Terry Dolan","Erika, we continue to expect to have our people in process who are in place, their technology will be completed by the end of the third, into the fourth quarter and then it gets to the sustainability and part of the equation and that goes into early '18.","Erika Najarian","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is Matt Connor [ph] with Deutsche Bank.","Ricky Dodds","This is actually Ricky from Matt's team. I'm wondering if I could just do a bigger picture question first. I wonder if you can touch on some of items on the growth front that you mentioned in the past, maybe it's in payments or in wealth penetration; maybe frame out what those could mean to revenue as we think about both, the rest of this year and into 2018 and beyond?","Andy Cecere","So I think our -- let me just sort of go across the business lines, yes, for high level; our wholesale continues to be an opportunity to expand our dominance in terms of being the bank of choice for large corporate customers. We have a number of capabilities we've built over the years and we continue to take market share in different categories, particularly in the commercial group as we move up the league tables. On the wealth management side, I do think the extension of corporate trust, as well as the wealth management piece of the pie, particularly were focused on the emerging [ph], that represents a great opportunity. Payments across all three categories, merchant acquiring, card issuing, as well as corporate payment systems; I think we have the technology and leaders to continue to grow that. I think particularly in regard to Elvan [ph], I think the opportunity is both here, as well as in Europe.","And then finally retail, we're doing very well in terms of small business as well as retail core customer growth. And so I think across all of our business lines as we've said many times before, I think we're in a strong position, and we're not really seeking to have major adjustments and just taking advantage of the opportunities we have in front of us.","Ricky Dodds","Okay, great. And the maybe separately, it seems like energy and maybe oil prices are starting to come back in the conversation a bit more; some analysts are calling for sun $40 oil prices by 2018. I'm just wondering if you can remind us again what your exposure in that space and does it seem like there is any real signs of deterioration in your portfolio? I'm wondering if you could talk again maybe about the quality.","Andy Cecere","Sure. Yes, I mean our book has been relatively modest in size, we do finance the energy sector but we're below 2% of our commitment level and less than 1% of our loans within that sector. When the original price decline took place we obviously did see some impact. This quarter NPAs were down in part because of some of the resolution of those original non-performing loans but we've been bringing our reserve levels down but it's not -- it's just not a material impact to our overall performance but we think the -- were at -- going to a $40 price tag, we think that's a comfortable place to be, so we expect to continue to see improvement in that portfolio.","Ricky Dodds","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And the next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","Vivek Juneja","Hi, couple of questions, and maybe this one goes to Bill. Credit card net charge-offs up 58 basis points year-over-year, turning a little higher than your peers; can you talk a little bit about what's going on there?","Bill Parker","Yes, sure. I mean I think that I'll start within -- the forward look is lower than that, right, it will come back down, it will be below 4%; so it's not a trajectory thing. I think what we see is that we have continued to grow that portfolio both with acquisitions and internally through our branches, it's been solid growth; so there is a seasoning impact and if you've probably seen that across the industry but we have -- we do have a seasoning impact there but our outlook is very solid, we haven't -- we've seen our underwriting to begin that growth.","Andy Cecere","And it's a crime portfolio across the board, there is no sub-prime activity there and we're not -- that's not something we're worried about.","Vivek Juneja","Okay, alright. Second topic, mortgage banking, you talked about that on last quarter's call. Terry, Andy in terms of -- your applications are pretty sharply, seems like gain on sale margins were down; can you give some color as to what's going on and what you expect to see on that?","Andy Cecere","Yes, so maybe just to talk about the second quarter first, mortgage applications on a year-over-year basis we're down about 16% for us and that's pretty much in line with what the market was experience and that's driven in large part by the right refinancing. Second quarter mortgage applications, we did see a nice movement up on a linked quarter basis; we end up looking into the third quarter, we would expect mortgage applications to continue to move higher, that is kind of seasonal effect and we also have a nice mix of retail and on the purchase mortgage side, so that seasonal impact will continue to see in the third quarter. Gain out of sale margins in the second quarter did come down, I think you saw that kind of in the industry, our expectation or outlook is that they will be relatively stable going into the third quarter.","Vivek Juneja","Okay, great, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next question is from Brian Klock with Keith, Bruyette, & Woods.","Brian Klock","Good morning. I wanted to just follow-up maybe a little finer tooth on the expense guidance. On the year-over-year basis, I mean would you think that anyway if we look at the 3% to 5% range, do you think that sequentially we're looking at expenses; especially I think Terry if you mentioned the impact of the amortization of -- well income housing tax credits, so should we be up most single digits on a sequential basis, third versus second?","Terry Dolan","Yes. I mean usually there is a little bit of a seasonal effect that comes into play with respect to the third quarter but I think that's a reasonable assumption when you think about the third quarter.","Brian Klock","Okay. And I now you talked about earlier the deposits and you know the expectation around just the seasonal, there is a season of run-off that comes back in the second half of the year; so cash balances on average you think will be unchanged. So with the recent issuances of some longer term debt are you planning to add anything else to the investment securities portfolio? Are you planning to keep the securities portfolio relatively flat?","Terry Dolan","Yes. We end up increasing the securities portfolio really kind of in-line with the overall balance sheet growth; so if you think about what average loan growth is going to look like -- our average earning assets really kind of tracks in a very similar manner, so we would be adding to the investment portfolio in order to be able to do that but that's kind of one way to think about.","Brian Klock","Alright, thanks for your time.","Operator","The next question is from Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez","Good morning, everybody, couple of questions. Just sort of closing the loop a little bit on the net interest margin in NII guide; the NIM guidance four to five basis points average loan growth, 1%, 1.5%; I guess this should -- you know, triangulating that into NII growth of getting the numbers of around -- I guess 3% to 4% sequential growth is -- it's a little bit higher than I thought but I just want to make sure I'm not missing something in terms of triangulating NIM into NII growth?","Andy Cecere","Yes. I know that you can do the math based on what we ended up laying out but I think that's a reasonable assumption.","Saul Martinez","Got it. Okay, perfect. Now I guess a little bit of a bigger picture question on [indiscernible] merchant acquiring business, sort of a follow-up to an earlier question; especially in light of some of the consolidation you're seeing in Europe. But we have heard and feel free to disagree with this but we have heard that from some that it feels like you're subscale in the acquiring business in both, the U.S. and Europe, and obviously you've exited some low MDR relationships, you've exited some JVs, but can you talk a little bit more about the business strategically in terms of where you see the opportunities and how you capitalize on those opportunities? Where do you see [indiscernible] getting into the entire payment space in the merchant acquiring space and how do you differentiate yourself and drive better growth on an ongoing basis?","Andy Cecere","So I think first on your scale question, I think we have sufficient scale to be very competitive. I think we've had that for a number of years. We're focused on the few areas, number one is verticals, I think as you think about the merchant processing business, it's migrating from a natural transaction business to an information business and being very focused on verticals and providing that information, it's usually important and we have a number of verticals; the travel industry, hotels, small realty retailers that I think we're very good at, healthcare is another one; so our focus is in that information and in terms of innovation and technology providing beyond the financial transaction, and as well as the expansion of our sales force, both domestically, as well as Europe. And then finally, the e-commerce side of the equation is another area of focus for us in terms of investment and growth.","Saul Martinez","Got it. And how do you feel like your e-commerce capabilities are now versus where you want them to be?","Andy Cecere","I think they are fine, I want them to be better.","Saul Martinez","Okay, alright, fair enough. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin Barker","Good morning. I just had a quick question on tax rate; you mentioned it was going to 29%, I'm right there on the third quarter, so it's been quite volatile over the last few quarters. Are you still sticking with the 27% to 28%, give or take range for this year and maybe longer term?","Terry Dolan","I think that when we end up looking at the tax rate on a tax equivalent basis on a long-term basis, you know just because of growth it's going to -- because of the marginal effect it's going to drift upwards, so when I end up looking at certainly the next few quarters and going into 2018, the 29% is certainly more reasonable.","Kevin Barker","Okay. And then in regards to growth, obviously commercial mortgage -- C&I has been the main driver of growth as we've seen in the last few years, it slowed recently here. When you look out the next one or two years do you feel like the consumer and retail lending will start to take the lead or do you feel like commercial lend -- C&I lending will continue to be strong over the next couple of years?","Terry Dolan","I think wholesale will continue growing as it is and I think we'll start to see a turnaround in retail; so we've had strong growth, we've seen another portfolio that we talked about, a little bit less in terms of the home equity in traditional retail loan areas but I think we'll start to accelerate in future periods and I think that's how we get to the more normalized long-term growth rates.","Kevin Barker","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, I just had a follow-up question. It's around the CCAR process and the ask and -- you know, really the question is around the dividend. I thought you had a nice increase in the dividend but yet you have one of the lowest volatility earning streams of the group and it feels like there might be some room to boost up the dividend component of the capital return. Just wondering how you're thinking through that.","Andy Cecere","Betsy, that's a fair question. So I think first of all, we're starting from one of the lower capital ratios; you're right that we have the lowest volatility and the lowest downturn in the stress environment, in fact, we still make money as you say but we're starting from a point that's not far away from what we think is our optimal capital structure, the 8.5% versus the just over 9% we are today, that's number one. Number two is, we're always wanting to make sure that we do -- that we are successful in the outcome of the CCAR process and then finally balancing between the buyback side of the equation and the dividend. What we've done is, what I would call continue -- very predictable continually steady growth and we would expect to continue that in the future. We might balance a little bit more but we will balance a little bit more towards increasing the dividend probably more than a buyback in future periods.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, alright, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning, thank you. Can you guys give us some additional color -- you touched on in your opening remarks about the commercial real estate markets, you're seeing possibly some weakness in the multi-family space; can you share with us is there any geographical areas that you see as more concerning for you at this time?","Andy Cecere","Well, I mean there are certainly some of the cities that have very strong multi-family growth and if you look at some of the rent forecast and there is plenty of companies to do this. They will see there are markets, some of the coastal markets of Boston, DC; where the forecasts are for either no or slightly decline in rent growth; and that doesn't mean we won't do projects there, we follow our client base and if they like the project, we like the project, we both will do something but some of the markets have seen a lot of multi-family, Minneapolis is another one where you got to be cautious about it.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. The second question was and I think you may have touched upon this and I apologize if you did; can you kind of give us your view of -- obviously, the Federal Reserve has made it clear that they're going to start unwinding their balance sheet and it will go into full speed operation in 2018. How are you guys looking at that and the impact it may have on deposits in the banking system and then for USP as well?","Terry Dolan","Gerard, thank you. We talked a little bit about that earlier but you know, when you end up looking at what the Feds -- the Fed still needs to kind of define a level of reduction in the balance sheet and really the pace of it and I think that they've been really transparent that that pace is really going to be gradual over several years and I think that that will cause any impacts of it to be very manageable on the banking industry. And as the market adjusts, I do think that as -- or we think as excess liquidity comes out of the market you could expect to see and you will expect to see more competition with respect to deposits, I would also expect that the long end of the curve on a relative basis would be a little bit higher; as a result some of their activities -- that have [indiscernible] from a deposit standpoint is most likely to come on the wholesale side of the equation.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then just lastly, you know, obviously you guys have industry leading profitability with your ROA and your ROE at the present levels. What -- is it going to be more the net interest margin improvement or the efficiency ratio when you look at how you're going to or could drive that higher? As you know in the past, your numbers were higher but is it more of a margin issue or is it more efficiency ratio or leverage; what are you guys looking out for the levers? Do you even take it higher than where it is today?","Terry Dolan","Gerard, I think it's both parts of the equation, it's accelerating revenue growth and moderating expense growth; positive operating leverage which will improve the efficiency ratio and ultimately improve ROA and ROE.","Gerard Cassidy","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. Just one question, the bottom of Slide 8 really stands out; and that U.S. bank has built reserves for the last six quarters whereas your peers even through 2Q for those that have reported continue to release those reserves. So could you talk about it as something in terms of the mix shift or the loan portfolio that's driving your ability to grow reserves, again when your peers are just not in that same position?","Andy Cecere","Well, one of the things you're looking at is that lot of the peers have larger energy exposure so they added more and like us, we can see improvement in this quarter so they may have released more reserves out of their energy book. And we're pretty much steady as she goes from a credit standpoint; so at this point in the cycle we have a very stable credit environment and we're still growing loans, so that's what we look at and we will add to reserves to support loan growth if you think about what they are for and they are for potential future losses out of your loan book and as you grow the loan book, that's what the reserve is for. So if we don't have big upswings, we're needing to add to reserves in a downturn like the energy portfolio. Then we're going to be adding for loan growth.","Bill Parker","Sorry about that, it's been a lot lower than everyone else and so simply stated if we're not adding a lot, we're also tracking a lot.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Then just a follow-up question for me. Andy, this concept of one U.S. bank which you've talked about I believe is in the annual report; as you think about the second half of this year there are any areas within your core businesses that stand out in terms of benefiting from this strategy as you work together under this one U.S. bank kind of a strategy?","Andy Cecere","Terry, has a long list, there are a number of initiatives across the company from the way we handle our call centers, the way we do innovation and the way we communicate with our customers, to how we share information among the business lines. So there are a number of initiatives and I would say it's probably our number one focus of the company right now.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","The final question is from [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, I just had a couple of small ones on the -- making sure we're getting the payment -- merchant cost JV, it's right in the model; so were there any pain associated with the exit either in 2Q or back half of the year? And then the second just in terms of the guide, I think you said your 3% FX adjusted growth now in merchant processing and you see that flat in 3Q; was that -- how -- is it the earnings -- is it like equity method accounting that was being booked or is there revenue and then we should think about some expense coming out also in P&L? And I guess last, maybe just curiosity -- which JVs are you exiting? I saw something about [indiscernible] but couldn't find the other.","Andy Cecere","So first I'm going to ask Terry to go on the other details, there was no material gain or loss in the second quarter as a result.","Terry Dolan","Yes, so if you just end up looking at and trying to think about the growth rates over the next couple quarters, certainly reported growth rate is about 2.7% excluding the foreign currency as we said. I'd also say that same-store sales percentages and organic business growth has generally been quite strong which I think is good to see, that gives us insights with respect to the future. Reporting growth sales have been impacted by three factors; we talked last quarter about exiting some large volume low margin customers, that's been muting sales volumes and that has been dissipating and it's getting behind us, and certainly will be behind us as we get into the end of the third quarter; and so we're starting to see sales volume starting to grow.","We are experiencing some margin compression in Europe because of interchange caps that were put into place late 2015, and that has continued to impact our year-over-year sort of growth rates and will continue to do impact at least through the third quarter if that will start to dissipate in the fourth quarter and then really be behind us as we get into 2018. And then the impact of exiting the two joint ventures will have an impact on merchant acquiring, really for the next several quarters as we think about the year. To kind of give us some, maybe specifics; when we look at the third quarter, we do expect the year-over-year growth rate for the third quarter to be essentially flat and that's essentially what we said. As I look into the fourth quarter, I do expect the fourth quarter year-over-year growth rate to be similar to what we saw in the second quarter of this current quarter. And then as we continue to see organic growth that we are experiencing, you know that will start to benefit us as we go into 2018.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. And are you able to disclose which JVs are not at this time?","Terry Dolan","Yes. I mean the one joint venture is related to our joint venture in Spain with Santander. And you know really, they've had changing priorities with respect to what they want to focus on; and as we think about Spain, it continues to be an area that has some economic challenges. So from our standpoint we really do believe that we have the opportunity to continue to grow in that market on our own with a focus on the right customers and I'd be very clear we're not exiting the market. With respect to the second joint venture, that is the joint venture with KeyCorp [ph], so we thought key merchant services; and in that situation our partner really wanted to focus on a third-party servicing arrangements and we respect that decision on their particular part. And we also say that we're retaining the clients that we believe will create the best growth opportunity for us as we move into the future.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you, that was very detailed and I appreciate the answers.","Operator","There are no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.","Jen Thompson","Thank you for listening to this review of our second quarter results. Please contact us if you have any follow-up questions.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Andy Cecere, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today approximately at noon EDT through Wednesday, April 23, at 12:00 o\u2019clock midnight EDT. I will now turn the conference call over to Sean O\u2019Connor, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.","Sean O\u2019Connor","Thank you, Tiffany, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s first quarter 2014 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during our prepared remarks. A copy of this slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today\u2019s presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Richard.","Richard Davis","Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our call. I\u2019ll begin our review of U.S. Bank\u2019s results with a summary of the quarter\u2019s highlights on Page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bank reported net income of $1.4 billion for the first quarter of 2014 or $0.73 per diluted common share. Total average loans grew year-over-year by 6% and as expected 1.3% or 5.2% annualized on a linked quarter basis.","We experienced strong loan growth \u2013 strong growth in total average deposits of 5.1% over the prior year and 0.2% linked quarter. Credit quality remained strong. Total net charge-offs decreased by 21.2% from the prior year and rose modestly on a linked quarter basis as expected due to the unusually high wholesale recoveries in the prior quarter. Non-performing assets excluding covered assets declined linked quarter by 1%. We continue to generate significant capital this quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated for the Basel III fully implemented standardized approach was 9% at March 31. We repurchased 12 million shares of common stock during the first quarter which along with our dividend resulted in a 67% return of earnings to our shareholders in the first quarter.","Slide 4 provides you with a 5-quarter history of our performance metrics, and they continue to be among the best in the industry. Return on average assets in the first quarter was 1.56%, and return on average common equity was 14.6%.","Moving over to the graph on the right, you can see that this quarter\u2019s net interest margin was 3.35%. Andy will discuss the margin in more detail in just a few minutes. Our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 52.9%. We continue to manage our operating expenses effectively and in line with revenue trends. We expect that this ratio will remain in a low 50s going forward and as we continue to manage expenses in relation to revenue trends, while continue to invest in and grow our businesses.","Turning to Slide 5. The company reported total net revenue in the first quarter of $4.8 billion, a 1.2% decrease from the prior year and 1.5% decrease from the previous quarter. The decline in revenue year-over-year was largely driven by lower mortgage banking revenue while the linked quarter variance reflected normal first quarter seasonality within our business lines. Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 6. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $13 billion or 6% year-over-year and 1.3% linked quarter. Overall, excluding covered loans, a run-off portfolio, average total loans grew by 7.6% year-over-year and 1.7% linked quarter.","Once again, the increase in average loans outstanding was supported by strong growth in average total commercial loans, which grew by 8.5% year-over-year and 2.8% over the prior quarter. Total average commercial real estate also increased over the prior quarters, with average loans growing by 7.6% year-over-year and 1.9% linked quarter.","Residential real estate loans continue to show strong growth, 14.4% year-over-year and 1.7% over the prior quarter. Within the retail loan category, average credit card loans and auto loans and leases were higher both year-over-year and linked quarter while average home equity lines and loans continue to decline. The rate of decline in this category however has slowed considerably over the past few quarters.","We continue to originate and renew new loans and lines for our customers, new originations excluding mortgage production plus new and renewed commitments totaled approximately $35 billion in the first quarter. Total average revolving commercial and commercial real-estate commitments continue to grow at a faster pace than loans increasing year-over-year by 11.7% and 3.4% on a linked quarter basis. Line utilization remains at low levels and was approximately 23% in the first quarter.","Total average deposits increased by over $12 billion or 5.1% over the same quarter of last year. On a linked quarter basis, average deposits increased by 0.2% with growth in low cost savings deposits particularly strong on a linked quarter basis.","Turning to Slide 7, in credit quality. Total net charge-offs declined 21.2% on a year-over-year basis and rose modestly on a linked quarter basis due to unusually higher wholesale recoveries in the prior quarter. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 0.59% in the first quarter. Non-performing assets excluding covered assets decreased by 1% on a linked quarter basis and 11.6% from the first quarter of 2013. During the first quarter we released $35 million of reserves, equal to the reserve released in the previous quarter and $5 million more than the first quarter of 2013. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect net charge-offs and total non-performing assets to remain relatively stable in the second quarter of 2014.","Andy will now give you few more details about our first quarter results.","Andy Cecere","Thanks Richard. Slide 8 gives you a view of our first quarter 2014 versus comparable time periods. Our diluted EPS was $0.73, was equal to the first quarter of 2013 and $0.03 lower than the previous quarter.","The key drivers of the company\u2019s first quarter earnings are summarized on Slide 9. The $31 million or 2.2% decrease in net income year-over-year was principally due to a decrease in mortgage banking revenue partially offset by lower provision for credit losses.","Non-interest income was essentially flat year-over-year as the increases in average earning assets was offset by a decrease in net interest margin. The $12.2 billion growth in average earning assets year-over-year included increases in average total loans as well as planned increases in securities portfolio. Offsetting the portion of the growth in these categories was $6.1 billion reduction in average loans held for sale reflecting lower mortgage origination activity versus the same quarter of last year and a $3.8 billion reduction in average other earning assets, primarily due to the reconsolidation of a number of community development entities in the second quarter of 2013.","The net interest margin of 3.35% was 13 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to growth in the investment portfolio and lower rates on loans partially offset by lower rates on deposits and short-term borrowings and a reduction in higher cost long-term debt. Non-interest income declined by $57 million or 2.6% year-over-year, primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue, which reflected lower origination and sales revenue. Growth in several fee categories partially offset the decline in mortgage banking revenue including growth in retail payments, merchant processing, trust and investment management fees, deposit service charges, commercial products revenue, investment product fees and other income which was driven by higher equity investment revenue.","Non-interest expense increased year-over-year by $74 million or 3%, the increase was primarily the result of higher compensation expense and an increase in other expense which was driven by insurance related recoveries in the first quarter of 2013 partially offset by lower tax-advantaged project cost and lower cost related to other real estate loan.","Net income was lower on a linked quarter basis by $59 million or 4.1% mainly due to seasonally lower fee revenue partially offset by lower non-interest expense. On a linked quarter basis, net interest income was lower due to the impact of two fewer days and seasonally lower loan fees, partially offset by higher average earning assets. The net interest margin of 3.35% was 5 basis points lower than the fourth quarter, principally due to growth and lower rate investment securities, loan mix and lower loan fees.","On a linked quarter basis, non-interest income was lower by $48 million or 2.2%. This unfavorable variance was primarily due to seasonally lower retail payments and deposit service charges as well as lower commercial products revenue. Partially offsetting the decline in these revenue categories was an increase in corporate payments, trust and investment management fees and other income which was driven by higher equity investment and retail leasing revenue. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense declined by $138 million or 5.1%, driven by lower professional services costs, costs related to tax-advantaged projects and marketing and business development costs.","Turning to Slide 10. Our capital position is strong and continues to grow. Beginning January 1, 2014 the regulatory capital requirements effective for the company follow Basel III subject to certain transition provisions from Basel I over the next four years to full implementation by January 1, 2018. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using Basel III fully implemented standardized approach at March 31, was 9% up from 8.8% at December 31. At 9%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement.","Our tangible book value per share rose to $14.99 at March 31, representing an 13% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 4% increase over the prior quarter. In March, we received the results of our 2014 Comprehensive Capital Assessment Review the CCAR including the Federal Reserve\u2019s non-objection to our capital plan. Subsequently we announced our new one year buyback authorization totaling $2.3 billion, effective April 1, and our intention to recommend to our board of directors a 6.5% increase in our common stock dividend at our June Board Meeting.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Richard.","Richard Davis","Thanks Andy. And to conclude our formal remarks, I turn your attention to Slide 12. Extending the advantage, words from the cover of our annual reports that appropriately describe our strategy for 2014.

Your first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets.","Jon Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hey, good morning guys.","Richard Davis","Good morning, Jon.","Jon Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Richard, can you give us an update on some of your loan growth expectations and maybe touch a little bit on [inaudible] changes in terms of what\u2019s driving some of the commercial growth?","Richard Davis","Be happy to. Thanks Jon. First of all, as you see our linked quarter was 1.3% and we have been saying we\u2019re in that range of 1% to 1.5%. Based on our ending period not just our average and based on what we\u2019re seeing, I\u2019ll expect that range to continue at quarter two at the high end. So, we\u2019re actually seeing some slight [inaudible] continued improvement along the way. Now, we\u2019re seeing it across the board, so wholesale as you\u2019ve seen in the last many quarters has been driving the majority of that and that continues, leverage lending in middle market remain mostly active as well as loan growth in the western markets particularly the Western United States for wholesale and then seasonal increases in food, ag and in the retail groups.","So, we\u2019re seeing seasonality and continued market share growth which is not going to be stunning but at the high end of 1 to 1.5 that continue to show a trajectory and we think market share improvement. ","Commercial real estate, Jon, strong on both coasts as it has been in the past both East and the West as well as Texas particularly in new construction and some investment decisions being made by some of our customers. The most active cities are Seattle, San Francisco, LA and Orange County, so that stays pretty much West Coast focused. ","This quarter we have strong loan production in small businesses up almost 30% over last year\u2019s first quarter, that\u2019s all types of small business particularly for those under $250,000 and SBA itself was up more than 50% over the last year\u2019s same quarter. So, we\u2019re seeing small business and I think something slightly more than what you might expect to see in seasonality.","Residential mortgages, we said is off from its record highs but the portfolio continues to grow. Home equity, while we see that continuing to be the softest spot as we are sliding to get enough acquisition to offset the runoff we had a very strong March, which takes me some good hope in this second quarter particularly as we introduce some new programs and some pricing in order to encourage that behavior in the spring.","And then lastly, auto loans and credit cards, they\u2019re both growing. As you know we indicated a number of quarters ago that we\u2019re going to double our auto loan production in the indirect auto loan and lease and we are doing just that, we\u2019re right on track. And to give you an idea, our quarter one production for this last quarter was up 33% from the same time last year and we continue to see our rankings and market share starting to move as we hope that it would. And in credit cards, the year-over-year also stronger, credit up 9%, debit up 6%, and prepaid up over 20%. So, I would say it continues to give me optimism that we can stay on the high end of that range and continue to see that getting stronger. I know last quarter I said we think that second half will be stronger than the first half, we still believe that as well.","And I\u2019ll close with one my reasons for that belief is I think the Fed in their current messaging continues to allow people to believe that we\u2019re getting closer and closer to the moment in time when rates will move up. And I think our customers are starting to demonstrate behavior and getting really prepared for that moment and eventually they will use these unused lines of credit, they\u2019ll use their deposits and they\u2019ll start getting more lines on loans to I think accommodate that growth which is probably a few years out but may starting at the last half of 2014. How is that for a brief answer to a quick one?","Jon Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","That\u2019s wonderful. I don\u2019t want to hog the time on the call here but just one more thing and maybe it\u2019s related but in terms of the capital plan in the building your capital ratios and the 60% to 80% range, what is the plan for the capital that\u2019s not returned to shareholders? Do you want to continue to build capital on the balance sheet? Is this \u2013 are you just signaling that maybe there is a little bit faster growth coming, there\u2019s more acquisitions coming? Just help us understand whether or not you want capital to build or not and how you plan to utilize the excess?","Andy Cecere","Hi, Jon. This is Andy. First, if you think about the fourth quarter to the first quarter, part of the reason that \u2013 two reasons for the increase, number one is our unrealized loss went to an unrealized gain position with our securities portfolio because they\u2019re lower rates and that will change by about $300 million. The second thing is partly offsetting our buybacks in the first quarter was an exceptionally high level of stock exercise, stock option exercises from our employee base, I wouldn\u2019t expect it to continue at that level. So, my expectation Jon, is that this is sort of the highpoint, our normal earning asset growth, loan growth that Richard spoke to as well as our expected closure of the RBS transaction, the branches will drive that down in quarters two and three. And big picture, what will accommodate the reinvestment is our earning asset growth.","Bill Parker","The only thing to add Jon we don\u2019t [like] [ph] capital so we\u2019re real careful about that as you know. And in addition to what Andy said we want to continue to have a little powder for acquisition, you saw we did a small [indiscernible] with Ally, Custodian Trust on Monday and we\u2019ll continue to look for particularly payment and trust opportunities and we are still investing a lot I mean, the one thing we\u2019re not doing and it be easy to do in times whenever things are not as sustainable is stop the investment in things like R&D. And our payments business particularly mobile, we\u2019re spending a lot of time and energy and money getting sure that we have the best ideas the next new emerging protocol for customers and we\u2019re not cutting back on those investments in this case because we think it\u2019s going to be important to stay true to that. So, the retained earnings we\u2019ll use for ourselves as well small acquisitions.","Jon Arfstrom \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. All right. That helps. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America","Good morning.","Richard Davis","Hi, Erika.","Andy Cecere","Good morning, Erika.","Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America","My first question, Andy, I was wondering if you could give us an update on where you stand with regards to the LCR and how we should think about securities purchases from here? And maybe help us understand how earning assets grows as you\u2019re [growing] [ph] to pace relative to the loan growth expectations that you laid out?","Andy Cecere","Right. So, Erika, as we talked about in the last call, we did increase our securities portfolio from $80 billion to $85 billion in quarter one. My expectation is we will grow that to $90 billion in quarter two, so up somewhere similar amount another $5 billion. We\u2019re getting very close in terms of our target here, but we\u2019re \u2013 I\u2019m not going to give you a final number until we get a final role, because the final role has some uncertainty particularly as it relates to the offset on municipal deposits and that can draw our number one way or the other but we\u2019re getting very close but I would expect another $5 billion in quarter two.","As it relates to net interest margin, I would expect a decrease that you saw this quarter similar in the second quarter for some of the same reasons. So, that $5 billion increase in securities portfolio will probably drive margin down 3 to 4 basis points and the combination of loan fees and mix will be another couple of basis points. So, I would expect a similar decline in quarter two. However, because we\u2019re growing earning assets, I would expect net interest income to grow in quarter two.","Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America","And given sort of your comments, I know there is still the swing factor, is the liquidity built in the second half potentially slower than the pace for the first half for the year?","Andy Cecere","Again, Erika it will depend on the final role as we hope to get in the summer months, but I wouldn\u2019t expect it to accelerate certainly and it will somewhere around the same level or down. The other thing I would remind you, one of the things we talked about also is that CAA or Checking Account Advance product will start to impact margin because that fee goes to loan fees which is a component of margin, that will start to diminish over the second quarter and then more materially in quarters three and four.","Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America","Got it. And my second question Richard if I could just ask another one on commercial real estate in particular. We\u2019ve had comments from a large mega-cap bank, some large institutions during the quarter that commercial real estate continues to be a potential bright spot and that the competition is less fervent here than it is for C&I. On Monday, we heard from another regional bank essentially saying that they\u2019re starting to see frothiness in commercial real estate. Perhaps, give us a little bit of your view on this.","Bill Parker","Yes, sure. I don\u2019t have any remarkable offers, I would necessarily align with Monday\u2019s commentary. We\u2019ve always been growing commercial real estate, I think this past we\u2019ve done in a very prudent way. We were the ones I think alerting people eight quarters ago about certain markets that we\u2019re getting sloppy as it related to multifamily as you start to intersect that with what would be for our closed property we\u2019re coming back on to the market. So, we\u2019ve been very, very careful not to jump into hard markets that when you predict where there will be once everything is built probably too overbuilt. So, we\u2019ve been careful there. I wouldn\u2019t say that we were less competitive, I would say all of our wholesale businesses are competitive.","I would certainly think margin competition and as I said every quarter and I will continue to say because of our cost of funds advantage in our rating and if this will continue to compete on price and we can maybe one of those culprits for why it\u2019s more competitive on the margins but we will not give it out if it\u2019s a great customer. We will also not go for the customer if there is a structural need to diminish what would be a quality underwriting or something like that. So, I guess I would say I don\u2019t see anything remarkable about CRA as it relates to other C&I business Erika, but they\u2019re both competitive and more prepared to compete for them.","Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America","Got it. And just a last question and maybe this is for Andy. Was there anything unusual to call out on the mortgage banking line, there is a modest quarter-over-quarter increase in given typical seasonality. I think the market would have expected that to be down sequentially. Was there anything to call out there?","Andy Cecere","Erika, we thought mortgage revenue was going to be relatively flat to the fourth quarter and that\u2019s what it ended up being. We had a little bit of a benefit on the servicing rights effective evaluation but that has to be with earnings credit rates and so forth. So, I would say no, nothing remarkable and as I look into the second quarter I would expect a slight increase in mortgage revenue principally due to seasonality.","Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America","Great. Thank you, for taking my questions.","Richard Davis","Sure. Thanks Erika.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jill Glaser of Credit Suisse.","Richard Davis","Hi, Jill.","Andy Cecere","Hi, Jill.","Jill Glaser \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, good morning. So, could you just provide some color in terms of what you\u2019re seeing in securities of reinvestment yields and [indiscernible] and just your outlook in terms of the margin going forward. And then just overall with your ability to grow [indiscernible] income going forward?","Andy Cecere","Right. So, Jill, the \u2013 we\u2019re going to grow securities portfolios I mentioned about $5 billion on a net basis in quarter two. The securities coming on are about 25 to 30 basis points below those that are coming off in a quarter and then we have the $5 billion of growth. So, that combination of growth and the shift in the price are the rate cost us 3 to 4 basis points and that\u2019s the decline we\u2019ll see in the second quarter. That, and then as I mentioned the loan mix coupled with the loan fee is partly due to CA will be another couple of basis points. So, I would expect this to be down 5 or 6 basis points in the second quarter. However, as I mentioned, net interest income should growth because of earning asset growth.","Jill Glaser \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, great. Thanks.","Andy Cecere","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR.","Paul Miller \u2013 FBR","Yes. Thank you, very much. You mentioned on the first question of follow-up, the cities that are the most compelling than that are growing the most, I missed them all, you\u2019re telling too, that was Seattle, Orange County?","Richard Davis","Yes, I wouldn\u2019t say it once. I apologize. I said Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Orange County. So, I would write down the specific cost line there.","Paul Miller \u2013 FBR","And so, can you add some color what you\u2019re saying in Texas and in the Midwest?","Richard Davis","Yes. So, Texas is also the other market that I mentioned. These are markets where you got just underlying growth of populations and consumers, right. So, in Texas, you\u2019re going to find some of the traditional markets building out where the communities are getting large rooms were all continues and Texas has been healthy as you know virtually to the south period in time. The west coast primarily provides for what would be some of the transition to multi-family where we feel that as a safe markets based on the composition of growing and also just continued growth of \u2013 and migration in some of those growth markets where we see that personal and corporate needs for real estate continue to be pretty strong. We haven\u2019t spent a lot of time and energy talking about healthcare and some of the retail lease services because we\u2019re very careful on that area as well because I want to make sure that they\u2019re finding themselves in the right cities and we\u2019re not messing around in that market right now but we are looking in where development follows people.","Paul Miller \u2013 FBR","And then, on the \u2013 you did a good job CRA in the competitive nature out there but one of the areas that you\u2019ve really been growing is the credit card and a lot of people showed lower credit card balances in the first quarter but you continue to show good growth in that. Can you add color around that, is that a big push for you guys?","Richard Davis","Yes, it is. It is \u2013 it\u2019s a big part of our portfolio, it\u2019s like 7.5% which is one of the reasons why our charge-offs are always [indiscernible] number higher than most of our peers, I don\u2019t think anyone has the portfolio risen important as we do it to our mix and we like it. So, we\u2019re going to continue to grow that. I think you know that we have a FlexPerks program which is \u2013 it was derivative of when we lost the Northwest Airlines of airlines sold them in it. The most remarkable thing I\u2019ll have ever been a part of my career when I\u2019m done here, it continues to provide all kinds of new interest and we continue to get awards for it to get lot of visibility without having to spend lot of time on TV commercials and direct that branding. That brings the branch originations, with 3100 branches we really had not turned out the opportunity for that to be a significant source of really good high quality new cards. So, we have done that in the last six quarters and that\u2019s been a remarkable contributor to the kind of growth we\u2019ve had.","And then lastly, Paul to remind you, even in our FlexPerk which I\u2019d mentioned a moment ago, we\u2019ve now introduced a corporate program a FlexPerk Rewards program for corporate cards which continue now to gaining a lot of favor as we realize that lot of these corporate and small business folks are interested in finding a way to retrieve some sort of benefit from using a card and that\u2019s taken amazing success in the early stages. So, I think there is more where that came from as well. But to say, that we\u2019re spending time and energy on credit card is an understatement for me to go back and repeat as part of our R&D cost have been protected under the area of cards not present which will be mobile banking and mobile payments, we\u2019re seeing a lot of energy there too. So, I would expect that to exceed most of our peers going forward in the area we\u2019re spending doing lot of money to make sure we stay ahead of the game.","Paul Miller \u2013 FBR","And then one last on the order side, it\u2019s actually an area that you are really done a nice job growing. How is the competitive nature there? How are you\u2019ve been because everybody is focused on that but I think you\u2019ve done the best job out there than anybody.","Richard Davis","Thank you. The indirect auto business for us has always been a core capability but as you recall we\u2019ve announced our [indiscernible] impact over a couple of years. We decided that we will go further down in the [indiscernible] so to the \u2013 we call them near prime. But we also realized that we weren\u2019t a big player in used auto. So, I\u2019ll just take you through an example, if you Paul or the F&I guy had the largest Shelby dealer in whatever city, you\u2019ve always knowing that we were one of the best paper then pick for auto loans and leases for new cars.","And now we\u2019ve introduced used cars, you feel better about introducing the U.S. Bank\u2019s by paper across spectrum. And then the bonus round as you get more floor planning from that same institution because you\u2019re now wholly committed to them in a number of ways that perhaps you weren\u2019t before. So, for us it\u2019s kind of a two for three folks but we\u2019re also getting a high visibility of those dealers planning interest in taking the rest of our paper. So, we already are taking an open door and pushing it further open. I will say that in the rankings we saw in fourth quarter, we\u2019d moved up 1.5% in share from eighth place to fifth place among banks. And so that does reflect that our early stage efforts just trying to show up and I would expect that to stay in the top five which is one of our stated goals as we really double the value of this business.","We\u2019re very careful, I didn\u2019t say subprime using clearly I just said something [indiscernible] below near prime but we\u2019re going to get a lot of that and used autos as well. So, I think that\u2019s the reason you\u2019re seeing a full line kind of a holistic success and I expect this to be one of our big replacement strategies for OB and new normal for mortgage in the next couple of years.","Paul Miller \u2013 FBR","Thank you, very much guys.","Richard Davis","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Murray of ISI.","Richard Davis","Hi, Keith.","Keith Murray \u2013 ISI","Thanks. Good morning. Can you just touch on the expense outlook and obviously near term be interested in that but for the longer term when you think about age of compliance that we\u2019re in and compliance cost going up. Over the long-term do you think your efficiency ratio where does it bottom in the 50s versus history?","Bill Parker","Yes. So, first of all Keith, I\u2019m glad you asked question if I would have found the way out do myself, so which I\u2019d be known to do. Keep yourselves, thank you. First of all in the near term, let\u2019s talk about I\u2019ll remind the audience how we\u2019ve managed the company. Every single 30 days, every 68 lines of business set with me and Andy and we look at their first performance related to their near term forecast and most of it or rest of whatever year we\u2019re under. So, we create a placer on your call looking around corners. And we thought ourselves on that and as we look around the corners, we continue to measure and manage what it starts out a proper plan continue the year and we adjust it all through the year.","And so, as we see any stress on revenue and it could be not so much on volume but it might on margins and on the total income then we\u2019re going to manage the same thing on expenses. So, we manage expenses 30 days at the time and we are watching every nickel and dime and it\u2019s not without surprise to you that we are very, very prudent right now and we\u2019re watching all discretionary costs, we\u2019re measuring it very closely, we\u2019re watching all new hires and we\u2019re being excessively prudent right now because until I see a sustain and a very robust revenue in future, we\u2019re going to be very careful and we\u2019re actually watching our expenses to a level below, we thought that would be when we set the plan six months ago.","So, hopefully that gives you all confidence and we\u2019re not to watch that. Secondly, the efficiency ratio, there is nothing more than the result of positive operating leverage and we promise you positive operating leverage this year and we\u2019re going to deliver it. Naively, but that\u2019s the whole part of watching the expenses but that they stay below the revenue growth that we\u2019re of course seeing and predicting. So, you will find as long as we keep to that mandate and our efficiency ratio stays in low 50s because that\u2019s how the math works. We don\u2019t have the goal for our efficiency ratio but because our goal is positive operating leverage and we\u2019re sitting at low 50s, you can grow that but not on the given quarter, but over the course of the year when it staying up to that position as well.","If you want to go longer term, Richard Davis here thinks is as rates start to increase as the economy starts to pick up, we become in fact essentially much more profitable and our expenses did not grow at that same speed as our revenue and our efficiency ratio will probably does fall, that it will only be result, there is no target, there is no goal. And I think what you see now is probably one of our least attractive moments in time and the cost of compliance for all intents and purposes, they\u2019re in full burdened and most of what you see now as we continue to look into the future with a new kind of normal for the cost of compliance and audit.","Keith Murray \u2013 ISI","Thank you.","Bill Parker","Not only excited but [indiscernible] up until.","Keith Murray \u2013 ISI","And just going back to LCR for a second. Does it at all change your view on commercial deposits and how you view them going forward?","Richard Davis","No, it does impact how we think about different deposits in the company and depending upon the LCR runoff assumption, certain deposits are certain more valuable, we try to reflect that in our pricing, we\u2019ve actually incorporated LCR into our FTP system our Funds Transfer Pricing system. And different deposits have different value and that is a function of LCR and we\u2019re taking that into account.","Keith Murray \u2013 ISI","Thanks. And then just last one, I know it\u2019s early stages but any update on reworking the deposit in banks product and what are the steps that you\u2019d have to go through on that?","Richard Davis","Yes, we\u2019re working on it. We\u2019re working strictly with our lead regulator the LCC and but we haven\u2019t done a solution yet and as much as we\u2019re all trying to figure out what\u2019s the next step to try. If you follow the real tight balance of the user we lost some 30 some percent of total APR no matter how you calculate it on any given one day, you probably can find a price out but this is going to be the old fashion terms. So, dependent on the willingness of the regulators to allow us to try different combination of new products and new repayment practices. I know they\u2019re working good pace with a number of us trying to find that solution, I\u2019ve made it for the U.S. Bank\u2019s [indiscernible] pilot and tries certain variations on a program to see what kind of loan loss we would have offset against some of the benefits.","I do think this industry needs a replacement for folks who would have some form of advanced need on financials before they get their paid but we haven\u2019t start building that yet and with number of us working with the regulators I think it\u2019s in the offering but it won\u2019t be here soon as our CAA products starts to wind down, so we\u2019ll have to do this again and when it does come back it will be at the same level of profitability but be much more of a CRA kind of a program that will be intended to test and find ways to serve more customers as this recovery starts to pick up.","Keith Murray \u2013 ISI","Thank you.","Richard Davis","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Andy Cecere","Hi, ken.","Bryan Batory - Jefferies","Hi, good morning guys. This is Bryan Batory for Ken Usdin.","Richard Davis","Hi, Brian.","Andy Cecere","Hi, Brian.","Bryan Batory - Jefferies","Okay. On the tax rate, it was a little bit lower in the previous guide last quarter. I\u2019m just wondering if there is anything unusual the ramp of the tax line this quarter. And where do you expect the tax rate to run going forward from here?","Andy Cecere","It was a little lower Brian, you\u2019re right and part of it is due to a small state settlement we had in the quarter, so the TV effective rate was 28.1%. However, I don\u2019t expect a large variation for the rest of the year and I would expect it to be somewhere around 28.5%, 28.7% for the full year. So, right around this range, little higher but not much.","Bryan Batory - Jefferies","Okay, great. And then deposits are continue to grow in year-over-year basis, but the growth was a little bit slower quarter-over-quarter, looking at the averages and period end balances particularly for non-interest bearing. Are we starting to see the very early signs here of customers growing deposit funds to fund working capital needs or CapEx or was there just a seasonality impact on deposits this quarter?","Andy Cecere","Brian, it was a more a seasonality impact. We typically have a lower first quarter both because of our corporate trust activities as well as wholesale activities in the first quarter. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s yet decline that their drawing down to deposits for investment, I think it\u2019s more seasonality and I would expect it to increase in the second quarter.","Bryan Batory - Jefferies","Okay. And one final question, the other fee income line was little bit higher than trend, I know you guys call out equity investment gains and some leasing items. Any sense for how big, the magnitude of these gains where?","Andy Cecere","If anything is greater than $20 million or $25 million, we usually call as reserve base so it was more a function of a number of smaller things and that can be lumpy in that category. But we\u2019re talking about that category when you bring upon item you may have read on Monday that Nuveen was part of the transaction with TIAA-CREF and we have an ownership interest in Nuveen. When it\u2019s offset and done, that will result in a positive in the fourth quarter for us. As it\u2019s typical on asset management transactions there are components of revenue retention the customer retention that will determine the final price, but as we sit today, I would expect that would create a gain of a few cents in the fourth quarter.","Richard Davis","Yeah, we\u2019ve always have vested our first American funds almost two years ago.","Andy Cecere","2010.","Richard Davis","Yes. And that went to the real estate with an equity position and now this transaction will positively impact us later in the year.","Bryan Batory - Jefferies","Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Richard Davis","Yes.","Andy Cecere","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scinicariello of UBS","Steve Scinicariello \u2013 UBS","Good morning, everyone.","Richard Davis","Hi, Steve.","Steve Scinicariello \u2013 UBS","Just a couple of quick questions on the fee income areas, just want to follow up on the commercial products revenue. I know you kind of mentioned you had some lower wholesale transaction activity just kind of curious has that kind of since rebounded or what the outlook be from here?","Andy Cecere","Right, Steve. So, it\u2019s a function of a couple of things, one standby letter of credit activity is down and that has been trending down for the past few quarters, I would expect it continue to be flat to down in the second quarter. Second, there is some syndication revenue in that line and that can be lumpy and the first quarter was particularly down, that may come back a little bit in the second quarter. But, generally speaking the commercial products revenue is a function of activity on the wholesale side, first quarter is typically low, it will come back a bit in the second quarter, but I still think showing components like standbys and other credits are going to continue to trend downward.","Steve Scinicariello \u2013 UBS","Got you. And then just I know there is seasonality in lot of the card lines, the deposit lines in some other areas, any reason why those wouldn\u2019t bounce back as well or is it just purely seasonal that\u2019s put down this quarter?","Andy Cecere","For sure, the payments component is weakest in the first quarter across most of the categories and I would expect that to continue to bounce in the second quarter. Deposit service charge is also lower in the first quarter, but a lot of that is also driven by incidents and activity on the retail side. So all things being equal, you would expect a bit of an increase in the second quarter, but it will depend on customer and retail activity.","Steve Scinicariello \u2013 UBS","Perfect. Thank you so much.","Andy Cecere","Sure.","Richard Davis","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran of Autonomous.","Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous","Hi, good morning. Can you, I guess if you separate your footprint into the cold weather bid, in the warm weather bid, was the trajectory month by month noticeably different into extent the cold weather, part of the footprint was weaker, by the end of March was a kind of back to normal level?","Richard Davis","We really didn\u2019t, it sounds so popular to say, but we really didn\u2019t see much, I mean even the Pacific Southwest where you have the more traditional winter and the lack of snow and things wasn\u2019t meaningfully different than Central and Midwest plans that we do banking and so, while there was undoubtedly some diminishment of consumer activity on those really bad snow events, but for ultimately that we\u2019re not counting on whether to be much of a factor and we certainly don\u2019t see a big pent-up catch up and kind of like a catch of the clock, because we don\u2019t see that coming through.","Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous","And then on the payments business, you had a couple of comments that seems more positive. We\u2019ve been through a kind of transition period first with the regulatory changes and with the Department of Defense. I mean, we are at a point now where we hit that turning point and certainly the comps are easier but the growth rate kind of returns back to normal or there are still kind of identifiable headwinds that you see in the near term that would depress results across those four line items?","Andy Cecere","Well, Brian, we are seeing the decrease in defense and government spending go down. So, while we\u2019re still down year-over-year, it was down a far lesser amount, it was down may be 5% or 6% and it was offset by increased corporate activity which actually resulted in corporate payment systems revenue being up on a year-over-year basis, which is a positive sign. So, I think we\u2019ve seen the worst of it. I think it will start to stabilize and grow.","Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous","If I could sneak in one last one on the dividend targets long term, you\u2019ve always been very consistent about this, but if you could just remind us, both from your standpoint and a regulatory standpoint, what would have to happen for the environment to look like a 40% dividend payout instead of the 31%.","Richard Davis","Yes, this is Richard. We have always kind of reset it some mid-90, 30% to 40% will be a dividend of 30% to 40% in buybacks and we\u2019re relying more on the buyback at this stage. Two things, Brian, one is we have been without the Fed oversight, we\u2019re going to be very prudent and careful to make sure the revenue we do is sustainable under renewed circumstance trust or not. And so a 30% on the lower end of that 30 to 40 per dividend and I believe that in the next year or few years, we will either get permission real comfortable permission we\u2019d have we want in that range but we\u2019ll start to think such a robustly strong 24 month future that will move over that number, because we like to give about 30 but we wouldn\u2019t get above 40. So it\u2019s going to be that slow trip somewhere in the middle. Buybacks in the meantime are a very elegant solutions to allow us to have that kind of permissions as long as the price is right and the financials are right to allow our shareholders to target a good return, we\u2019re giving us that ability turn out and off something given the uncertainty until we see things being more I think sustained.","So, we\u2019re not disappointed where we are, all things told we would get there in a nice long methodical way anyway and I think our expectations were probably aligned pretty well with what the Federal permitted to do as we continue to prove ourselves and prove our stress that it to be accurate and other five years in a row. So we\u2019ll get there over time, but we\u2019re not doing a withheld and we don\u2019t really want to send a signal that we are disappointed.","Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous","Appreciate it. Thank you.","Richard Davis","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio of KBW.","Chris Mutascio \u2013 KBW","Good morning Richard, how are you?","Richard Davis","Great. How are you?","Chris Mutascio \u2013 KBW","I\u2019m doing well. Thanks. Andy, just a quick question, back on the mortgage side of the house and I\u2019m looking at page 40 and kind of give nice breakdown between the origination loan servicing and some of the inputs on the servicing asset. The one item I was kind of looking at is the decay, you know the other changes and mortgage service and rights fair value, you know that\u2019s been running plus or minus a $100 million, excuse me growing a negative plus or minus $100 million for the last several quarters and this quarter was down into the $80 million range. I\u2019m assuming that decay is less than previous quarters, because prepayments speeds have slowed, is that first of all is that correct?","Andy Cecere","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Chris Mutascio \u2013 KBW","And then is that, I guess hard to predict clearly, but if the rates were to stay where they are and it\u2019s up on long term side, how would I look at the decay would it stabilize at a negative $80 million or does it get lower from here?","Andy Cecere","It all depends on rates as you just mentioned, because of prepayments but I would expect to reach stable to maybe up a little bit depending upon rates within this level.","Chris Mutascio \u2013 KBW","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Andy Cecere","You bet.","Richard Davis","Thanks Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson.","Richard Davis","Hey, Eric.","Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust","Hi, good morning. Just to follow up on a two different issues that had been raised on the call already. The decline in the credit and debit cards revenue that you showed sequentially is a bit more than what some of your peers have demonstrated and I would have guessed that weather effects may have been part of that, but it seems like maybe weather wasn\u2019t such a driver. So I\u2019m just curious about what in your view might have explained that differential versus peers.","Andy Cecere","I can\u2019t speak to the peers, but our number on a sequential basis is entirely seasonality if you think about our credit card, retail credit card revenue if you look at a year-over-year we are up over 11% principally driven by increased activity and increased market share gain. So the linked quarter is all seasonality.","Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust","Got it. And then just to go back to Keith\u2019s question on the payday events for a moment, I believe that you previously guided to us a quarterly impact of around $50 million negative in NII, is that the case and was that evidenced in this period?","Andy Cecere","We did have decline across the, as expected I would say so across all other fee categories I would say it was yes it was as expected. So, on the payday lending or at the CAA product the full year numbers about $220 million, the first quarter was a little impact. The second quarter is going to be down about $15 million then it goes almost entirely way in quarters three and four.","Richard Davis","That goes about line at the end of May, so we just be at small slow trip down to zero as the year end.","Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust","Got it. So, sorry Andy just because I was making quickness so that was very little first quarter of 15, second and then sort of failed out by third.","Andy Cecere","Right. So, you think about it\u2019s just a huge number, if you think about $200 million it\u2019s sort of 503500.","Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust","Got it. Great. Thanks so much.","Andy Cecere","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo.","Andy Cecere","Good morning Matt.","Richard Davis","Hi, Matt.","Jason Harbes \u2013 Wells Fargo","Hey, good morning guys it\u2019s actually Jason Harbes on Matt. So it looks like you got a pretty nice blues from equity investments and retail leasing revenue and the other fee income category this quarter. Just curious how sustainable do you view that and we guys still expecting overall fee income growth in 2014 in spite of the weaker contribution for mortgage?","Andy Cecere","So Jason a couple of things in that other category, there are miscellaneous equity gains that occur that can be lumpy quarter to quarter. So sometimes up, sometimes down, this was a little bit of a positive quarter as we benefit a little bit from those investments. You really don\u2019t know what the next quarters will be until we get the results from the events which we have, so it\u2019s hard to tell exactly, but I wouldn\u2019t expect material changes neither up nor down other than the gain I talked about that we expect in the fourth quarter from the Nuveen transaction, so that\u2019s number one.","Number two, in terms of overall fee revenue, we\u2019re going to continue to have the headwind on a year-over-year basis in mortgage banking in quarter two because the decline in mortgage banking didn\u2019t really start last year into quarters three and four. But I would expect fee growth in many of the other categories and I would expect overall fee growth in quarters three and four once we\u2019re passed that mortgage headwind.","Jason Harbes \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay, thanks. And just I guess my follow-up would be on the impact of the affordable housing accounting rule change. Specifically, how we should be thinking about the non-controlling interest line, it looks like that\u2019s a little bit of a different number than we\u2019ve seen historically.","Andy Cecere","Yes. And that was a function of change we made in the fourth quarter, I would say the first quarter is back to a normal level across all categories and the first quarter impact versus the fourth quarter was about $35 million lower non-interest expense and $35 million higher taxes, but that\u2019s now in the run rate and what you see in the first quarter now reflects all the accounting change than what we would expect to see in future quarter. So, the only change you\u2019ll see for us is really volume related, no more accounting.","Jason Harbes \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. Thanks guys.","Andy Cecere","Sure.","Richard Davis","Thanks Jason.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Dan Werner of Morningstar.","Dan Werner \u2013 Morningstar","Good morning.","Andy Cecere","Hi Dan.","Dan Werner \u2013 Morningstar","Hi. If I\u2019d asked you guys year and a half, two years ago what a normalize net charge-off level was, you would have said around 1% and clearly since then, as the quality has improved and charge-off levels have come down, if I ask you that question now what would you consider normalize charge-off levels both near term and longer term, what kind of answer would I get?","Richard Davis","Long-term and let Bill answer but long term is still 1%. Under the mix of the portfolio, it\u2019s hard to remember the old division of day\u2019s right. But if we\u2019re all extending credit at the right level and we are taking the appropriate measured risk, especially with the credit card portfolio which has the level ours is and the kind of business that we will plan to conduct in consumer areas, 1% would be over the long-term. We actually never had 1%, you got since one way or the other. And based on the map of credit measurements and credit quality we could take a number of years to get to the one. And so we are not taking risk today to get there sooner than we should but we are also not trying to diminish what value we get from housing at 59 basis point but Bill [indiscernible].","Bill Parker","Yes. So, Dan we will measure that every quarter and I mean it\u2019s very plus or minus the couple basis point of that 1%. So, that just goes to the consistency of our outlook for the portfolio and how we underwrite. And as Richard said, the 1% is not a target per se.","Dan Werner \u2013 Morningstar","Right.","Bill Parker","It is a true, the cycle number. So in good times it\u2019s going to be significantly less and then in bad times it\u2019s going to be higher.","Bill Parker","Okay.","Richard Davis","And we do not going to see it for a while and even with our recovery that has been taken out, charge-offs are very, very moderate at this point and very flattish. So, at this undoubtedly, we \u2013 you know we kind of want all the banks to start going that movement northward as the credit quality becomes important and so does the volume in the more robust nature, people seeking credit in some cases not finding way to pay it back but I don\u2019t think it is just for a while.","Dan Werner \u2013 Morningstar","Okay. Thank you.","Richard Davis","Thanks.","Operator","That was our final question. I would not like to turn the conference back over to Sean O\u2019Connor for any closing remarks.","Sean O\u2019Connor","Thank you all for listening today\u2019s call.

Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Cecere, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon EDT through Wednesday, October 29, at 12:00 midnight EDT. I will now turn the conference call over to Sean O'Connor, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.","Sean O'Connor","Thank you, Tiffany, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's third quarter 2014 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.","I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Richard.","Richard K. Davis","Thanks, Sean. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I'll begin with a review of U.S. Bank's results, with a summary of the quarter's highlights on Page 3 of the presentation.","U.S. Bank reported net income of $1.5 billion for the third quarter of 2014 or $0.78 per diluted common share. Total average loans grew 6.3% year-over-year and 1.4% linked quarter. Excluding the impact from the Charter One acquisition we completed in late June, total average loans grew 5.9% year-over-year and 1.1% on a linked quarter basis. In addition, we experienced strong loan -- strong growth in average deposits, and credit quality remains strong.","Total net charge-offs decreased by 3.7% on a linked quarter basis. Nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, declined on both the linked quarter and a year-over-year basis. It generates significant capital this quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated for the Basel III standardized approach has been fully implemented. It was 9% at September 30th. We repurchased 16 million shares of common stock during the third quarter, which along with our dividend, resulted in a 78% return of earnings to our shareholders in the third quarter.","Slide 4 provides you with a 5-quarter history of our performance metrics, and they continue to be among the best in the industry. Return on average assets in the third quarter was 1.51%, and return on average common equity was 14.5%. Moving over to the graph on the right. You can see that this quarter's net interest margin was 3.16%, in line with our guidance. Our efficiency ratio for the third quarter was 52.4%. We expect this ratio to remain in the low 50s, going forward, as we continue to manage expenses in relation to revenue trends, while continuing to invest in and grow our businesses.","Turning to Slide 5. The company reported total net revenue in the third quarter of $5 billion, a 2% increase from the prior year. The increase was due to higher net interest income, as well as higher revenue in most fee businesses, partially offset by a reduction in mortgage banking revenue.","Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 6. Average total loans outstanding increased by almost $15 billion or 6.3% year-over-year and 1.4% linked quarter. Adjusting for the Charter One acquisition, total average loans grew 5.9% year-over-year and 1.1% linked quarter. Overall, excluding covered loans, which is a runoff portfolio, average total loans grew by 7.7% year-over-year and 1.7% linked quarter.","Again this quarter, the increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans, which grew by 13.6% year-over-year and 3.1% over the prior quarter. Total average commercial real estate also increased over the prior quarters, with an average loans growing by 6.1% year-over-year and 0.8% linked quarter. Residential real estate loans grew 5.8% year-over-year and 0.3% over the prior quarter. Average credit card loans increased 4.9% year-over-year and were up 2.1% on a linked-quarter basis. Total other retail loans grew 3.6% year-over-year and 1.6% over the prior quarter, mainly driven by steady growth in auto loans.","Total average revolving commercial and commercial real estate commitments continue to grow at a fast pace, increasing year-over-year by 12.9% and 3.2% on a linked-quarter basis. Line utilization was relatively flat again in the third quarter. Total average deposits increased almost $19 billion or 7.4% over the same quarter of last year and 3.3% over the previous quarter. Excluding the Charter One acquisition, the growth rate remains strong at 5.5% on a year-over-year basis and 1.7% on a linked-quarter basis. Growth in low-cost savings deposits is particularly strong on both a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis.","Turning to Slide 7 in credit quality. Total net charge-offs declined 3.7% on a linked-quarter basis and rose modestly on a year-over-year basis due to an unusually high recovery in third quarter of 2013. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 0.55% in the third quarter. Nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, decreased by 6.2% from the third quarter of 2013 and were essentially flat on a linked-quarter basis.","During the third quarter, we released $25 million of reserves, equal to the reserve released in the prior quarter and $5 million less than in the third quarter of 2013. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect net charge-offs to remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter of 2014.","Andy will now give you a few more details about our third quarter results.","Andrew Cecere","Thanks, Richard. Slide 8 gives you see a view of our third quarter 2014 results versus comparable time periods.","Our diluted EPS of $0.78 was 2.6% higher than the third quarter of 2013 and equal to the prior quarter. The key drivers of the company's third quarter earnings are summarized on Slide 9.","The $3 million or 0.2% increase in net income year-over-year was principally due to an increase in total net revenue, driven by increases in both net interest income and fee-based revenue. The company also achieved positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis.","Net interest income was up 1.3% year-over-year, as an increase in average earning assets was partially offset by a lower net interest margin, including lower loan fees. The $31.4 billion increase in average earning assets year-over-year included growth in average total loans, as well as planned increases in the securities portfolio. Offsetting a portion of the growth in these categories was a $1.4 billion reduction in average loans held for sale, reflecting lower mortgage origination activity versus the same quarter of last year.","The net interest margin of 3.16% was 27 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2013, primarily due to growth in the investment portfolio at lower average rates, lower loan fees and lower rates and new loans, partially offset by lower funding costs. Lower loan fees were due to previously communicated wind down of Checking Account Advance, our short-term, small-dollar deposit advanced product.","Noninterest income increased $65 million or 3% year-over-year due to higher revenue in most fee businesses, partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue. We saw growth in retail and corporate payments, merchant processing, trust and investment management fees, deposit service charges and treasury management fees, commercial products revenue and investment product fees. Noninterest income increased year-over-year by $49 million or 1.9%, primarily due to an increase in compensation expense, reflecting the impact of merit increases, acquisitions and higher staffing for risk and compliance activities.","Net income was lower on a linked-quarter basis by $24 million or 1.6%, mainly due to the increase of noninterest expense, partially offset by a decrease in the provision for credit losses. The second quarter of 2014 included 2 previously disclosed notable items impacting non -- other noninterest income and other noninterest expense, that together had no impact to diluted earnings per common share.","On a linked-quarter basis, net interest income increased 0.1% due to an increase in average earning assets, mostly offset by a lower net interest margin, including lower loan fees. Net interest margin of 3.16% was, as expected, 11 basis points lower than the second quarter. Principally, due to the growth of lower rate investment securities and lower loan fees due to the Checking Account Advance product wind down. On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income was lower by $202 million or 8.3%, primarily due to the second quarter Visa stock sale, lower mortgage banking revenue and lower commercial products revenue, partially offset by higher deposit service charges, corporate payments products' revenue and trust and investment management revenue.","On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense decreased by $139 million or 5% due to the second quarter FHA DOJ settlement in Other expense, partially offset by Charter One merger integration costs and higher mortgage servicing-related costs.","Turning to Slide 10, our capital position is strong. Beginning January 1, 2014, the regulatory capital requirement effective for the company followed Basel III, subject to certain transition provisions from Basel I over the next 4 years, to full implementation by January 1, 2018. In addition, beginning with the second quarter of 2014, the advanced approaches portion of Basel III became effective for the company. A common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated, using in the Basel III standardized approach as is fully implemented at September 30, was 9%. At 9%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to $15.66 at September 30, representing a 13.3% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 2.6% increase over the prior quarter.","I'll now turn the call back to Richard.","Richard K. Davis","Thanks, Andy. To conclude our formal remarks, I'll turn your attention to Slide 11.","We remain focused on extending our advantage, which is our theme for 2014. Our consistently solid financial performance is a result of our adhering closely to the core fundamentals of controlling expenses, of managing capital prudently, and selectively investing in initiatives that generates steady, long-term growth, and expanding existing customer relationships. That was certainly the case in third quarter, as our disciplined approach produced positive operating leverage.","As we head into the final quarter of the year, we remain diligently focused on executing our plan, even with the ongoing economic headwinds, with an emphasis on providing our customers with the trusted products and services to help them build more secure financial futures, backed by the financial strength of U.S. Bank.","That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer any questions from the audience.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR Capital Markets.","Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","This is Jessica Ribner in for Paul Miller. We just have one question. It's just taking into account the recent changes announced by the FHFA in terms of the 3% down payment and some reps and warrants clarity, does that change the way that you think about originating down the credit spectrum in the mortgage space? Or how do you guys view that?","Richard K. Davis","It really doesn't. This is Richard. It's a good sound bite, but I think the test comes in whether or not there's a private market for investors to pick up these loans with lower or no down payment, and I'm not sure there will be. So we're going to continue to stick with the FHFA, Freddie and Fannie deals that we originate, that we sell off. We'll continue to originate loans that we hold on the balance sheet for our more well-heeled customers. And we'll continue to watch the progress in this space, because we like very much to feel more comfortable making loans with, I'd say, either a lower FICO or with less down payment. But unless we're convinced that the rules are going to be permanent and there's not going to be a look back or a reach back in future times, or that there won't be a market for this, we're simply going to stay on the sidelines in the concerns of both compliance risks and other uncertainties, and we'll just continue to do what we're doing now, which I think is sufficient for the near term.","Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And what do you -- just a follow-up to that. What do you think would -- what do you think that they would have to say or come out with to make you more comfortable in that space? Because you were talking about a reach back or something like that.","Richard K. Davis","Right, right. No, that's a great question, Jessica, and I'm not sure I have the answer to that because I'd have to see it, believe it, and then test it. And so it's going to take a while for me to have a belief that this litigation risk isn't as great as compliance risk, which used to be both less important than credit risk. So when you think about all the risks we have, credit risk, we can manage. We've done that through the whole cycle, and we did it well before. In terms of litigation risk, that's kind of the new uncertainty. And with the statute, I think, of time coming up on us, there may be a softening of some of those look back, reach back. But in where I started, there's a private market out there that's got to say they want to buy these loans without the guarantees and they've got to be willing to take those loans on with those lesser quality customers under the risk that perhaps they won't repay. And that's going to be a market that's going to be tested over time, with the number of players that will have a chance to come in. And once we see that appetite, that will probably be the first evidence we'll be looking for.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just wondering about the outlook for the net interest margin next quarter. Andy, could you give us some other puts and takes for the margin and what kind of outlook you have for net interest margin and net interest income growth?","Andrew Cecere","Sure, John. So if you think about the third quarter versus second, we were down 11 basis points, and that was 3 things. One -- the first is 5 basis points for CAA, and that's done. So that won't repeat in the fourth quarter. The second was about 3 basis points for the securities build, and that will continue on in the fourth quarter. We ended this quarter at about $96.5 billion. We'll end the fourth quarter just over $100 billion. So we'll have additional migration down, because of that 3 to 4 basis points. The third factor was the loan mix. Most of our growth was in wholesale, as opposed to retail, and that was 2 to 3 basis points of pressure. That will continue likely into the fourth quarter also. So all in, down 5 to 7 for the fourth quarter, but I still expect net interest income to grow. And then finally, that pressure on securities build will diminish, will go away beginning in 2015.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. You'll be done, you think, by the first quarter?","Andrew Cecere","We'll -- our expectation is that we'll end this year at or above 100% on the LCR ratio. So our net securities growth will be more consistent with the overall balance sheet growth, as opposed to building additional to meet the LCR ratio.","Richard K. Davis","So John, NIM compression. All that remains for '15 is loan mix and interest rates, in general. But we've really gotten rid of the other variables that have been moving all through this year, taking the number down.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And Richard, could you give us some color on your feelings about loan growth from here, both just kind of the absolute level of growth you're looking for and then the mix factors?","Richard K. Davis","I'm feeling pretty good, actually. So let me just -- I should say this to all of you. First, I'm glad to see that you're even on the call. I thought being last, we might not have anybody come to our party. We always announce our earnings...","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Reporting with 10 other banks this time?","Richard K. Davis","Well, I'll tell you what. Who cares about what we have the say now, right? We have always announced earnings on the Wednesday after our Board meeting, and the Board meeting has always been the third Tuesday. For the first time in my years as CEO, my 8 years as a CEO, the -- that created [ph] the fourth Wednesday. And so that's why we're still late in the cycle, I'm talking to all of you a week later. We've amended that with the Board, and we're going to go back to announcing on the third Wednesday. So this will be the last time we have this trailer keeping you from writing your final reports. And so I just want to make that clear. By the same token, though, I have this great visibility and clarity I've never had before and what the other banks have been saying. And so, I'm going to say, we're generally positive about loan growth, and I'm saying that for the following reasons. As Andy indicated, we had the 1.4% linked quarter growth. If you take out the Capital One acquisition, it's 1.1%, and that's right in the range of what we telegraphed. And we're going to telegraph that again for quarter 4. We think we're in that same place, as we are still moving into the early stages of the fourth quarter. We're seeing it across the board, too, John. So, I mean, we're seeing in Wholesale Banking. We're seeing people continue to support capital expenditures, particularly in large ticket leasing and in corporate banking. We're seeing the pipeline across all energy -- industries stronger as the year ages, which is pretty positive. We're also seeing the leverage portion of the market remains pretty fast-growing, but we don't participate much in that and there's a regulatory oversight that's more heavy at this point in time, and so it doesn't affect us near as much. And then a strong market, bond market is still strong. So that does take some of the loan volume away. But overall, we don't see anything less than we've seen in the last couple of quarters. Commercial real estate, still pretty strong. If you look at the West, East Coast and you take kind of the smile down to Texas and you move around, we see it's pretty active across most property-buying areas. We're seeing some investors getting into the central part of the country, Minneapolis, Denver and Phoenix, places like that. Property types are looking good. Apartments, retail, offices, lodging properties, and we're seeing people get lines of credit and using their lines for property acquisitions. And then we're seeing also nice strength in home equity. For the first time, we're actually putting more on the books than are running off, now that we're in that part of the cycle. Auto loans continue to be a strong point for us, and credit cards are growing nicely and are expected to, as you might expect, in the fourth quarter, seasonally get even stronger. So I mean, 1 to 1.5 and probably right around this 1 to 1.2 that we've been at isn't robust, but it's pretty solid. And what we're seeing is nice consistency, and our pipelines would reflect not only what we're hearing anecdotally, but the real facts that we've got some loan growth still well into our future. Having low interest rates isn't great for income, but it's pretty good for lending, and people continue to see that benefit. And we have that cost of funding advantage we've told you about, allow us to lend to the highest quality customers at a preferred price, and we're going to keep doing it.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And a little bit more led by the commercial, which is the loan mix impact on the NIM.","Richard K. Davis","Yes, I think it's very much the same. What you'll seen in the last few quarter will be very much the same, dominated by C&I, but started -- consumers starting to vie for its position now. Quarter 4 will be strong consumer with credit card, but will still be heavily mixed toward C&I, which will still put some pressure on NIM. But as we talked, it starts to wane later into the process.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. One quickie on the noninterest income. The credit and debit card revenues were a little lighter than expected. You mentioned rewards costs in the write-up. Is that kind of the new cost of business in a reward-centric world here? Is it -- any kind of onetime catch-up in there?","Andrew Cecere","This is Andy, John. So 2 things. One is just a number of processing days this year -- this quarter of 2014 versus the third quarter of 2013 caused a couple of percentage points decline. It was 90 days versus 94. So that's just the nuance with the number of business days. And the second thing was the rewards, which is a little bit elevated, but I would expect it to be at this level or slightly downward in the future quarters. But if you think about it, cards, on a core basis x the processing days, was up closer to 5% to 6%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David George of Baird.","David A. George - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Richard, I wanted to dovetail to John's question. It's more a big picture, but it's a very popular macro topic, and that's rates. Wanted to get not so much your views on rates, but more from the perspective of how you're thinking about running the company, allocating capital, making incremental investment, et cetera. Do you run the company any differently if rates stay here longer than people think? And any kind of industry implications that you think that emanate from that, to the extent that macro backdrop persists.","Richard K. Davis","Yes, David, that's a great question, and we're still evaluating our final view on what the rates will be, because just a couple of weeks ago, it might well have been a different scenario, right, based on what the prevailing view was, that rates will start moving up in the middle of the year, and now, people are thinking later next year. Here's how we've been running it this year. So it was February 15. I remember the exact date. Exactly the center of quarter 1. And remember, it was a very tough winter quarter for every business. And we decided to adjust our plan, all of 45 days into the year, and we placed a hold on FTE in the company. Let me repeat this, as I told you about this last time, too, that it's -- it's a response to your question. By placing hold on FTE, we didn't put in a hiring freeze. So if you have 881 people in your division, you can have 881 people. And in fact, I'm going to encourage you, now more than ever, to make sure that the 881 best people you could possibly have, because there's no limit on the quality of the people in the organization. But you can't go to 895 and you can't get to 906, until we see a revenue environment that's a little bit stronger. And so but for our compliance and compliance-related activities, where we didn't put any kind of a hold, based on what we think is appropriate regulatory focus, we've been doing that with quite good success. You might imagine one of my challenge is to have the employees of this company feel proud that because they're working harder, is why we're doing well, as opposed to make them wonder why we're doing so well and why am I working so hard. And we were trying to get that conversation organized properly, but I wouldn't hesitate to ask the employees to continue to do that onto the next year, if that's what the environment's going to state, because we really do want to give you guys positive operating leverage to our shareholders on an annual basis, I've always said, not in any 1 given quarter. And the way to do that is to decide what your revenue guardrails will be and then to stay within those, based on your expenses. And with the cost of healthcare and the cost of merit increases, what's left is to make sure you've got enough to not overspend, before you have the revenue. So we won't do more of what we did this year, the longer rates stay low or flat next year. By the same token, the minute we believe they're on their way up, we'll start to release some of those levels of limits and start moving forward more quickly. Let me also clarify, before I hear it my own way, that we're not slowing down on our investments, or our capital expenditures, or some of the longer-term necessary things you need to do to be ready for our future. So we're putting all that into that long-term view of what's most important and prioritizing, so we're still spending money. And as you know, our expenses are still growing, just at a level less than our revenue, and that's how we'll continue to do it. But I will agree that the minute rates start moving up and we see evidence, it gets a lot easier to run a company this long into a recession and a downturn.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question is, Richard, you have always taken advantage of increasing your market share when your peers are challenged. And based on Governor Tarullo's speech, it sounds like some of your larger peers may have to contend with higher buffers on common equity Tier 1. I guess I'm wondering, if that does transpire and you have some of your larger peers operating it 11.5, 12, 12.5, does that -- do you think that presents a further opportunity for U.S. Bank, being that you would be under that G-SIB requirement?","Richard K. Davis","I'll tell you, Erika, I think it's just a continuation of the benefits we've experienced, because first of all, you know that even if that occurs, it doesn't have to be overnight. And not unlike us, but most things, as we continue to get healthier, are creating capital. So I don't think that's a real burden for them into getting there. And I don't think it's any different than it's been for the last of couple of years, as we've been a SIFI and they've have been G-SIFIs. But I do think at the end of the day, our ability to be more profitable, be more attractive to shareholders and have a simpler, easier company to understand and invest in, I think that continues to become more and more obvious, and that's why we think we're in a particularly good position, where we are, as the first non-G-SIB, and I think there are advantages, many of which are continuing and some which might get a little stronger. But I don't think that very event changed any near-term outcome, and it just continues to remind us how fortunate we are.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And just a follow-up question to that. As we think about long-term capital return prospects for the company, which ratio should we think of as your binding constraint, the standardized CET1 or advanced?","Andrew Cecere","Standardized, Erika. So our advanced ratio's 200-plus basis points above our advanced, so our standardized will be our binding constraint and our target is 8%.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So a couple of questions. One, a follow on to that. On the funding side, is there an opportunity here, with the rate environment, to maybe reset, reduce some of the longer-term funding cost that you've got?","Andrew Cecere","Yes, Betsy. So when I gave you my expectation for rates into the fourth quarter and stability into next year, it reflects the fact that we have some long-term debt coming due, and that will be refunding or repricing it at a lower rate.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And you could even take advantage to do more than just what's coming due, or no?","Andrew Cecere","I think our focus will be on what is maturing, which is planned over the next 12 months.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then separately, in the payment space, obviously, you've got a great position, with effectively a closed loop or pretty close to a closed loop. Could you give us an update on how you're thinking about your own digital wallet, as well as broadening out use of tokenization for security-related purposes beyond just payments?","Richard K. Davis","Yes. Well, those are different questions. Digital wallet, I think you know we continue to invest in, virtually, every scheme we can find and each partner that we have, many of which we don't announce. It's not our plan to announce things until onset. But I'll just remind you that we are both a leader in mobile banking, but even more so, in mobile payments, because as you said, we have a closed loop capability. We've got all sides of the equation, and we're leveraging that. I might also say that -- it wouldn't surprise you, but we do a lot with customers. We have certain customer groups that we've put together that help us think through the next best ideas. And we gauge the tenor and interest of some customers, both small and large, into what kind of things they may want. A closed loop, as you know, it has to be a large enough critical mass, that there's enough interest in all parties to see the benefits of staying outside of the, we'll call it, the normal freeway. And we still haven't found that combination yet, and I don't know that we will. But we're going to keep looking for it and do our very best to use that digital environment that's advantage to us with that firing business to check it out. As it relates to tokenization, we're very fond of that because not only are we involved in it, but particularly through the clearing house, we're working on a tokenization project for all the 24 largest volume banks in the country. Clearing house, as you know, the half owner of the ACH system, the other half being the Federal Reserve. And so we're working with them on tokenization. And answering a question you didn't ask, tokenization really will solve a number of these issues, which in the interim, look like they're being solved by the chip card or the EMV solution. Those are really just a different alternative to a magnetic stripe. And at the end of the day, this tokenization is going to give us all the protections we're seeking. If you think of the Apple Pay, that's tokenization plus biometrics, which allows for a different kind of protection, and there'll be all kinds of combinations. But look, banks are going to seek whatever it can, we can, to have lower fraud losses, because as you know, most of these hacking circumstances, whether we issue the cards now or later, if there's any losses, the banks take those losses, and there's substantial amounts of money that have been in our run rates for years. And to the extent that we can find a way to make the customer safer, not make them feel burdened by having to become safer, it reduces our fraud on the other side and it creates a safer environment. Tokenization is going to provide a great solve to that, and then cybersecurity also gets an advantage as to higher levels of authentication. So I'll just say, to answer your question, we're at the leading-edge of all those topics, either because of our position in the association or because of our capability being a full-on payments provider, and we're testing all kinds of different scenarios and yet, I have nothing grand enough to announce to you here because we haven't found the holy grail yet on closed loop and we're continuing to watch for it.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. But also on tokenization, just to be clear, you could see the opportunity to use that technology not only in payments, but also in your own internal peer-to-peer or customer access to funds and funds transfer?","Richard K. Davis","Yes. And it's probably not tokenization as much as there could be a number of versions of closed loop, more protected interchanges between, let's say, large banks that could do things much more quickly. That's a different answer, as we're talking about a faster payments network and moving away from the 24-hour cycle. And we're announcing, I think, very soon, that we're all going to be working on faster payment cycles. The precursor to that, though, could be bank-to-bank or large entities-to-large entities doing intra-day transfers on a trusted basis, like you would with a friend, and accelerating what would otherwise be the natural and final evolution of the entire payment system from a 24-hour cycle to a real time. That's probably a couple of years away, but following the path of some other places around the globe and following the favor of customers, we're all working on that, and I think that's something that you'll be hearing a lot more about in the next couple of quarters.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, that makes a lot of sense, especially given the Fed white paper that asks for 10 years, which seems way too long. So then last question, just slightly separate topic, but the progress on the near-prime push in auto. Could you give us an update on how you're thinking about that and how that's impacting pretax margin?","Richard K. Davis","I'm going to have Bill answer that question.","P. W. Parker","It's been successful. It's enabled us to provide a broader spectrum of yes answers in the dealership office. So -- and we've expanded our -- in our presence in the used car market as well. And it's positive on the net -- overall net interest margin on our indirect dealer book. So it's doing well, and it's performing as we expected.","Richard K. Davis","In broader context, if we recall, so just being a prime lender to an auto dealer, now that we're doing used auto and some near-prime and the prime, we get a higher shot at getting their floor planning and getting the rest of their business, because now we're in all the categories they want, not just selectively picking prime. So there is another advantage. And I also should say we've been a leasing bank for 61 years, which is back when leasing started. So we've got a long tenure there that, I think, in a less competitive environment for auto leasing, we're going to continue to expand that. And as rates go up, trust me, that's one of the first things you'll see, is people flipping from loans to leases for payment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just a question on the expenses, Andy. I heard your comments about that kind of in the other, there seemed to be kind of a plus or minus, some offsetting. So is this the kind of the right base for expenses going forward? And to Richard's comment about staying in the low-50s efficiency ratio, what does that imply for the ability to deliver operating leverages? Is it really just about getting rates up at some point from here?","Andrew Cecere","Right, Ken. So in the third quarter, we had a couple of items that are not going to repeat. We had about just under $20 million of conversion-related expenses, principally related to our RBS acquisition, or Charter One acquisition in Chicago. Those will not repeat into the fourth quarter. The third quarter also continues to build our tax amortization for our CDC company, and that will continue to increase in the fourth quarter. That's just seasonal. And in the fourth quarter, typically, it's about $75 million or $80 million higher than the third quarter. So you'll see that, and that, again, comes down in the first quarter. All in though, I do expect positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter and I do expect our efficiency ratio will continue to be in the low-50s.","Richard K. Davis","You know what else, Ken, we're not there yet, but I think the -- we're probably at the highest level of total compliance and audit-related cost we're going to have over this cycle. I don't see them coming down right away, so I'm not saying that. But they aren't sustainably this high for the long term. So there will be another advantage and it happen probably sometime next year, where just the run rate and the expenses start to come down a bit, based on some of the focus we've all had and certain categories that we'll settle. And so it's not immediate. But I think it would be improper to believe that our current expense base, related to all that, this very quarter or the ones you've seen in the last couple, are the normal high rate, because they're not going to be that high.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Understood. Okay, great. And just a second question on just the mortgage business. This quarter you had a huge jump in origination volume, and it looks like the apps are pretty flat and it looks like the MSR hedge came down, as you had forecasted for us a quarter ago. So can you just walk us through the drivers from here on the revenue side in the mortgage business?","Andrew Cecere","Right. So in the -- as you mentioned, in the second quarter, we had a gain on servicing that did not repeat in the third quarter. If you stripped that out, we're relatively flat. And, actually, application volume was also relatively flat. Fourth quarter is typically seasonally lower. I would expect that to occur this year, and that will result in revenue being a little lower. I would call somewhere between 5% and 15%, principally, due to seasonality.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I had a question on your funding advantage. It hasn't arguably been as much of an advantage as it could be, given the strong deposit growth that we've been seeing across the industry. But I wondered if you thought that my change, particularly if QE is indeed over after this month and deposit growth starts to slow, not necessarily turn negative, just slow. So I guess a 2-part question. First, do you think deposit growth will slow, with the end of QE? And then secondly, would your funding advantage become more valuable in that kind of environment, assuming that loan growth continues?","Andrew Cecere","Right. So Bill, we do assume that at end of QE or when rates start to rise, we do assume an outflow of deposits. That's part of our rate sensitivity analysis, and I do think the funding advantage will become more explicit and clear when that occurs. It's there now because we still have some debt on the books and I think that advantage shows itself, but it will show itself more as more debt replaces deposits as rates move up. And importantly, about 15% of our deposits are corporate trust-related, which are less sensitive to rates moving up, so it's more a function of the operating model of the Corporate Trust business. So that helps us retain a core level of, particularly, DDA deposits that will be helpful as rates move up.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Great. But I was hoping maybe to follow up on that, Andy. If maybe you could separate for us the rise in rates, which there are some concerns that, that's being pushed farther out in the end of QE, which many believe is still going to happen this month. So if we have that scenario, where maybe we just set the higher rates aside for a second and just look at the impact of QE coming to an end, would that alone be enough to slow industry deposit growth and bring the funding advantage to be more -- play more of an important role?","Andrew Cecere","I think what will slow the deposit growth will be a growth in the economy and as business to start to invest more in growth and expansion and such, I think the first place they'll go is their own funds, which are currently in our balance sheet, and I think that will be the principal change. And then secondly, as rates start to move up, the opportunity cost to having money in DDA goes up, and I think you'll start to see a shift out of DDA. But when the economy starts to grow, the first place, before we see loan growth, we'll see deposit declines.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Got it. And I wanted to also follow-up on some of your comments about auto. Regulatory intervention has been in focus in auto finance, and I was hoping maybe you could just share any thoughts on the potential for the CFPB to bring nonbank auto finance companies under its oversight and what that could mean for you and the rest of the banking industry, and I guess, particularly to the extent that there are some nonbank lenders who either get pushed out or see the cost of compliance rise.","Richard K. Davis","Bill, this is Richard. I think until we see any evidence of the CFPB ring-fencing any activities with the non-banks, we're just going to presume it will stay the way it is. As you can see, it didn't stop us as a banking industry to stay in the business. We're dealing with a little higher level of risk, as it relates to the fair lending rules and things that have been said. But I think we've all gotten better at it and know what the risks are. We still are the best, I think, providers of lending to the auto businesses because of our cost of funding and because we are more traditional banks. I've heard the same thing you've heard, and I appreciate the fact that they're going to get to some of the non-banks. And I do think that if they were, that will be net positive, just because the operating paradigms will be the same for all of us. But it won't change in the near term. It wouldn't change anything we're doing at all. And I don't think, until we see evidence of it for some period of time, like a year or more, many of us are going to adjust any of our thinking, based on that. So it will take a while for them to decide which part of the space they want to get into, what it means to oversee them, what adjustments they may make. And we'll take, I think, such a substantial amount of time, that I wouldn't expect any adjustment for at least a year because it takes that long for something like that to cultivate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a few follow-ups. Bill, can you just touch a little bit on auto charge-offs and where -- what's normal for your portfolio? There's a little bit of an uptick. I'm sure it's explainable, but just maybe give us an idea of what's going on there.","P. W. Parker","Well, part of that is related to the expansion that we talked about earlier, going into the near-prime space, so some of that's coming to season. And then seasonally, there's usually higher losses in the wintertime and in the summer months. So that's all relatively normal and just most of our book is still -- even though we did expand the low-end, most of the book is still very prime, high prime portfolios. So the level of losses you see this quarter, it'll be pretty stable from there.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, good. Andy or Richard, just on the risk and compliance spending, I think that's good news that we're maybe at the peak. But can you give us an idea of the magnitude, maybe year-over-year, in terms of spending and FTEs that you have devoted to risk and compliance?","Andrew Cecere","Think about the third quarter versus a year ago, I would say we have somewhere between $30 million and $40 million of additional expense and the run rate related risk and compliance.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, all right. But you're thinking that, that is near the peak at this point?","Richard K. Davis","Yes. But I also said it stays there for a while. So in the midterm, it goes down. There's a new permanent level. You didn't ask Andy for 3 to 5 years ago, but it would be probably 3x what it was a couple of years ago. And so we're getting to that place now, and we'll just reassign some of the party. Because compliance, as you know, isn't just a unit or division. It's across every part of the business line. So even myself, team and the front lines, all need to have a more of a compliance view or call it the first line of defense, so every employee has to be thinking more appropriately about doing things perfectly the first time, and therefore, there's an extra cost in each incremental FTE. So it's not just a group we bring in, but it's the way of doing business. And we've adding that to everybody's job over the last couple of years. Plus, we've been having outside third parties, and we've added a bulked up staff in certain places to deal with regulatory issues to align with the new higher bar of heightened standards. But once we get that settled, I can see some of that going back down a bit as we get more efficient and, as you know, we're pretty efficient, once we know what the rules are.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just one more on capital return. Richard, your, sometimes, quotes get taken out of context, but you're on the record of saying that you think 2015 could take off. I'm wondering if you feel like the capital return and the current range is appropriate for next year. Do you feel like you can potentially return more? Do you feel like you need to retain some more for some maybe greater expected balance sheet growth in 2015? Just walk us through that.","Richard K. Davis","Yes, Jon, that's a hard question, right? But I'll tell you, to the extent that we can operate and have now for at least 5 years in this is very low interest rate, slow economy, I think we have proven our ability to withstand a more challenging environment. But we're looking forward to the moment when I think when rates move up, it's less a proxy for the fact that we're poised to do better when rates move up. It means that the economy is doing better, and we get way more benefit out of that. And so for me, it's approximately when the economy starts to turn up. We certainly think we can protect our capital positions, that's for sure, because we know how to manage in an environment like this. But the sooner rates move up, and again, it's a proxy for the economy doing better, the sooner we'll be able to telegraph that we'll be increasing our capital distributions. Until we see that, I'm going to stay in path and just indicate there's a positive bias that as soon as we see economy improve, we're certainly safe on what we have, but we're going to be careful on telegraphing when we can move up until we can see a more sustained revenue environment, which allows us, therefore, to predict a higher level of capital return.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just maybe, Andy, a question for you related to expenses next year. Questions have come up on a couple of earlier calls about pension expense. I think you guided, this year, that pension expense will be down about -- will be down a bit from the prior year. And I'm just curious -- I realize we're not at year-end when you set the pension rate and the -- or the discount rate and the pension expense, but how are you thinking about pension expenses affecting your overall expenses in 2015?","Andrew Cecere","Sure, Matt. So if you think about '13 and '14, because of the increase in the discount rate, we actually had a lower pension rate expense of about $130 million on an annual basis. If I were going to reset the rate today, I'd lose that $100 million or so, because rates are back to where they were a year ago. But as you said, we won't know that until the end of the year.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just a question. Richard, I think you mentioned home equity loans were growing. That's a relatively new trend. Could you give us a little more color on where that demand is coming from? Are there any geographies that are growing faster in that product specifically than you've seen in the past? And I'm just curious about any color you can provide on competition from either larger regional banks or maybe some of the smaller local banks, who are looking to get into that space as well.","Richard K. Davis","Yes. So now, let's go back to the beginning. U.S. Bancorp balance sheet doesn't have an oversized home equity portfolio. Never have. And if you look back to just the mortgage business, one of the things we didn't have going into the recession was an overly active sub-prime or near-prime mortgage business either. So we're not feeding off of a lot of runoff. We don't have a lot of deals that are coming due at their 5 or 7-year mark, that might have been originated in the earlier days. So we actually have a pretty core steady book. So for us, it's really simply a matter of the paydowns now are being outpaced by the new originations. And again, you look at the size of our portfolio, it's pretty average. And that's okay because the quality is very high. The application levels are particularly high right now and we are very aggressive in our marketing campaign with an intro rate pricing feature, and that's across the entire 25 states, and that's serving us quite well. I think when I was talking about our pricing advantages, everyone on the call rightfully jumps to Wholesale Banking and thinks about the advantages we have on cost of funds, based on our highest debt ratings, and that transcends into better rates and competitive issues on adjustable rate. But we can do it, too, on things like consumer products, as long as we match-fund it properly. And so we have a very strong new account pipeline going now, and the activation rate is even more impressive. So I'll give you an example. Our 6-month activation rate a year ago was 61%. So we get a line of credit on in 61%, within 6 months later was being used. That's now up to 77%. And so that means that we're finding better customers who really want it and need it and are using it, and increased that with the rate -- fixed rate lock option, which is another feature we've included in our advertising. And we are spending money to talk about it, in both social media and in traditional marketing that, that will be one of our leading products. If you lived in our market, like John does, you'd see the commercials and you'll hear the commercials and you see some of the social media. So we're putting a lot of energy, because we really want that to turn permanently. And we think that, that's one of the best core quality types of loans that you can have. And it's across the whole state, the whole country for us, particularly most notably in the western part, where the balances on markets are growing faster. So home appreciation is related, which totally makes a lot of sense. And I'd say our outlook for quarter 4 is to continue to see some growth in both the originations and the balance sheet. So that's a pretty positive story, off of kind of a slow starting point, but with some permanents around it now, which up until recently, might've been just 1 or 2 months and then a fall backwards, and I think we're on a sustainable growth -- pattern to growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mustascio of KBW.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Andy, I want to -- can you talk a little bit about the merchant acquiring business, the underlying trends? What I'm trying to get at, when I look at acquiring revenue per transaction, that's down about 5% year-over-year, and the acquiring spread is also down about 6% year-over-year. A bigger, a longer trend of deteriorating of those 2 metrics, can you kind of give me some color of what's going on in that business from a kind of a margin and spread perspective?","Andrew Cecere","Yes. So the DIA rate this quarter was about 40 basis points, and it is down a little bit from a year ago. Two reasons it's down. Number one is that a little bit of the margin pressure, as you talked about. I think that's beginning to stabilize. But we did see the last 12 months have some pressure on pricing. The second factor is the mix of businesses that we acquire for. So to the extent that where large retailers or airlines in particular, that there's a little thinner spread there. But I would say the decline related to margin pressure is beginning to stabilize. The rest of it will be depending upon the mix of spend in the next 12 months.","Operator","Final question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of CLSA.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I had a few follow-up questions. First, what do you estimate to be your deposit data?","Andrew Cecere","Yes, mike, this is Andy. It ranges from 5% to 90%, depending upon the deposit product. So it's not just one number. We're very detailed by product, by line.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","And on an average?","Andrew Cecere","On average, it depends upon the deposit mix we have at any point in time. But if we think about a few years ago where it was, let's say, 20 to 30, it's above that now because of the higher level of DDA and other activities we have. So it's higher than it was in our modeling.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay. Richard, you talked about the capital advantage and that gives you a pricing advantage, with higher-quality borrowers. And you said, \"Well, it's not really anything new. It's a continuation.\" But can you somehow quantify that? I mean, you do have required regulatory capital that's significantly below your much larger peers. And I'm just trying to figure out, to what degree does that give you a pricing advantage, which in turn, allows you to gain market share?","Andrew Cecere","So Mike, if you think about it, we're assuming our SIFI buffer's about 50 basis points. We don't know that. That's our assumption. That's when we get to our 8%. So if you're a G-SIB that has a 250 buffer, so let's call it 200 basis points more, and you go through the math, we would have about a 30 to 35 basis points advantage to achieve the same return or less than that and get a higher return. So it is not insignificant. It's a pretty significant advantage.","Richard K. Davis","And Mike, additionally, which we talked about, when we go in to market, if we have to issue any kind of a debt, we have an advantage to every other bank. And whatever that time period is and however much that raise was, we have that much delta to offer up. And as I said earlier, it could be the wholesale. It could even be the consumer businesses, and there's a net positive. But here's the trick, you only use it on the highest in quality customers, because otherwise, you're starting to dip down into things with loan losses and compliance costs and things you may not really understand. So for us, I'd expect you'll hear on other calls that the pricing competitiveness is still high and pretty peaked. You haven't heard that here because we're either a part of the problem or we choose to use our funding advantage to be more competitive on price, not on underwriting. And for the most part, most of the pricing seems to be pretty stable in the competitive environment as we see it, so we're not feeling disadvantaged by it either.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","So you'd go to the table and you're competing to get a large, high-quality corporate client, and you say, \"We'll price this loan 30 basis points less. Give us your business. Or 25 basis points less.\" Is that the conversation?","Andrew Cecere","I would say that's the conversation, more for the middle market. In a large client, it's more of a national funding market. And in that example, I think what the outcome is that we have a high return for the same price.","Richard K. Davis","That's right.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Isn't that somewhat similar, though, to other regional banks that also have a capital advantage versus the largest peers?","Andrew Cecere","Capital, yes. Debt rating, no.","Richard K. Davis","It's the 2fer.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","And then the last question. Richard, to follow up before, you said 2015 can take off. It's right around the corner. I think there are some quotes and data looks great, and we're all thinking, okay, if Richard Davis is right, this economy is set to take off, and then you look at the 10-year bond, which is saying the opposite. So who's right? Richard Davis or the 10-year bond?","Richard K. Davis","Wow. I've never met the 10-year bond. I'm going to go with me. But I'll tell you what. I do think, and I've said this before, too, I think the stock market is a head fake, if people using that as a measure of the quality or the wealth of -- the intention of consumers to start spending and acting. In fact, in some respects, the stronger the stock market, it's because there's nowhere else to put it. So I'm not changing my view that in '15, things turn around quickly and start to take off, because when they do take off, I think it's pretty likely they will be fast. And again, the pipelines that I'm talking about, the customer intentions I'm talking about, that's what we're waiting for: the final decision when rates start to move, which will create this, I think, tsunami effect of people acting quickly. I'm going to stick to what I said before, and I think it's next year. And when it does, it happens fast. I don't have any evidence that says otherwise, and I'm not responding to the vagaries of 2 weeks of either 10-year interest rates or stock market variances. I'm just going to stick with it.","Operator","That was our final question. Presenters, do you have any closing remarks?","Sean O'Connor","Well, thank you for listening to our call, and please call me this afternoon if you have any further questions.

Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Terry Dolan, U.S. Bancorp\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon, EDT, through Wednesday, July 25 at 12:00 midnight, EDT.","I will now turn the conference call over to Jenn Thompson, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.","Jenn Thompson","Thank you, Jack, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Andy Cecere, Terry Dolan, and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s second quarter results and to answer your questions. Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.","I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today\u2019s presentation, in our press release, and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Andy.","Andrew Cecere","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry and I will open the call up to Q&A. I\u2019ll start on Slide 3. In the second quarter, we reported record net income and record earnings per share driven by record revenue and positive operating leverage. Excluding the impact of our student loan sale, loan growth picked up compared with last quarter even as we remain disciplined in our Commercial Real Estate underwriting.","On the right side of Slide 3, you can see that credit quality improved in the second quarter and our book value per share increased by 5.8% from a year-ago. During the quarter, we returned 69% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. In the second quarter, the Federal Reserve completed its annual stress tests, and once again the results confirmed our ability to withstand and remain profitable in severely adverse economic conditions. Based on the stress test results, our Board of Directors approved a 23% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.37 per common share beginning in the third quarter as well as a 15% increase in our stock repurchase authorization.","Slide 4, highlights our best-in-class performance metrics, including a 19.8% return on tangible common equity. Our efficiency ratio, return on average assets, and return on average common equity all improved sequentially and on a year-over-year basis.","Now let me turn the call over to Terry, who will provide more detail on the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance.","Terrance Dolan","Thanks Andy. If you turn to Slide 5, I\u2019ll start with a balance sheet review and follow-up with a discussion of earnings trends. Excluding the student loans sold this quarter, average loans grew to 0.3% on a linked-quarter basis and increased 1.8% compared with the second quarter of 2017. We saw continued strength in retail portfolios such as mortgage and retail leasing.","Credit card transaction volume grew, and the growth was strong and supportive of a robust fee growth. However, revolve rates have been declining, reflective of a strong economy and the strong credit quality of our customer base, which is muting balanced growth. Commercial middle-market loan growth accelerated to 2.2% sequentially in the second quarter. However, paydown activity among large corporate customers continued to be a headwind to total commercial loan growth.","Line utilization remains at historical lows. However, pipelines continued to improve, and commitments grew. Clients are optimistic, and we are starting to see customers deploy deposit balances to fund business investment. While the timing of more robust CapEx activity is uncertain, we continue to expect that moderating paydowns and increased M&A closings will support improved commercial loan growth in the second half of the year.","Commercial Real Estate loans declined in the second quarter, reflecting our decisions not to extend credit on unfavorable terms and elevating paydowns as customers seek alternative financing. This quarter, Commercial Real Estate contributed a 20 basis point drag to linked-quarter growth and a 140 basis point reduction to year-over-year average loan growth.","Turning to Slide 6. Lower deposit growth relative to prior periods was driven by stronger economic conditions. Business customers are beginning to deploy balances to fund capital investments. Also, the impact of rising interest rates on deposit earnings credits have reduced their need to maintain non-interest bearing deposits.","Finally, there is some migration of balances to interest-bearing deposits for alternative investment vehicles as customers seek higher yields. These deposit flows are consistent with our asset liability modeling expectations.","Slide 7 indicates that credit quality improved in the second quarter due to improving economic conditions with customer paydowns resulting in pressure on loan balances with an improved credit profile. Notably, our non-performing assets declined 9.4% compared with the first quarter and decreased 19.1% compared with the second quarter of 2017.","Slide 8 provides highlights of second quarter earnings results, including a 7.5% sequential increase in pretax income and a 5.1% increase in net income available to common.","On Slide 9, linked-quarter and year-over-year net interest income growth was supported by higher interest rates and earning asset growth, which was partially offset by a shift in deposit and funding mix. Additionally, year-over-year growth was negatively impacted by tax reform, which reduced the taxable equivalent adjustment benefit related to tax exempt assets.","In the second quarter, the net interest margin was 3.13%, flat with the linked-quarter, but higher by 5 basis points compared with a year-ago. The impact of tax reform on taxable equivalent earning assets hurt year-over-year net interest margin expansion by 2 basis points.","Our interest-bearing deposit betas continued to perform in line with our expectations during the last few rate hikes. As future rate hikes occur, we continue to expect our deposit beta will trend toward a 50% level, which compares with the current level about 45%. The betas on our commercial and trust deposit basis, which represent about half of our total deposits, are in line with their estimated terminal betas. We expect that movement in the overall beta going forward will primarily be driven by our consumer deposit base.","Slide 10 highlights trends in non-interest income. On a year-over-year basis, we had strong growth in payments revenue and trust and investment management revenue, partially by a decrease in commercial product revenue and mortgage banking revenue. Mortgage revenue was affected by lower refinancing activity and lower gain on sale margins. Treasury management fees declined, reflecting the impact of changes in earnings credit, which is typical in a rising rate environment.","Looking closer at our payments business on a year-over-year basis, we had strong growth in credit and debit card revenue and double-digit growth in our corporate payment products revenue, each reflecting higher sales volumes. It's worth noting that this quarter mark the best revenue growth performance in corporate payments in over seven years.","Merchant processing revenue growth continued to be impacted by our exits from two joint ventures last year, but we continue to expect that it will return to a mid single-digit growth pace by the third quarter of 2018. Merchant acquiring sales volumes continue to support our expectations. Trust and investment management growth, fee growth was driven by business growth and favorable market conditions.","Turning to Slide 11, non-interest expense increased 1% on a linked-quarter basis and 3.4% on the year-over-year basis in line with our expectation. Compensation expense increased principally due to the impact of hiring to support business growth and compliance programs, merit increases and higher variable compensation related to business production.","Notably within non-personnel expenses, professional service expense declined from a year-ago, primarily due to fewer consulting services as compliance programs near maturity. We expect compliance related cost to continue to moderate through the year. In addition, mortgage service and related costs are declining due to favorable economic conditions.","Slide 12 highlights our capital position, at June 30, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach was 9.1%. This compares to our capital target of 8.5%.","I will now provide some forward-looking guidance. For the third quarter, we expect fully taxable equivalent, net interest income to increase in the low single-digit range on a year-over-year basis. We expect fee revenue to increase in a low single-digit range year-over-year.","On a year-over-year basis, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage in the third quarter and for the full-year of 2018. We expect credit quality to remain relatively stable, compared with the second quarter. Our year-over-year tax rate on a taxable equivalent basis is estimated to be 21%.","I\u2019ll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.","Andrew Cecere","Thanks Terry. We are building on a firm foundation and I'll leave you with two goals, our entire management team is focused on as we head into the second half of 2018. Number one, growing revenues while maintaining our credit discipline. We are willing to forego growth in areas where the risk-reward dynamics don't make sense, like certain areas commercial real estate or higher risk leverage lending in the corporate space.","Risk management is a core competency, but this is not mean, we will forgo revenue growth. We have a broad enough set of businesses that enable us to efficiently and dynamically allocate capital to areas where we expect the best growth and risk adjusted returns.","We are optimistic about our ability to continue to gain share in both retail lending and commercial lending. And as paydown pressure subside and existing pipelines are funded that market share growth will be evident.","I feel very good about the outlook for our fee businesses. Momentum is building in retail and corporate payment services, wealth management and trust and investment services, and we expect the third quarter to mark an inflection point in merchant servicing revenue. Cyclical headwinds facing mortgage will abate over time and we are positioning that business to thrive in the purchase mortgage market.","Number two, our management team is focused on investing for the future while delivering positive operating leverage. As we discussed previously, we are stepping up our business investment in digital-first capabilities, revenue enhancing initiatives and business automation as we position this company for the future.","These investments enable us to stay at the forefront in banking and will drive improving operating leverage over the next several years. However, we are mindful that we need to manage expenses for whatever revenue environment we are operating in and we are in committed to delivering positive operating leverage this year and going forward.","In closing, I\u2019m pleased with our second quarter results and I am optimistic as I look out to the remainder of this year and beyond. I want to thank our employees for their hard work and commitment to serving our customers and earning their trust every day.","That concludes our formal remarks. Terry, Bill and I will now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Your line is open.","John McDonald","Hi. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask a little bit about expenses and operating leverage. It looks like you delivered about 10 basis points of positive operating leverage this quarter, which is an improvement and I was just wondering when you look ahead to the third and fourth quarter, would you expect increased magnitude of operating leverage? Do you expect that to widen out? And if so, what would be the drivers?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. John, this is Terry Dolan. Thanks for the question. When we end up looking for the third and fourth quarter, I think that we will deliver positive operating leverage, although I think it will still be relatively narrow. We do expect that as we kind of get into 2019 and into 2020 that that wedge of revenue growth versus expenses will start to widen and toward that 2% to 3%, which is a part of our long-term growth expectations, but for the balance of 2018, we would expect it to be fairly narrow.","John McDonald","Okay. And just on that point, Terry for this year, the expenses this quarter came in a little better than expected. Does that help you to get in a little closer to the lower end of the 3% to 5% expense range for this year? Or you still expecting the high-end and does that forecast for this year include any change in the FDIC surcharge for the end of this year?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. With respect to the FDIC charge, we're really expecting that. We're going to have to continue to pay that through the balance of the year. But coming back to expenses, we recognize just like the rest of the industry that we're kind of in a transitional period with respect to tax reform.","And I would say that just \u2013 as put some challenges with respect to loan growth and as a result revenue growth. And as Andy and I have said, we're always balancing short-term versus long-term and I would say with respect to the second quarter and the balance the year, well we're going to continue to make investments in those long-term digital capabilities and strategic areas of focus.","We're going to be very disciplined with respect to looking at discretionary spend and areas where we cut back and so we're definitely going to be managed to the lower end and with respect to our expectations to revenue growth at that point.","John McDonald","Okay. So this year you are still looking at kind of upper end of the 3% to 5% expense range and then next year\u2026?","Terrance Dolan","No, we are at the lower end of the range.","Andrew Cecere","Lower end.","John McDonald","Got it. Okay, good. This trend \u2013 this quarter comes in better, so you are looking at lower end this year and then next year as well?","Terrance Dolan","Yes.","John McDonald","Okay. Got it. Thanks guys.","Andrew Cecere","Thanks John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Andrew Cecere","Hi, Matt. Good morning","Matthew O'Connor","Just to follow-up on the expenses. Obviously a positive messaging on slowing the growth and you mentioned working towards the 2% to 3% operating leverage in 2019 and 2020. Is that \u2013 when you say working towards, are you hoping to be in that range next year, if I can try and pinpoint you on that? Or is that something that's going to take a couple years to get to the 2% to 3% operating leverage?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. I think that, that is \u2013 we're starting from something that\u2019s very narrow, so it's going to take some time in order for us to be able to get there. But I would expect continued improvement in quarters as we go sequentially throughout 2019 Matt.","Matthew O'Connor","Okay. So maybe like a 1% to 2% operating leverage next year and then in 2020 you're thinking the 2% to 3%. Is that a reasonable thought process?","Terrance Dolan","We\u2019ll continue to make improvements. That\u2019s going to depend on the revenue outlook, which is going to be very dependent upon loan growth and the economy overall. We're going to manage that positive. We\u2019re going to manage to expanding that positive.","Matthew O'Connor","Okay. And then just separately on the net interest margin. Obviously, flat NIM linked-quarter. Is there still leverage to rates going up? The curve isn\u2019t helping, but just talk about kind of the NIM trajectory not just next quarter, but as we think through the next few quarters, what some of the puts and takes are there and if there's an upward bias or think about it being flat?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. So again, for the second quarter, we were flat first quarter at 3.13%, but else being equal, we would have expected that to expand by a couple of basis points during the quarter. But there are a couple of different things that I would just point out. First is in the credit card space and it tends to fluctuate, but if revolve rates were a little lower during the quarter and that ended up impacting NIM relative to kind of what we were expecting.","Second is that we sold a student loan portfolio, and that had an effect. And then the third is that we took the opportunity early in the quarter to hedge some of our LIBOR-based long-term debt and fix it, and that had a time zero hit or impact to us, but it should help us a little bit as we think about the future.","Those three things really represent 2 basis points and so that hopefully helps kind of frame it. We think about the third quarter and into the fourth quarter, we do expect and believe there's opportunity for NIM expansion. Our securities portfolio continues to be accretive in that 100 basis points to 125 basis points as we\u2019re replacing securities. As loans grow and we have an outlook that loan \u2013 our loan outlook is that loans will grow. And with that and the right mix of loans, we would expect to see margin expansion as well. So we do think there's opportunity for that.","Matthew O'Connor","Okay. Thank you.","Terrance Dolan","Thanks Matt.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning.","Andrew Cecere","Good morning.","Terrance Dolan","Good morning, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Couple questions. One on the loan growth outlook. I'm hearing that you are very clearly retaining credit quality. And so my question is, is that \u2013 does that drive to a slightly slower outlook than you've been delivering? In other words, is there a narrowing of the credit box that has an impact? Or is there a narrowing of the credit box that has potentially runoffs increasing in the loan book?","Andrew Cecere","Betsy, this is Andy. And the short answer to your question is no. We're not narrowing the credit box. We\u2019re remaining disciplined as we always have been, and in fact, we have confidence that loan growth will accelerate. Our pipelines are as strong as they've been in a long time. The impacts that we think from a tax reform are starting to dissipate. The consumer spend numbers are high. Corporate payment spend activity is high, payables and T&E. So there's a lot of confidence out there, and I think, actually, loan growth will accelerate.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. So the NII up low single-digit year-on-year is more about NIM as opposed to loan growth is that accurate?","Andrew Cecere","No, I mean, I think that is kind of a combination of both. I mean if you remember in the first quarter, we were growing at 0.1%. Now we\u2019re at 0.3%. And we're going to continue to see that expand and improve. But it's not going to go hog wild in the third quarter. I mean, we would say that it's going to be moderately growing in the third quarter. So that\u2019s kind of our expectation.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Got it. So some of the trimming of \u2013 around the edges, like in the student loan book or \u2013 I mean, we saw some shrinkage in CRE. Is that pretty much over at the stage?","Andrew Cecere","Well, student loan book is no longer in the numbers, actually. The CRE probably will continue to lag because of what we're seeing in the marketplace and that's an area that we're not becoming more disciplined or tightening of credit box, but we have been more disciplined historically, and we\u2019ll continue to maintain that.","Betsy Graseck","Yes. I get that Andy. And on the student loan piece, my question was really more about other portfolios that you would be looking to trim? Or are you finished with\u2026","Andrew Cecere","Yes. Betsy, we\u2019re \u2013 obviously we\u2019re always looking at different alternatives and different things to look at, especially portfolios that might be in runoff status and don't have any long-term strategic benefit to the company. But there's nothing that is on the immediate horizon that we would point to, right?","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And the faster growth in C&I that you've got this quarter is part of the optimism on the loan growth from here?","Andrew Cecere","Yes, that\u2019s particularly true, Betsy, in the middle market, what just Terry mentioned in his remarks was up 2.2% on a linked-quarter growth. We\u2019re seeing strong activity there.","Terrance Dolan","Yes. And then I think the other positive thing about that is that, that growth we're seeing really across many markets is fairly broad-based at this particular point in time. And the effect of paydowns was dissipated in that space as well. The other thing I would add is that our community banking markets saw some nice growth in the second quarter. We would expect that to continue in the third.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Thanks so much.","Andrew Cecere","Thanks Betsy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Andrew Cecere","Hey, John. How are you doing?","John Pancari","All right. On the loan growth side, back to commercial, end-of-period balance came in above the average balance? Is that a better number to work off of? Is that level sustainable in terms of where we\u2019ll grow off of?","Andrew Cecere","Yes, I mean what I would say John is that certainly when you end up looking at ending versus average, we started to see strength in the latter half of the second quarter and in all the different factors that we ended up talking about, we also saw paydown starting to dissipate a little bit more in the second half of the second quarter. So I think that that is a good way of looking at the loan growth outlook.","John Pancari","Okay, good. And then any impact that you\u2019re seeing on the \u2013 from tariffs on commercial demand?","Bill Parker","Not on demand. This is Bill. You can read in the papers, the specific companies that maybe impacted, but we have not seen that in any kind of \u2013 even that in the industry level. We really have not seen any impact of the tariffs. So obviously we continue to monitor closely. But if it stays at this level, we don\u2019t really anticipate any impact.","John Pancari","Okay, all right. And then lastly on the deposit side, just want to get a bit more color on the deposit moves in the quarter that you saw, I know end-of-period balance is down 1% flat on an average basis. Is there \u2013 are you starting to see a pick-up in the shifts in deposits and anything else that\u2019s impacting the growth and what your outlook would be there as well would be helpful?","Terrance Dolan","Yes, on the deposit side again, what I would say is that whether its betas or whether it's just the flow of deposits, it\u2019s very much in line with the way we have been modeling our asset liability sensitivities, so there really hasn't been any unusual expectations. We've always said that corporate or commercial deposits, we will start to see outflows when the economy gets stronger and I think we're seeing that.","We're not seeing a lot of rotation, and in fact, we are seeing growth in the consumer side, which is good to see. And then our corporate trust balances, especially in the second quarter because of timing of bond payments and that sort of thing turns to fluctuate a lot. So I guess where I'd leave it is that everything is really on track with respect to our expectations.","John Pancari","Okay, got it. Thanks, Terry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Kenneth Usdin","Thanks a lot. Hey guys, a couple small ones. Can you help us understand how much NII went to weigh with the student loan sale and how much was in that other fee line related to the gain?","Terrance Dolan","Yes, I would say that the gain impact is very insignificant, and if you've seen other student loan portfolio sales, you don't see a significant premium with respect to that. So gain was very small. And from a net interest income standpoint, again kind of coming back to my point around 2 basis points, I mean you can kind of back into that in being about the third of that overall equation.","Kenneth Usdin","Okay. And then so that's means in other fees than \u2013 but you had with the VC\/PE stuff pretty big again, outsize would you say?","Terrance Dolan","Well, that that category tends to be pretty lumpy and there's a lot of different things that end up going into in terms of retail product revenue, insurance sales, insurance product sales, everything. So it's not any one particular item in the second quarter that really has caused that to move.","Kenneth Usdin","Okay, got it. On the expense side, just one question about the third quarter comps, now that we've gotten a couple quarters into the post tax reform changes. Do you expect the seasonal upward trend in the tax benefit related expenses and that's included in your kind of operating leverage guide because I just try to understand if you're saying low single-digit NII and low single-digit fees that kind of means low single-digit expenses and that's inclusive of any bump up in the tax advantage expense?","Terrance Dolan","Absolutely. There will be a bump up. There always is because of those seasonality of that particular business and a lot of tax credit projects been completed in the third and fourth quarter, particularly late in the fourth quarter, but yes it absolutely includes everything.","Kenneth Usdin","Okay. And last one, are you expecting \u2013 in terms of the year operating leverage? Are you expecting the FDIC to go out by year end, if so can you help us size what you think it will be?","Terrance Dolan","Well, the FDIC surcharge, we expect that it's going to continue through at least the end of the year and as I look into 2019, they say they're going to pull it back, but at this particular point in time, who knows.","Andrew Cecere","The guidance we\u2019ve been giving is not assuming any change in the FDIC.","Kenneth Usdin","Right, okay. So there's the positive operating leverage even with that staying in there. Got it, thank you.","Andrew Cecere","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning.","Andrew Cecere","Hi, Erika. How are you doing?","Erika Najarian","Good. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about your comments on corporate payments and one of the strongest quarters you\u2019ve absorbed. Is that a leading indicator for the rest of the year and sort of what's the lag in terms of that being a potential leading indicator for corporate activity on the financing side?","Andrew Cecere","Erika, that\u2019s a great question. And we look at that corporate payments spend, especially on the commercial side as a leading indicator with respect to basically corporate confidence and their willingness to spend on both discretionary items as well as capital expenditures. So the fact is that is growing, gives us more confidence that when we look into the future that they have confidence that business continues to expand and grow and that's part of the calculus as we kind of think about the loan outlook.","Terrance Dolan","And Erika just to give you some numbers, the sales volume growth, spend volume so to speak, this quarter versus year-ago were up 11.7% and a year-ago those numbers were 6.4%, so it's almost doubled in terms of the activity from a corporate spend perspective.","Erika Najarian","That was helpful. Thank you. On the consumer side, Andy you talked about confidence in terms of growing both corporate and consumer, could you remind us a little bit about your offering in the premium card space? I know one of your larger peers just introduced a premium card that's available outside of their deposit network, which is unusual for them, but just wondering sort of what you're observing about competitive dynamics and how you think your premium card is positioned and what the take up has been with your customer base?","Andrew Cecere","We have a full array of card products, including a premium card that we call the Altitude Card. The Altitude Card is principally for core customers already with U.S. Bank, and then the uptake has been tremendous. It's a great card. One of the attributes of that card is the mobile component and it has multiple points and rewards. And so it is really intended to the choice to be first in your mobile or digital wallet and the uptake has been very positive.","Erika Najarian","And just lastly on the comments earlier about the consumer deposit pricing really driving deposit rates from here. I\u2019m wondering if you could give us an update on potentially launching a national product and what products would you lead with and sort of what you've observed with regards to competition picking up or not picking up on the retail side.","Andrew Cecere","Yes. We have a number of initiatives underway, Erika. But the one I'd highlight is really trying to extend beyond our current branch geographic 25-state positioning beyond that where we already have a customer base. So we are a national player in both our mortgage lending as well as our auto lending through our indirect network. And our opportunity is to expand the relationship with those customers. We already have a relationship with the U.S. Bank through mortgage or indirect to include depository and other opportunities in terms of bank products and that's where our focus is.","Erika Najarian","Just to clarify, I\u2019ll have to \u2013 you\u2019re marketing directly to your national clients or outside of the 25-state geography that already have a products are similar to card, this is something that\u2019s \u2013 for your current client base, and it's not necessarily available to somebody that was just going on bankrate.com and shopping for a money market account or CD?","Andrew Cecere","They certainly could do that. But our focus in terms of [leveraging] growth is against the current customer base because again, they already have a relationship with the U.S. Bank. It's not a full bank relationship. It's typically a single product relationship, typically a mortgage or an auto loan and our opportunities to expand upon that relationship.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you.","Andrew Cecere","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Mike Mayo","Hi. I have one cyclical question and one structural question. The cyclical question, you seem to be very positive about the economy. I guess, I think I heard you correctly, accelerating loan growth and corporate spend and payments is twice as fast as a year-ago. So given that view, do you think that the yield curve will steepen? And do you back up that view with how you position the balance sheet? Or the big debate about the flatter yield curve, does it foreshadow a downturn, but it seems like you're saying the opposite, so you kind of make investments to go against the recent movement in the yield curve?","Andrew Cecere","So Mike I\u2019m going to start and then ask Terry to add on. I do think we do have confidence in the economy from small business to middle market to large corporate, confidence is up. Activity is up. On the consumer side of the equation, spend is up and activity is up there too. So we do have confidence, pipelines are strong. We talk to our leaders and our lenders and they\u2019re talking to their customers. Things are very positive. Credit is very good as you know. So those are all positive indicators.","The yield curve does say something different today and there could be other components to that that\u2019s driving that differential. And Terry \u2013 from a positioning standpoint, we're not assuming that there's going to be a steepening in the short-term.","Terrance Dolan","Right. That's exactly right. So when we are looking at our interest rate modeling and are looking at our forecast with respect to revenue growth et cetera, we're continuing to assume that the yield curve remains fairly flat as the short end rises. If you end up looking at the spread between two-year and 10-year treasury, we're kind of expecting that, it's going to stay in that ballpark and not really changing that perspective.","Mike Mayo","Well, it's not a disconnect. I mean, you seem pretty [bulled] up on the economy, which would imply a steeper yield curve. Or are you just being conservative? Or are you assuming tactical QE factors still stay in place?","Andrew Cecere","Well, I think that until we actually see the yield curve steepening, I think we're going to be \u2013 the way we model and the way we think about forecasting, we're just going to be conservative and take that point of view.","Mike Mayo","Okay. And then the structural question, to follow-up on the last line of discussion. So this strategy to expand outside of your 25-state network to cross-sell to mortgage and auto customers that could potentially take you to all 50 states or most of the states and what gives you confidence that that strategy will succeed. And the opposite of that strategy, it seems like everyone's doing a national digital bank now, from Citigroup, PNC, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and we tend to hear Minneapolis pop up every now and then.","So these competitors from a thousand miles away are coming into Minneapolis trying to cross-sell to customers in your backyard. So I guess, the question is how do you defend against those other banks that are coming to your backyard to try to steal away your customers and how do you think you can go ahead and cross-sell to your customers where you don't have a branch presence?","Andrew Cecere","So Mike, I will tell you in Minneapolis and in our core markets, we have not seen movement or lost customer base, either on the wholesale or in the consumer side from some of these new entrants. I\u2019ll start there. Secondly, while you can enter all the states, we're going to focus on a few, and we're going to continue to test, learn, and try different things.","Number three, as I think if you go into a market without a customer base and you either compete on price or product you could get negative selection. So that's why we're focused on current customers, who already have a relationship with the bank, who we can expand that relationship with other products and services, because they already have U.S. Bank as part of their wallet, so to speak, part of their relationship. We think that's the way to do it, and again, we're focused on a few markets as we started out and we'll continue to update you on the results as we go forward.","Mike Mayo","Okay. And when did you start this recent initiative? Is it like\u2026","Andrew Cecere","This year. We're starting it this year.","Mike Mayo","Okay. Great. All right. Thanks a lot.","Andrew Cecere","You bet, Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Kevin Barker","Good morning.","Andrew Cecere","Hi, Kevin. Good morning.","Kevin Barker","In regards to some of the outlook for revenue growth, and obviously, you expect a flattening yield curve, is there any acceleration of deposit betas beyond what you've already seen within your numbers? And do you expect asset yields to continue to move higher despite the flattening yield curve?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. So on the deposit side, as we said in the \u2013 some of the remarks, when you end up looking at the commercial corporate world and you look at corporate trust or deposit. We really feel that those are at kind of their terminal betas and so as rates move up, we would move kind of block step with it. But we wouldn't necessarily see an expansion or narrowing to that.","The real question is more on the consumer side of the equation. Consumer beta is there kind of in that 15% range and they will typically migrate towards 30%. But the question is over what period of time? We haven't seen a lot of pressure. The pressure is there. It is more on the affluent side, which we've been responsive too. And we price in a lot of different markets and so we keep our ear to the ground so to speak, but it really come down to how quickly consumer deposits move.","On the asset side, as we have talked in the past, our \u2013 if you end up looking at our balance sheet, we benefit both on the short-end and on the long-end about 50\/50. As rates continue to move up, I think that there's opportunity there. The other thing I would say is again coming back to our securities portfolio \u2013 will continue to be accretive for several quarters, many quarters. And as the residential mortgage portfolio rotates and some of our longer-term assets rotate, we'll see accretive benefit associated with that as well.","Kevin Barker","Great. Thank you. And then regards to mortgage banking question, I noticed that the origination numbers quarter-over-quarter appear to show that you\u2019ve let market share to go. Are you making a conscious decision to pullback from the market, given the competitive dynamics that are occurring right now in the mortgage space?","Andrew Cecere","Yes. In the mortgage space, our app volume on a linked-quarter basis was actually up about 8%. And so we continue to, I think feel like we're in a pretty good spot in taking market share. I will tell you that it's very competitive, margins are thin. There's a lot of capacity that\u2019s out there. But we have shifted our focus more toward purchase mortgages. We started that about two years ago, two, three years ago. We also focused on the retail channel. The margins tend to be better in the retail channel.","I think what you are seen in the industry is really more on the correspondence side, where the margins have been very thin and people have been kind of pulling back and we're from a pricing standpoint. We're remaining competitive, but just given where margins are. We're being prudent about that as well.","Kevin Barker","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Vivek Juneja","Hi.","Andrew Cecere","Hi, Vivek.","Vivek Juneja","Hi, and thanks for taking the questions. A couple of questions here, corporate payments, I wanted to get a little more granularity. How's government spend been doing, Andy, Terry? I know you've talked that in the past\u2026?","Andrew Cecere","Yes. Government spend is also up, Vivek, as spend year-over-year was up 9.8% in the second quarter of 2018. That compares to relatively flat or even down 1% last year. So that is also strengthening.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. And how does the fee rate on that, Andy, compare with the rest of corporate payments?","Andrew Cecere","The fees on both our substantial are fine. There hasn't been a decline in those. So you can see that the revenue for both have also increased in the same relative vein. So commercial spend volumes were up 11.7% and the revenue was up 12%. The government spend was up 9.8%, and revenue was up 11.8%.","Terrance Dolan","Yes. On the government side Vivek, remember that those contracts tend to be very long-term and so from a pricing perspective, you see the pressure when the contract get renegotiated, but generally during the term they stay pretty consistent.","Andrew Cecere","And they\u2019re relatively comparable for that between the two.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. Another one cards, you talked about the decrease in revolvers. How much of that do you think is coming from just this increased price competition in the industry from promotional balances?","Terrance Dolan","I wouldn't necessarily attribute it as much to that and I think that what we end up seeing when the economy gets stronger and consumer confidence goes up, you ended tend to see more spend, but balances the revolve rate actually comes down a little bit, simply because people have the capacity to be able to make those payments.","Then I think the other thing that we are seeing right now is just with tax reform, there's a little more cash in people's pockets and they're taking that opportunity to reduce the revolving part of their balances. So I think it's probably more so that than anything.","Andrew Cecere","And Terry, I'd add the high quality nature of our portfolio.","Terrance Dolan","Yes, for us. Yes.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. Thank you.","Andrew Cecere","Sure.","Terrance Dolan","Thanks, Vivek.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Your line is open.","Andrew Cecere","Hey, Saul.","Saul Martinez","Hi. Good morning, guys. A couple questions, first clarification on your comments on deposit betas, so Terry you mentioned that going forward you would expect around 50%, it was around 45%, I think this quarter. So should we take that as meaning the 12 basis points increase in deposit cost you saw this quarter more or less with future hikes that sort of the magnitude we should be thinking about in terms of increased deposit costs?","Terrance Dolan","It\u2019s a reasonable assumption, yes.","Saul Martinez","Okay. And that bakes in \u2013 that already bakes in the increase in the consumer deposit beta you mentioned from 15% to 30%. You mean you mentioned the commercial and I guess, trust already \u2013 the corporate trust is already up terminal beta?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. I would say that currently, it's at 15% and it\u2019s going to continue. The question is over what period of time? I don't know if it'll be in the next rate hike after that. So it's kind of from a timing standpoint. Those betas will move up a little bit to 12, maybe 13 basis points for a 25 basis point movement et cetera, but it's not going to be dramatic anymore I don't think.","Saul Martinez","Okay. But you don't think it's a big meaningful move up from here, from the starting point?","Terrance Dolan","No, we don\u2019t.","Saul Martinez","Okay. And then a follow-up on the discussion on sustainable positive operating leverage of 200 basis points to 300 basis points. I know it take some time to get there, but your long \u2013 I think that's based on the assumption of 6% to 8% revenue growth long-term, 3% to 5% cost growth and that's how you get to 200 basis point to 300 basis point. But to the extent revenue growth doesn't materialize in that fashion? How much room do you have to manage expenses down below that 3% to 5% range and keep that 200 basis points to 300 basis points?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. Saul, way I would kind of think about is not only from a revenue standpoint, but as we continue to make investments in digital capabilities, those digital capabilities are going to offer us opportunities to be able to streamline or improve our cost basis or cost structure as well. So I think it\u2019s really kind of a \u2013 we have to think about it from both sides of the equation, I think as everything over the next three years or so.","Saul Martinez","Got it. So does that mean if the revenue backdrop doesn't materialize because I think most of us probably don't have 6% to 8% revenue growth in our model for most banks? Should I take that answer saying is meaning you can manage it down below that or you just have investments you need to make and cost growth is going to be sort of within that range regardless of the revenue environment?","Andrew Cecere","So I think Saul, the easy way to think about it is the higher the revenue growth the wider that wedge between revenue and expense will be. To the extent, the revenue growth is narrow that wedge will be in a more narrow because it's just going to be a function of revenue growth in the long-term.","Saul Martinez","Okay. All right. Got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Andrew Cecere","Hey, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning, Terry. Good morning, Andy. Can you guys give us a little more color on the commercial loan book? Obviously, you pointed out that the Commercial Real Estate outstandings came down due to paydowns, but also underwriting standards that are not up to your standard. If you look at it carefully, how much went \u2013 the decline? How much was due to the paydown versus underwriting standards? And then in commercial lending, C&I lending, I think you said you also had some paydowns. Where is the outside money coming? Is it other banks taking those loans or is it the private equity market shadow banking industry?","Bill Parker","Yes. So this is Bill. SO on commercial real estate, where we lose balances is in what we call the standing loans or longer term mortgages and that's the area that's gotten aggressive really in terms of terms and rate. Many of that outside the banking community and so that's where we've seen the runoff. The other big portion in CRE is construction lending. We remain very, very active there. We haven't seen \u2013 it\u2019s been relatively stable. It hasn\u2019t really seen a runoff. But that's an area that we remain very active, very \u2013 add great value to clients. We watch the markets carefully, but for good clients will continue to do the construction lending.","And then on a C&I side, that's really more a function \u2013 some of the larger M&A deals, but we\u2019ve seen good pipeline growth coming into the end of the quarter and into this quarter. So we anticipate that that paydown activity should subside as we see more M&A transactions closed, in addition to \u2013 as was previously mentioned, some of the kind of core growth in our community and middle market books.","Gerard Cassidy","Bill, as a follow-up to that, your comments about the term commercial real estate mortgage market, can you compare it today the terms that are being used to 2005, 2006? Is it that stretched or we're not there yet in those types of...","Bill Parker","No, I think it\u2019s \u2013 I would say it's not that stretched, but it more a function of the length of term and rate that people are offering. Our bank \u2013 and specifically we\u2019re not interested in doing a fixed rate 15-year loans. That\u2019s just does not fit well with our models, so \u2013 but there are whether it's the securitization market that can accommodate that or insurance companies can accommodate that.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And then as a general question, Terry, you touched upon the operating expense growth being at the lower end of the 3% to 5% range that you gave us? Have you guys seen any \u2013 we hear a lot nationally about the employment situation, very strong, maybe a labor shortage in certain markets and certain industries.","Do you guys see any of that in your commercial bank with office \u2013 loan officers or branch managers? And if you don't see it, is there something on the horizon that makes you a little nervous that you could see it in 12 months if the economy turns out to be as strong as we all hope?","Andrew Cecere","Yes, I think \u2013 this is Andy. I think what we actually \u2013 it\u2019s taking longer to fill positions. And so I would say that there's a bit of a tightening labor market and that's impacting our hiring. It\u2019s not substantially increasing pay yet, but I do think that could happen. But right now it's just taking longer to fill positions.","Gerard Cassidy","I appreciate that. Thank you, Andy.","End of Q&A","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

Following the review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Cecere, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon Eastern Daylight Time through Wednesday, July 24 at 12:00 midnight Eastern Daylight Time.","I will now turn the conference call over to Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.","Judith T. Murphy","Thank you, Lorie, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's second quarter 2013 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules, are available on our website at usbank.com.","I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Richard.","Richard K. Davis","Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review U.S. Bank's second quarter results. I'll begin with a view of our quarterly highlights on Page 3 of the presentation.","U.S. Bancorp reported record net income of $1.5 billion for the second quarter of 2013 or $0.76 per diluted common share. Total average loans grew year-over-year by 5.2% and 1.2% or 5% annualized on a linked quarter basis. We experienced strong loan growth in total average -- strong growth in total average deposits of 7% over the prior year and 1% or 4% annualized linked quarter. Credit quality remained strong.","Total net charge-offs decreased by 9.5% from the prior quarter, while nonperforming assets declined linked quarter by 5.4%.","We generated significant capital this quarter. Our estimated Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III rules issued in early July was 8.6% at June 30, while our Basel I Tier 1 common equity ratio was 9.2% and our Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.1%. We purchased 18 million shares of common stock during the second quarter. These buybacks, along with our dividend, which was increased by 18% in June, resulted in a 73% return of earnings to our shareholders in the second quarter.","On Slide 4, you can see that our performance metrics continue to be among the best in the industry. Return on average assets in the second quarter was 1.7%. The return on average common equity was 16.1%. Our net interest margin and efficiency ratio are shown on the graph on the right-hand slide -- side of Slide 4. This quarter's net interest margin of 3.43% was, as expected, 5 basis points lower than the prior quarter's rate of 3.48%. And Andy will discuss the margin in more detail in just a few minutes.","Our efficiency ratio for the second quarter was 51.7%. We anticipate that this ratio will remain in the low-50s going forward as we continue to manage expenses in relation to revenue trends, while continue to invest in and grow our businesses.","Turning to Slide 5. The company reported total net revenue in the second quarter of $4.9 billion, a 2.4% decrease from prior year, but a 1.5% increase over the first quarter. The decline in revenue year-over-year was largely driven by lower Mortgage Banking revenue and net interest income. While the favorable linked quarter variance reflected strong seasonal fee revenue trends led by payments, partially offset by a decrease in net interest income.","Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 6. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $11 billion, or 5.2% year-over-year, and 1.2% linked quarter, accelerating from the 1% linked quarter we experienced in the first quarter. Overall, and excluding covered loans, which is a run-off portfolio, average total loans grew by 7.2% year-over-year and 1.6% linked quarter.","Once again, the increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average commercial loans, which grew by 11.2% year-over-year and 2.2% over the prior quarter.","Total average Commercial Real Estate also increased over the prior quarters, with average construction loans growing by 9.9% year-over-year and 4.9% linked quarter.","Residential real estate loans also continued to show a strong growth, 19.7% over the same quarter of last year and 3.9% over the prior quarter. Within the retail loan categories, average credit card loan outstandings fell slightly as consumers paid down their balances. And average home equity lines and loans continue to decline, as paydowns more than offset new loan originations. Auto loans and leases, however, posted a very good growth year-over-year and linked quarter.","We continue to originate and renew new loans and lines for our customers. New originations, excluding mortgage, plus new and renewed commitments, totaled approximately $48 billion in the second quarter, compared with $46 billion in the second quarter of last year and $36 billion last quarter. Total average revolving corporate and commercial commitments increased year-over-year by 10.2% and 2.2% on a linked quarter basis, while utilization remained flat at approximately 25%, close to where it's been for the past 6 quarters.","Given early industry indicators, our linked quarter average loan growth of 1.2% signifies that we are continuing to gain market share. Additionally, our current expectation is that linked quarter average loan growth will accelerate again in the third quarter to the higher end of our previously stated range of 1% to 1.5%.","Total average deposits increased by $16.1 billion, or 7%, over the same quarter of last year, and by $2.4 billion on a linked quarter basis, with growth in low-cost money market and savings deposits particularly strong on both a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis.","Turning to Slide 7 and credit quality. Total net charge-offs in the second quarter decreased by $41 million or 9.5% from the first quarter of 2013. While nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, decreased by $108 million or 5.3%. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding in the second quarter declined to 0.70% from 0.79% in the first quarter.","During the second quarter, we released $30 million of reserves, equal to the first quarter, and $20 million less than the second quarter of 2012. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we expect net charge-offs and nonperforming assets to remain relatively stable in the third quarter.","Andy will now give you a few more details about our second quarter results.","Andrew Cecere","Thanks, Richard. Slide 8 gives you a view of our second quarter 2013 results versus comparable time periods. Our diluted EPS of $0.76 was 7% higher than the second quarter 2012 and 4.1% higher than the prior quarter. The key drivers of the company's second quarter earnings are summarized on Slide 9.","The $69 million or 4.9% increase in net income year-over-year was the result of a decrease in expense and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by a decline in net revenue.","Net interest income declined year-over-year by $41 million or 1.5%, the result of a 2.7% increase in average earning assets, offset by a 15 basis point decline in net interest margin. The $8.2 billion growth in average earning assets year-over-year included increases in average total loans and the securities portfolio.","Offsetting a portion of the growth in those categories was a $3.1 billion reduction in average other earning assets, primarily due to the deconsolidation of a number of community development entities, and a $1.1 billion reduction in average loans held for sale, reflecting lower mortgage origination activity this quarter versus the same quarter of last year.","The net interest margin of 3.43% was 15 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2012, primarily due to lower-yielding investment securities and lower loan rates, partially offset by lower rates on deposits and wholesale funding, including long-term debt.","Noninterest income declined by 3.4% year-over-year, primarily due to Mortgage Banking revenue, reflecting lower origination and sales revenue, partially offset by higher servicing revenue and a favorable change in the addition to the mortgage rep and warranty repurchase reserve.","Also contributing to the decline in noninterest income year-over-year were reductions in corporate payments, the result of lower government and transportation-related transactions, and other income, which reflected fewer equity investment gains in the prior year and lower retail products revenue, primarily due to end-of-term lease valuations.","Offsetting these declines were year-over-year increases in trust and investment management fees, retail payments, merchant processing revenue, deposit service charges and investment product fees.","Noninterest expense was lower year-over-year by $44 million or 1.7%. The majority of this favorable variance is attributable to a favorable variance for professional services expense, primarily due to the reduction in third-party foreclosure settlement-related costs, as well as an accrual for a Visa-related settlement charge taken in the second quarter of last year, and lower intangible expense.","These favorable variances were partially offset by higher compensation and benefits expense and increases in marketing and technology expense.","Net income was higher on a linked quarter basis by $56 million or 3.9%, as a result of a 1.5% increase in revenue and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by a 3.5% increase in expense.","On a linked quarter basis, net interest income was lower, as average earning assets declined by $2.1 billion and net interest margin declined by 5 basis points. The decrease in average earning assets was a result of the reduction in other earning assets and loans held for sale, while the expected 5 basis point decline in net interest margin was primarily due to lower loans on rates and securities.","Given the current interest rate environment, we expect net interest margin to be relatively stable in the third quarter, which, combined with our expectation for a linked quarter loan growth, should lead to a modest increase in net interest income in the third quarter.","On a linked quarter basis, noninterest income was higher by $111 million or 5.1%. This favorable variance reflected seasonally higher payments and growth in all fee categories with the exception of Mortgage Banking revenue. In June, we had expected Mortgage Banking revenue to be higher in the second quarter than the first quarter, primarily due to very strong application volumes earlier in the quarter. However, since the time we made that statement to the end of the quarter, rates moved up by about 60 basis points and refinance activity slowed significantly. As a result, Mortgage Banking revenue actually came in slightly lower this quarter than last.","The $5 million decline in revenue reflected an increase in origination and sales revenue, including a favorable change in the reps and warranty reserve, offset by a lower gain on hedging activity than the prior quarter. Although applications were higher in the second quarter than the first quarter, the increase in volume was offset by a reduction in gain on sale margin. We calculate gain on sale margin based on applications expected to close.","On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense was higher by $87 million or 3.5%, mainly due to other expense, which include higher insurance and regulatory expense relative to the first quarter. In addition, marketing and business development expense and professional service expenses were higher in the current quarter versus the prior quarter due to the timing of business line projects and initiatives.","Turning to Slide 10. Our capital position remains strong and continues to grow. Based on our assessment of the final rules for the Basel III standardized approach released earlier this month, we estimate that our Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio at June 30 was 8.6%, compared with 8.3% calculated under the previously proposed rules. At 8.6%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement and above our targeted ratio of 8%.","Turning to Slide 11. In June, the Board of Directors declared an 18% increase in our common stock dividend. As a result, in the second quarter, we returned 73% of our earnings to shareholders. Dividends accounted for 30% of the return to shareholders and the 18 million shares of stock we repurchased in the second quarter accounted for the remaining 43%.","Of note, our tangible book value per share rose to $13.48 in the second quarter, which represented an 11% increase over the same quarter last year and a 1.6% increase over the prior quarter.","Finally, Slide 12 provides updated detail on the company's mortgage, repurchase-related expense and the reserve for expected losses on repurchases and make-whole payments. Rep and warranty's repurchase reserve was reduced this quarter by $43 million and the outstanding repurchase and make-whole request balance at June 30 was $64 million, compared with $66 million at March 31.","I'll now turn the call back to Richard.","Richard K. Davis","Thanks, Andy. Last Friday, Andy and I had the honor of commemorating the 150th anniversary of the signing of our national bank charter, by ringing the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange. We were joined on the stage by 10 U.S. Bank employees who proudly represented and celebrated the rich heritage that they and their coworkers, along with many who came before them, have helped to create and build over the past 150 years.","Importantly, as we took that moment to observe and reflect on our past, we also celebrate the present and the strong foundation upon which we are building our company's future. U.S. Bancorp posted record earnings for the second quarter, while once again achieving industry-leading profitability metrics.","We continue to build our future as we have in the past by investing in our well-diversified mix of businesses, by maintaining prudent risk management, by focusing on operating integrity and compliance, by sustaining strong capital and liquidity and by providing superior returns for our shareholders. As always, we remain focused on producing consistent, predictable and repeatable results for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our communities and our shareholders.","That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer questions from our audience.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR.","Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","This is Jessica Ribner for Paul. Just a question, I guess, on your Mortgage Banking expectations going forward. Are you looking for higher purchase volumes? Or do you see the same level of refis? I mean, we're part of the way through the third quarter, what's your outlook?","Andrew Cecere","So Jessica, let me tell you, first, from the perspective of what occurred in the second quarter. From a production standpoint, repurchase activity went from about 71% of the book in the first quarter to about 59% in the second quarter. And applications were also down about 10 points in terms of refinancing. I would expect that trend to continue. We do expect, again it's early in the quarter, but given the current rates there, I expect mortgage revenue will be down a bit, given the rates are today and we'll continue to update throughout the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko of SIG.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Looking at the sort of the slowdown in deposit -- average deposits growth, I'm wondering on your perspective, and maybe this is a broader question, around the whole loan demand question. But do you think that the banks generally are exhausting really what's out there from a deposit take? Or are we starting to maybe see -- maybe a little bit of cash being deployed on the deposit side into investment and business activities that could maybe possibly lead to an expansion of loan growth in the back half of the year? Just curious of your observations there.","Richard K. Davis","Jack, it's Richard. I think it's what you are predicting and it's what we've been saying for a long time, the first good movement we'll see on bank balance sheets is customers using their own deposits. And I'm happy to report, our deposits, while they were up, the number of customers with deposits was up as well. But the customers who already have deposits that are using some of those to, we think, employ them in some form of growth. After that, we would hope to see our lines of credit, especially in the wholesale side move from a utilization of 25% to anything -- 26% would be great. We used to be at like in the mid to high-30% utilization level. So there's a significant amount of pent-up opportunity and customers are paying for those lines to have them available and to keep them current. And then finally, there may be new lines and loans that will occur, particularly on the large end, when some transactions start to belie underlying growth. I will say, we do read it like you do. I think it's a positive that it's not growing anymore than that, as long as the number of customers are growing. And to follow our prior comments, I do think we're starting to see some of these green shoots that we mentioned 90 days ago, as being real and sustainable, and more green shoots. It's not a rush to a huge recovery, but it's absolutely and positively no longer a concern of going backwards. We're just seeing customers being thoughtful, careful. But one at a time, they're starting to get more comfortable about their future and they're starting to invest, starting with their deposits, sometimes getting lines of credit with the intent to use, and in many cases, starting to make decisions that have long-term outcomes for the long view of the economy.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Great. And then just the ratio of NCOs on the card book look like it walked up a little bit. I know in the Appendix you talked about lower recoveries, obviously, dollar amount down and the trend is good. Can you talk about what that means on the recovery side and what you meant by lower recoveries and how you're thinking about that going forward?","P. W. Parker","Yes, this is Bill. Part of that is really a timing thing as we brought more of the collection activities in-house on the recovery side. Not all of the recovery collection activities, but some of them. But as we do that, that delays the recognition of the recovery. But I don't expect it to have a material long-term impact, so it's really more of a timing issue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I just wanted -- on the fee side, I just wanted to ask you about just the payments businesses and specifically, in the corporates payments business is still having a bit of a tough revenue trajectory. Just wondering if you could specifically talk about that one, but also talk about just your outlook for the 3 payments businesses as we look ahead?","Richard K. Davis","The whole payments business is, 59% is our issuing business. And the 29% falls in -- 39% falls in the Elavon or merchant acquiring, and 10% falls in the corporate payment side in terms of revenue. And to start with your question, the corporate payments is about 1\/3 of that is government and that continues to be down 20% year-over-year, particularly based on government spending, probably some of the trickle effect of the sequester and certainly just the budget increase or decreases that have been evident on the federal side. But the rest of it continues to actually start showing some support again. The PCAR growth is up 13% over last year. We're starting to see a flattening and a stabilization of T&E for the first time, year-to-date. So on the corporate side, while it's 10% of the total, the government piece, which is 1\/3 of that, is still under some form of stress, but the rest is starting to show some positive trajectories. As it relates to the Elavon, which is our merchant acquiring, which also has a nice diversification of geographies, it's a global business, we're continuing to see growth in same-store sales that would reflect what you've seen in the statistics that both the federal government and some of the European government has said. So there's a nice second quarter lift there. We'll have pretty stable margins in terms of how we get paid. And we're actually quite encouraged by what we see on the Elavon side, both domestically and globally. And then finally, on the bigger part of it, the 59%, which is led by our issuing side, we're also seeing nice support there. As you know, the average net receivables or the outstandings were slightly down year-over-year, and that's particularly because people are just starting to have a higher payment activity and the payment rates were probably 1.5% higher than they were last quarters or last year, so people are starting to pay them off. But they're using the card. And so credit's been -- was up almost 3% year-over-year, following another 3% in quarter 1's growth. So we're seeing active accounts growing nicely. They're using their card more often. They have -- they're right now, they're paying them back more prudently. And at the end of the day, that will slow and they'll start to let that outstanding roll over and that will be another benefit. The credit card sales for us is 9% year-over-year absent the portfolio that we sold. And I couldn't be more optimistic about the payments business, as you see a nice trend in quarter 2, we should continue to see that growth.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then on the second question, just an expense question, an operating leverage question. On a -- at least, on an as-reported basis, we're looking at a little bit of a year-over-year decline in revenues, but a little bit of a year-over-year step up in cost, and you did call out the regulatory costs this quarter. So I just wanted to try to understand the balance between revenues, expenses and how do help us understand that regulatory cost, if it's now run rated or was that kind of a onetime catch-up?","Richard K. Davis","Good question. And I own that, good question because I tell you, we shoot for positive operating leverage every year. I think we are still very much in the game to be able to create positive operating leverage, even in the next couple of quarters, but it will be more challenging. And here's my real clear direction for you. As much as mortgages will probably be down, mortgage revenue, in the next couple of quarters, just based on the elements, and you know we're a heavy purchase shop, so our decrease might not be as significant as some of you reported. But I'm not going to take an expense reduction into important investments in the next quarter or two just to accommodate lower mortgage revenue until which time the middle of the curve starts to bend up. And if it does and the market starts to get stronger, then I think we'll be fine. So I'm not going to do any near-term adjustments just to appeal to a finally [ph] negative operating leverage if that's what it has to be, but we are going to continue to watch our expenses. The cost of compliance, as you recall, about a year ago, but in particular, the consent order, was almost $50 million a quarter, and that is trimmed down now to a substantially less, call it, $5 million to $10 million a quarter, as we wind down some of those mortgage-related activities. But I will tell you that we've continued to add compliance personnel and compliance protocols across the company to accommodate this higher requirement that we achieve near perfection on all of our operating activities. And so not all of that 50 is going to be given back. Most of it, however, though, Ken, is burned into the current run rate and you'll see it stabilize. I'm just a little concerned that mortgage might drop off more than I can accommodate in expense reduction dollar-per-dollar and we're not going to overachieve on that because I don't want to suffocate the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scinicariello of UBS.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones for you. Just curious to hear your take given the new -- the final capital rules that we got out there, and really my question to you is a little bit more big picture. I mean, do you feel that you guys kind of have a real competitive advantage versus some of your larger kind of brethren, given what we're seeing out of those rules?","Andrew Cecere","Well, the new rule effectively increased our cap ratio about 30%. Our binding constraints Tier 1 common under the standard -- 30 basis points, Tier 1 common under the Basel III standard. So last quarter, we were at 8.2%, using the same calculation, we would have been at 8.3% this quarter and the new calculation allowed us to get to 8.6%. 8.6% is about where -- above where we think we need to be. Our internal guideline is about 8%. And that is based on an assumed SIFI buffer of 50 basis points and an additional internal buffer of 50 basis points. So I think from a capital standpoint, we're in very good shape. We're not in a situation where we're trying to build capital to a level nor are we in a situation that we're overcapitalized and have no use for the capital. So when we're in a situation like we are today, where we're returning about 70% and reinvesting 30%, it allows us to reinvest at a level to accommodate the loan growth and earning asset growth that you're seeing. So we're in a really good spot. It allows us to make the investments we need to make, at the same time, allow for the growth that we are seeing right now.","Richard K. Davis","Yes, and just to put an exclamation point, Steve, we really like our position. We like our size, we like our simplicity, we like our diversification. As it relates to capital leverage and liquidity, we think we're substantially where we need to be before any fine-tuning that needs to occur. And I think all the rules that come out continue to remind us that being not a G-SIB is a positive outcome, but being big enough to matter. And being able to manage a very significant portfolio of a simple balance sheet allows us to be in a pretty good shape and we like the future we have.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Definitely, it looks you're in a real sweet spot going forward. And then the second question I had for you was just kind of in the same vein of kind of those investments for the future and you kind of touched on a little bit, talking about some of the expense initiatives going forward. Just kind of curious if there was any, maybe that you wanted to kind of flag for us just so we're aware, some of the things that you've got going on, some of the things you're investing in and maybe some of the timing of those things, how they might affect the expense line going forward?","Richard K. Davis","Yes, good question, Steve. A couple of things. One is we're going to continue to build our Wealth Management businesses. As you know, we started this trip 3 years ago. It was the one piece of the puzzle I didn't think U.S. Bank had sufficiently demonstrated leadership, and not only in our Wealth Management, but in our ultra-high net worth, under a brand called Ascent. We'll continue to open those offices. We're continuing to provide technology to our teams to create a unique experience and you'll see our continued expense initiatives in Wealth Management. Secondarily, you all know that we've just recently bought a company called FSV earlier this year in Florida, which is a prepaid card provider and processor. We continue to extend our position there. We now have no third-party partners in any part of prepaid because we have cradle-to-grave capability and a significant leadership position. I want to continue to add to that investment and build a stronger and a unique position of strength for prepaid as it adds to our card provision. And then finally, Corporate Trust, which you know we recently took across the pond and continue to see opportunities even outside of America to grow our Corporate Trust business. We've recently become more of a provider on hedge fund servicing and other areas by some recent acquisitions. There will be more where that came from. It could be both in the form of M&A or in the form of organic growth, but I'd say those 3 areas which are the 3 areas that continue to make us unique: payments, Corporate Trust and Special Wealth Management growth. I think those are areas you'd want us to invest in. They've got great trajectory now and I want continue that momentum so that when the world is better and ready to roll, we'll already be there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala of Bank of America.","Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just had a few follow-up questions and the first is on the dollar cost trajectory for the remaining of the year. Should we take out the $66 million in quarter-over-quarter increase in regulatory expense when we're thinking about the run rate for the third quarter? Or will some of that stay?","Andrew Cecere","What I would say, Erika, is the first quarter is seasonally low and then we had a little bit of a positive insurance recoveries and other expense. And I think the second quarter is more reflective of our run rate of expense with normal increases. So I would use second quarter as more of the basis for expense.","Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And the second follow-up question is you mentioned that mortgage revenues would be down just a bit. But we heard another large bank mention that they think if rates stay -- loan rates stay here, that the mortgage market is going to be down 30% to 40%. Is the message from U.S. Bank that you will outperform the market? And if that 30% to 40% decline is correct, where are you in terms of your outperformance relative to that number, just in proportion?","Andrew Cecere","Right. So first, Erika, as you know, mortgage application, or gain-on-sale revenue is one component of mortgage revenue. There are other puts and takes, including servicing revenue, the net hedge and so forth. So my expectation is not have our mortgage revenue decline to the level you just described. It's going to be less than that, but I do think it will go down. Application volume is a component of that, but there are a lot of gives and takes. And again, we'll update as we see more throughout the quarter, but I do expect mortgage revenue to be down a little bit, principally due to the gain on sale, principally due to applications, but there are some offsets.","Richard K. Davis","And Erika, it's Richard. It will be down unless rates were to turn. This thing turns so fast. We'd be crazy to try to predict the next 10 weeks when we can't see it that far. But we also have a -- always had a focus on purchase. So it's coming our way as a real base to what we're being good at and what we're focusing our market reputation on. And as you'll also remember, we never were as big on a HARP kind of a product, which is probably more likely to be one of the victims of increasing rates. And we didn't rely on that a lot because we didn't have a portfolio that allowed us to have much to refi. So in some cases, we probably should do better than average, but it will definitely be down and we're projecting the second half of the year to be less than the first half.","Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And just one more follow-up, Richard, it was loud and clear as you answered Ken's question on taking out expenses near term to accommodate some of the swings in mortgage revenue. I guess, no matter what, we should just look to your consolidated guidance of 50% on the efficiency side as we think about the puts and takes of --","Richard K. Davis","Yes, that's a really good way to think of it because we never set that target, it's always a result. But I can tell you that low-50s and where we have been forever. And especially in the last few years, by quarter, that should not change materially. That we will protect that. And I can tell you, I know we can because mortgage isn't the only thing that's growing around here and it will just be one of the components we'll keep an eye on. So I'm glad you heard me, because I don't want to be dollar-for-dollar and be shortsighted. We've been working for 5 years to grow a substantial amount of momentum and become a revenue company, not an expense company, and I'd hate to slow that down this last stage and we're going to be very protective of it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to drill into a couple of business lines. One is the merchant acquiring business that you have, and I know that you've invested globally there. We had some news the other night from the FT that suggested that the European Commission is proposing some changes on interchange in Europe, which I know many people have been thinking about. One of the elements they are supposed to be considering supposedly is separating out payments issuers from processors. And I'm wondering what that does to your merchant acquiring business in Europe, is it something that would be an opportunity for you?","Richard K. Davis","Yes. It's definitely not a concern based on what we've read, like you have. We're entirely an acquirer, not an issuer, and a processor. So the issuers are where that is, the gun sights are pointed in that topic. And as you said, there is an opportunity for us, particularly given our close-loop capability in our own proprietary product, that we believe this could be a net positive for us as a leading acquirer and processor. So we don't see it as a negative. We're trying to understand whether it's a positive, but we're not worried about it.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then separately in auto, could you give us a sense as to what exactly happened in auto? And what kind of reinvestment in the business you're doing now? And then a little bit on opportunity for share gain from here and what would drive that?","P. W. Parker","Betsy, this is Bill. Yes, we had a strong auto quarter, both loans and leases. And we anticipate that to be a strong third quarter, too. We obviously can monitor the new car sales. So we get a good sense of what our market share is, and in the second quarter, we definitely grew market share. It's a competitive space, but we've made the right investments to be successful there. We've been in the business a long time and we're very good at it.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right. And there's been some discussion around how the CFPB has come into the mix here, requiring the dealer rebates be done in a potentially a different way. And I know you've updated The Street on how you're thinking about it, but has your thoughts changed at all since your last update?","P. W. Parker","No. When that came out, we took action immediately, and narrowed the amount of dealer reserve discretion. We had no negative consequences to that. I think our dealers all understood it. We worked with them and we've seen increase in volume since then.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So no competitive reaction against what you did?","P. W. Parker","A couple of other banks followed us, yes.","Richard K. Davis","A couple of banks followed us, but it didn't hurt our volume and we're actually feeling that we've green fenced [ph] a little bit of the risk. The real issue here, Betsy, as you know, is going to be, if the banks as an entity can compete effectively with the captives who are not part of the CFPB's oversight, and that's a long time to be determined. And as it relates to our position against both of those entities, we're growing market share and we like the business, so we're going to continue to find ways to expand, not only in geographies, but also in product types that are start to emerge as rates start to go up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker of Compass Point.","Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","I just would like to discuss some of the increase in Commercial Real Estate loans this quarter compared to what's happened over the last year. You definitely saw a pickup from the first quarter and we're starting to see just broad growth across from the Fed data. Is there any particular sectors where you're seeing Commercial Real Estate pick up or any particular regions where you're seeing that?","P. W. Parker","Yes, I can speak to that. This is Bill. We've seen -- for several quarters now, we've seen multifamily being kind of the lead property class for demand. And for us, we've seen good new construction activity in Seattle, both Bay Area and Southern California, and then Houston. Those have been the primary areas for us. In other areas, we have seen some hotel\/motel lodging demand that's picked up a little bit. That's strong pretty much in all the coastal cities. So those are the primary areas that we've seen Commercial Real Estate growth.","Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then concerning residential real estate, given that the 30-year has moved up so much and you're seeing a decline in application volume for conforming 30-year fixed mortgages, are you seeing any application shift towards 5\/1 ARMs or 15-year fixed, given the move-in [ph] rates? Or is that -- you're also seeing a similar decline as you are for 30-year fixed?","Andrew Cecere","This is Andy. There's a bit of a shift to more of a shorter duration, as you described, and a little bit perhaps more on the variable rate. I will also tell you that, which we're putting on balance sheet, our Smart Refinance product has always been shorter in terms of the term there, closer to the 15-year. So the 30-year is not impacting that as much, and the decline is coming on the mortgage production in the 30-year, but there is some shift to shorter terms.","Richard K. Davis","I'd say here, as it turns out, I was surprised, but I thought there might be a bit of a tsunami effect or a cash-for-clunkers effect where we get a pent-up demand and anybody who still hadn't refi would come into the game now. And it doesn't seemed to have happened. I mean, it seems that people are still moving at kind of a snail's pace. So if they still see a deal that's better than the one they have, they'll come in. But we're not seeing that kind of onetime surprise that I thought we might have. That relates to mortgage. But until short-term interest rates start to move, we won't expect to see a great deal of effect on the commercial and wholesale side, although I do still predict there will be a bit of a rush to the gates when that starts to become a real thing. And we haven't seen that triggered yet and I think that will be an upper for wholesale lending at that moment in time, which could be a few quarters out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Werner of Morningstar.","Dan Werner - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Could you give us an update on the bank M&A environment in terms of what you're seeing. Are you still seeing the big gaps between sellers and buyers at this point, given that we've seen a lot of M&A activity amongst the smaller banks?","Richard K. Davis","Dan, we haven't seen any activity. I mean, I could pick it up, I wouldn't. But, I mean, I can make it sound interesting, but we haven't. We've had no approaches of any significance. We're not approaching anyone. Like you, I read about the small banks continuing to cobble together to find some critical mass, which makes total sense to me. Because the cost of compliance and just regulatory costs are easier by a larger base. But really, none. I mean, it couldn't be more dormant. And our interest couldn't be lower either. So I think as to an opportunity, we're not playing that indeed right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a follow-up on that. How about the payments business and the processing business, are you seeing more opportunities there?","Richard K. Davis","Yes, that actually, that feels a little more heated. Because, first of all, we're known to be an acquirer -- an active acquirer. We're known to -- we'll talk to anybody. I've said this before, but a few folks that created the great idea in a garage that's got payments unique that's attached to it, we'll talk to them. And some of the deals we look at are typically privately-held businesses. They're smaller than you would probably ever read about, but these are groups of people that either don't want to go out and raise the second round, the third round of capital and they want to be part of something bigger. In many cases, we can bring them in to be part of the company as well or sometimes they just sell and move on. But I would say, we have a very active list of M&A opportunities. Fewer as a percentage would come to the end, but it's not for a lack of having looked and seeing interest. And people know us, so they're coming at us.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, good. And then Andy, maybe a question for you. On your margin guidance, you talked about flattish for Q3. Is that something that's Q3-specific? Or is this more of a longer-term trend where maybe we're seeing we're near the end of the margin pressure for the company?","Andrew Cecere","Yes, Jon. So we talked about the fact that I expected the margin pressure to be worse in the first quarter, 5% in the second quarter and start to dissipate as we got in the second half of the year. So it's not a unique third quarter event. It's just a function of our reinvestment rates coming closer to our rates currently on the books, and currently rolling off. So we talked about that happening. It is happening, and we do expect the relative stability.","Richard K. Davis","Let me add one last -- we didn't get a question on it, so I'm going to create my own. Richard, what do you think about the growth of loan volume? We went from 1% linked quarter in quarter 1 to actually 1.25% in quarter 2. We have enough of a view to see that, that will go up in quarter 3. I don't know exactly how far because things -- we still have 10 weeks to go. But we are seeing -- here's how I would characterize it. Our flight-to-quality, which we've talked about for many quarters, many couple of years now, has become the real deal and it's certainly brought us a lot of good market share in the years going into this downturn. It's now becoming into a kind of phase 2 where we, we're invited into a lot of transactions and a lot of customers, at the depths of the recession, when they wanted a strong -- you know our highest ratings held [ph]. And now, they're rolling these over and we're getting invited back in at higher positions. We're invited in, in some cases, to lead transactions. And of course, the other business that comes with it is amazing. So for us to try to articulate why in a basically flat loan growth market we are growing now, and why we still think that can continue and in fact grow. I do think the secret sauce in U.S. Bank's business line is that we've got this flight-to-quality that's now turning into a -- we auditioned, we performed well, and now we're getting the lead part. And that's a really a good thing to see at this point and stage. And then as these commitments, we never talk enough about our commitments have continued to grow faster than our loans outstanding. And as you all, as analysts, know, the minute and if those actually get used, whoever has the line of credit has established themselves as the first among few to be the one to draw on, that's going to be the next round of loan growth, notwithstanding new customers. So we love our positioning there, we're actually fairly opportunistic and we're going to tell you that in an optimistic way to give you a sense that we see sustainability there.","Judith T.

Richard Davis, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's third quarter 2013 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules, are available on our website at usbank.com.","I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Richard.","Richard K. Davis","Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. I'll begin with a review of U.S. Bank's results with a summary of the third quarter's highlights on Page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bank recorded net income of $1.5 billion for the third quarter of 2013 or $0.76 per diluted common share. Total average loans grew year-over-year by 5.7% and 1.9%, or 7.6% annualized, on a linked-quarter basis. We experienced strong loan growth in total average -- strong growth in total average deposits of 5.5% over the prior year and 2%, or 8% annualized, over a linked-quarter basis.","Credit quality remained strong. Total net charge-offs decreased by 16.3% from the prior quarter, while total nonperforming assets declined, linked quarter, by 2.8%. We generated significant capital this quarter. Our estimated Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III rules issued in early July was 8.6% at September 30, while our Basel I Tier 1 common equity ratio was 9.3% and our Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.2%. We returned 77% of our earnings to our shareholders during the third quarter through dividends and the repurchase of over 17 million shares of common stock.","Slide 4 provides you with a 5-quarter history of our performance metrics, and they continue to be among the best in the industry. Return on average assets in the third quarter was 1.65%, and return on average common equity was 15.8%.","Moving to the graph on the right, you can see that this quarter's net interest margin was equal to the prior quarter at 3.43%. Our efficiency ratio for the third quarter was 52.4%, slightly higher than the previous quarter. As we have stated in the past, our goal is to maintain an efficiency ratio in the low 50s by continuing to manage expenses in relation to revenue trends and while continuing to invest in and grow our business.","Turning to Slide 5. The company reported total net revenue in the third quarter of $4.9 billion, a 5.6% decrease from the prior year and a 1.2% decrease from the second quarter. The decline in revenue year-over-year was largely driven by lower mortgage banking revenue, as well as decreases in net interest income and other income, which included a onetime gain in 2012. The linked-quarter variance in revenue also reflected the pullback in mortgage banking activity.","Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 6. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $12 billion or 5.7% year-over-year and 1.9% linked quarter, accelerating from the 1.2% linked quarter we experienced in the second quarter. Overall, excluding covered loans, a run-off portfolio, average total loans grew by 7.5% year-over-year and 2.2% linked quarter. Once again, the increase in average loans outstanding was supported by strong growth in average commercial loans, which grew by 10.9% year-over-year and 2.2% over the prior quarter. Total average commercial real estate also increased over the prior quarters, with average loans growing by 5.1% year-over-year and 1.6% linked quarter.","Residential real estate loans continued to show strong growth of 19.9% year-over-year and 4.8% over the prior quarter. Within the retail loan categories, average credit card loans and auto loans and leases were higher both year-over-year and linked quarter, while average home equity loans and lines continued, however, to decline as paydowns more than offset new loan originations. We continue to originate and renew loans and lines for our customers. New originations, excluding mortgage production, plus new and renewed commitments totaled approximately $47.9 billion in the third quarter, equal to the prior quarter and higher than the $45.1 billion originated in the third quarter of last year.","Total average revolving commercial and commercial real estate commitments continue to grow at a faster pace than loans, increasing year-over-year by 9.9% and 3.2% on a linked-quarter basis. Line utilization, however, edged down slightly again this quarter to approximately 24%. Given early industry indicators, our linked-quarter average loan growth of 1.9% signifies that we are continuing to gain market share. Our expectation is that linked-quarter average loan growth in the fourth quarter will once again be at the high end of our previously stated range of 1% to 1.5%.","Total average deposits increased by over $13 billion or 5.5% over the same quarter of last year and by $5 billion on a linked-quarter basis, with growth in low-cost interest checking, money market and savings deposits particularly strong on a year-over-year basis.","Turning to Slide 7 and credit quality. Total net charge-offs in the third quarter decreased by $64 million or 16.3% from the second quarter of 2013, while nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, decreased by $41 million or 2.1%. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding in the third quarter declined to 0.57% from 0.70% in the second quarter. During the third quarter, we released $30 million of reserves, equal to the second quarter and $20 million less than in the third quarter of 2012. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect net charge-offs and nonperforming assets to remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter.","Andy will now give you a few more details about our third quarter results.","Andrew Cecere","Thanks, Richard. Slide 8 gives you a view of our third quarter 2013 results versus comparable time periods. Our diluted EPS is $0.76, was 2.7% higher than the third quarter of 2012 and equal to the prior quarter.","The key drivers of the company's third quarter earnings are summarized on Slide 9. The $6 million or 0.4% decline in net income year-over-year was the result of a decline in net revenue, offset by a decrease in expense and a lower provision for credit losses. Net interest income declined year-over-year by $69 million or 2.5%, the result of a 2% increase in average earning assets, offset by a 16 basis point decrease in the net interest margin. The $6.1 billion growth in average earning assets year-over-year included increases in average total loans and investment securities. Offsetting a portion of the growth in these categories was a $5.4 billion reduction in average other earning assets primarily due to the deconsolidation of a number of community development entities in the second quarter and a $3.5 billion reduction in average loans held for sale, reflecting lower mortgage origination activity this quarter versus the same quarter of last year.","Net interest margin of 3.43% was 16 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2012 primarily due to lower rates in investment securities and loans, partially offset by lower rates in deposits and a reduction in higher-cost, long-term debt. Noninterest income declined by $219 million or 9.1% year-over-year primarily due to mortgage banking revenue, reflecting lower origination and sales revenue, partially offset by higher servicing-related revenue and a favorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights net of the hedge. Also contributing to the decline in noninterest income year-over-year was a reduction in other income, which largely reflected the 2012 gain from the sale of a credit card portfolio. Lower commercial products revenue and a reduction in corporate payments revenue, the result of lower government-related transaction, also contributed to the decline. As a reminder, corporate payments represents approximately 25% of our total payments revenue, and approximately 40% of the corporate payments revenue is government-related, while about 55% of the government revenue is related to defense spending. Defense spending was down about 19% year-over-year, an improvement over the second quarter's rate of decline, while the remaining portion of the government spend was essentially flat to last year.","A number of key categories helped to offset these unfavorable variances, including retail payments, merchant processing, trust and investment management fees and investment product fees. Noninterest expense declined year-over-year by $44 million or 1.7%. The majority of this favorable variance was the result of a decrease in professional service expense primarily due to the reduction in third-party foreclosure settlement-related costs. In addition, compensation and marketing expenses declined year-over-year. These favorable variances were partially offset by higher benefits expense, primarily pension-related, and higher costs associated with our tax-advantaged investments.","Net income was lower on a linked-quarter basis by $16 million or 1.1% as a result of a 1.2% decrease in revenue and a slight increase in expense, partially offset by lower provision for credit losses. On a linked-quarter basis, net interest income was higher as average earning assets increased by $3.1 billion and net interest margin came in, as expected, stable to the second quarter at 3.43%. The increase in average earning assets was the result of a growth in loans and securities, partially offset by a reduction in average loans held for sale.","On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest income was lower by $99 million or 4.3%. Again, this unfavorable variance primarily reflected the decline in mortgage banking revenue, as well as other income, which was lower, linked quarter, as a result of reduced equity investment income, retail lease revenue and a small merchant processing gain recorded in the second quarter. Partially offsetting the decline in these revenue categories was an increase in deposit service charges and seasonally higher corporate payments revenue.","On a linked-quarter basis, noninterest expense was essentially flat, up by just 0.3% largely due to other expense, which included higher costs related to tax-advantaged investments.","Turning to Slide 10. Our capital position is strong and continues to grow. Based on our assessment of the final rules of the Basel III standardized approach released in July, we estimate that our Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio at September 30 was 8.6%, equal to the ratio at June 30. At 8.6%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement and above our targeted ratio of 8%.","In the third quarter, we returned 30% of our earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends and 40% -- 47% through the repurchase of over 17 million shares of stock for a total return of 77%. Of note, our tangible book value per share rose to $13.82 at September 30, representing an 8.4% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 2.5% increase over the prior quarter.","Finally, Slide 11 provides updated detail on the company's mortgage repurchase-related expense and a reserve for expected losses on repurchases and make-whole payments. The rep and warranties repurchase reserve was $176 million at September 30, while the outstanding repurchase and make-whole request balances at September 30 was $114 million. I'll now turn the call back to Richard.","Richard K. Davis","Thanks, Andy. And turning to Slide 12. In September, we hosted our 2013 Investor Day in New York City. The theme of this year's conference was Extending the Advantage, which followed our 2010 Investor Day theme of Positioned to Win. During the presentations, our senior management team spent time reviewing what we accomplished since 2010, which included our added distribution and sale; our expanded products, services and capabilities; and our gains in market share, as well as how we positioned the company to capitalize on future growth opportunities. In other words, how we are extending the sustainable, competitive advantage that our company has created through carefully investing in our diversified business model by maintaining prudent risk management, by focusing on operating integrity and compliance, by sustaining strong capital and liquidity and by providing superior returns for our shareholders. U.S. Bank's performance metrics for the third quarter will, once again, be among the best in the industry. We will continue to build our company to perform in the future as we have in the past and remain focused on producing consistent, predictable and repeatable results for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our communities and our shareholders.","That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer questions from our audience.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question goes with the theme of Extending the Advantage. As I'm sure you're aware, larger banks or banks just larger than you have to comply with these new supplementary leverage ratio rules. And particularly, as it relates to the 100% capital that they have to hold against unfunded lending commitments, do you think that could be an opportunity for a bank with your scale and size if the SLR does pass as proposed?","Andrew Cecere","Erika, this is Andy. While we're not bound by that supplementary ratio, our ratio, in fact, would be above the 6% that we currently have. So it is -- given the simple structure of our balance sheet and the fact that most of our deposits -- or most of our funding is deposit-oriented, it is not a major factor for us. And so to that extent, it could be an advantage.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And just a question on your Basel III disclosure. Could you give us what your Basel III Tier 1 common would be under the advanced approach?","Andrew Cecere","It's interesting. We have a situation where our standardized approach is a lower ratio than our advanced approach. Said another way, standardized is our binding constraint because the advantage that we get from our simple, high-quality credit portfolio is more than the negative we get from increasing of our capital due to operational risk. So our capital ratio actually would be higher under the advanced approach. Therefore, our return would be actually a little bit better.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Richard, I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on your expectations for keeping the loan growth rate about the same pace and help us think about the constitution of it. It seemed like this quarter, you had resi mortgage pick up the slack a little bit. And so I'm just wondering what you're seeing in terms of people's appetite out there but also your appetite for retaining certain types of loan production.","Richard K. Davis","Yes, thanks, Ken. Mortgage had a strong quarter, and it's actually across the board. We were very pleased especially in some of the auto and consumer areas that have, in the last couple of quarters, not had this kind of lift. So I like the way it came about this quarter, which gives me confidence to say that we'll still be in that 1% to 1.5% range and probably in the high end of that, unless something occurs that we all know about in Washington that precludes a lot of things. In that case, I'll tell you we've got some opportunities for continued growth because of the following. In the last couple of years, U.S. Bank continues to be invited into more syndicated deals and in a higher position, by far, than we used to be in, in some cases, at the lead position. And that's a big turnaround from what we might used to have expected a few years ago. And likewise, as you know, one of the biggest sources of lending right now in line of benefits are refinancing and customers restriking their balance sheet. And so when they come up to that renewal point and we get invited into deals we weren't before or get invited to upsize into deals we've been in, that's a big driver for us. And that continues to happen at higher levels and expected to continue to happen even more so in the next couple of quarters. I might add that we're a flight to quality bank, so even when there's any kind of question in the economy about what might be otherwise negative, we tend to get the benefits that accrue to that on the lending side, as well as on the deposit gathering side, where you might expect people to come for that safety. The other thing, Ken, is that besides that, we're adding a lot of new customers. We've been talking about it for years. We really are, honest to God, adding new customers. And I've always struggled to explain that market share, after a while, it does, I think, continue to be real when it's consistently repeatable, and it's happening for us. And I think the number of new customers are at more substantial levels than they might used to have been because we get invited in as the lead bank or at a substantial position. So I think everything we have is repeatable and sustainable. That's why I'm quite confident. The market itself is not growing naturally, so I think it has to be market share. And finally, we're doing it on price. If we need to be competitive, our cost of funding is advantaged over every single other bank we compete with. We're not afraid to use a little bit of that, but I'll also tell you we will not go into structure. We will not take risk on underwriting, and we're not going to be in harm's way in some of those areas that I think the OCC, particularly, is going to be watching closely.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And my second question, Andy, you had been talking about getting to this point of margin stability, and we certainly saw that pickup in the investment securities yield. So I'm just wondering how you see the different parts in securities and then loans which are still trending down on a yields basis. How much -- how are you reinvesting, I guess, on the securities book? And then also, how close are we to the bottom of the loan yield side?","Andrew Cecere","Yes. So Ken, we're investing about half and half floaters and fixed on the security side. We're keeping the duration short, understanding that rates will go up. And we continue to maintain an asset sensitivity on our balance sheet. With regard to the loan side, I think we are seeing loan spread stabilize. There are certain pockets, particularly in the middle market and maybe on the smaller end, that we have some aggressive players that caused a little bit of a compression on spread. But as Richard mentioned, we have a funding advantage, so we could always compete on price. My expectation for the fourth quarter margin is relative stability again. However, I do want to note one item. With the government issues that we're facing, we are seeing an influx of deposits and quite a strong influx. And that -- while it doesn't impact net interest income, it does cause our net interest margin to go down a bit. So that could impact it by 1 basis point or 2. But absent that, I would see relative stability.","Richard K. Davis","[indiscernible] a flight to quality bank.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Dan Werner of Morningstar.","Dan Werner - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","This is kind of more of a forward-looking thing. On the corporate payments business and the government shutdown, could you comment on how that's impacted fourth quarter so far? And if that -- if those revenues are significantly lower, will they be made up once the government shutdown ends?","Richard K. Davis","Yes, I'll just go on quickly. As we try to characterize this particular earnings call, I think people might have thought we have a bigger position as the government affects our corporate payments. And I think you heard us walk through -- Andy walked through the percentage of the percentage of the percentage. By the way, that's only 20% of the total company's revenue. So it's really about a 1-ish kind of a percent impact to our total revenue, but it is an impact. And I'll tell you, it started out looking like sequester and a pull out of a war situation, and that's been the last, probably, 6 to 8 quarters. Right now, it looks like the continuation of the sequester and what continues to be now a government shutdown. Once and if those things get behind us, it will start to pick back up but not to the original levels until which time we get into a stronger purchasing pattern by some of the government agencies and well beyond whatever the sequester will end up to be. So I think this quarter will continue to be stressed for all the reasons we've been talking about, limited in Washington, and a little bit worse than they've been in the last few quarters. But once and when that gets past, then we expect this thing to start to pull back up, and we'll see a sustainable recovery as the government agencies start to spend, in particular, the Department of Defense gets it budget back and knows what its rules are going to be in the case going forward. Andy, do you want to...","Andrew Cecere","I think that's right, Richard.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Judy Murphy.","Judith T. Murphy","Thank you for listening to our call. Richard, do you have any...","Richard K. Davis","I just want to tell you guys that we are quite pleased with the follow-up we had from the Investor Day a couple of weeks ago. We do our very best to telegraph to you all exactly what is going on, and I think the results you read this morning were exactly what we suggested. We have a really good play at this company. We see the balance sheet continuing to grow. We have good margin protection. We've got good compliance and operating integrity. And as you worry about surprises, I think in this case, sustainable, predictable, repeatable is working pretty well. And we're going to continue to deliver on those consistent methods that we have in the past. We're always available for questions, but we appreciate the following of our company.","Judith T.

Andy Cecere and Terry Dolan are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's second quarter results and to answer your questions. Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. ","I'd like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Andy.","Andrew Cecere","Thanks, Jen, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry and I will take your questions. I'll begin on Slide 3. In the second quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.09. Despite our more challenging interest rate environment for the banking industry that has seen in some time, we delivered strong financial results supported by top line revenue growth and positive operating leverage of 1%. Loan and deposit trends improved compared with the first quarter, and we saw a broad-based momentum across our key businesses driven by account and volume growth. Credit quality remained stable, and we continue to prudently manage operating expense, while appropriately investing for the future. ","Turning to capital management. Our book value per share increased by 9.7% from a year ago. During the quarter, we returned 79% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. In June, we received the results of our CCAR submission, and the Federal Reserve did not object to our capital plan, which included a dividend increase of 13.5%. ","Slide 4 provides key performance metrics. In the second quarter, we delivered a return on average common equity of 15% and a return on average assets of 1.55%. Our return on tangible common equity was 19.2%. Our efficiency ratio improved both on a linked-quarter and year-over-year basis. Now let me turn the call over to Terry who'll provide more detail on the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance.","Terrance Dolan","Thanks, Andy. If you turn to Slide 5, I'll start with the balance sheet review and follow-up with the discussion of second quarter earnings trends. Average loans grew 1.1% on a linked-quarter basis and increased 4.5% year-over-year, excluding the fourth quarter 2018 sale of FDIC-covered loans that had reached the end of the loss coverage period. Solid year-over-year growth in mortgages, credit cards and installment loans supported solid consumer loan trends, while commercial loan growth reflected strength in both large corporate and middle-market lending, partly offset by paydowns related to active capital markets. ","New business pipelines remained healthy, although paydown activity is likely to remain elevated and choppy near term. Commercial Real Estate loans decreased on a sequential and a year-over-year basis. This quarter, Commercial Real Estate contribute a 20 basis point drag to linked-quarter average loan growth and an 80 basis point drag to year-over-year average loan growth. ","Given what we consider to be unfavorable risk\/reward dynamics in certain areas of Commercial Real Estate lending, we expect paydown pressure to continue to restrict growth in this portfolio. ","Turning to Slide 6. Deposits increased 2.9% on a linked-quarter basis and 3.1% year-over-year. Compared with the prior year period, growth in consumer wealth management and corporate trust balances was offset by lower Corporate and Commercial customer balances. Balances continued to migrate to higher yielding savings and time deposits from noninterest-bearing deposits. The decline in Corporate and Commercial banking balances were also affected in part by migration related to the business merger of a large financial client. This migration has stabilized and will be less impactful in future quarters. ","Slide 7 indicates that credit quality was relatively stable in the second quarter. Nonperforming assets decreased 5.2% versus the first quarter and were down 12.6% in the same period a year ago. Commercial loan 90-day delinquencies were elevated this quarter as a result of an administrative matter related to a single customer and is expected to be resolved in the third quarter without a credit loss. ","Slide 8 highlights the second quarter earnings results. We reported earnings of $1.09 per share in the second quarter of 2019 compared with earnings per share of $1.02 a year ago. Turning to Slide 9. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis grew by 1.4% compared with first quarter and increased by 3.3% year-over-year, which was in line with our expectations. Both linked quarter and year-over-year comparisons benefited from loan growth, offset by the impact of a flatter yield curve. ","Linked quarter growth also reflected an additional day in the quarter and higher interest recoveries. Slide 10 highlights trends in noninterest income. On a year-over-year basis, we saw mid-single-digit growth in credit and debit card revenue, corporate payments revenue and merchant processing revenue driven by higher sales volume in each category. Trust and investment management fees grew 3.5% due to business growth and favorable market conditions. And 6.4% growth in commercial product revenue was driven by higher corporate bond fees and trading revenue partly offset by lower syndication fees. ","Mortgage origination revenue decreased on a year-over-year basis. Strong origination and sales volumes were offset by an unfavorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights, net of the hedging activity. The year-over-year decline in deposit service charges reflected the impact of the sale of our third-party ATM servicing business in the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in other income was partly driven by the inclusion of the related transition services revenue from this sale, which will decline over time as well as higher tax credit syndications and equity investment revenue. ","Turning to Slide 11. The year-over-year increase in noninterest expense reflected higher personnel costs and professional services and technology expense tied to business growth initiatives. This was partially -- partly offset by a decrease in other expense primarily reflecting lower costs related to tax-advantaged projects and lower FDIC assessment costs. ","Slide 12 highlights our capital position. At June 30, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, estimated using the Basel III Standardized approach, was 9.5%. This compares to our target of 8.5%. I will now provide some forward-looking guidance. For the third quarter, we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to increase in the low single digits on a year-over-year basis. We expect fee revenue to increase in the mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage of 100 to 150 basis points for the full year 2019, in line with our previous guidance. ","We continue to expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 20% on a full year basis. Credit quality in the third quarter is expected to remain relatively stable compared with the second quarter. Loan loss provision expense growth will continue to be reflective of loan growth. Now I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks","Andrew Cecere","Thanks, Terry. The U.S. economy remains healthy, the jobs market is robust and the business and consumer confidence remains supportive of favorable consumer spending, parent as well as related business investment. While the flattening yield curve has created a more challenging interest rate environment, our core deposit franchise, interest deposit mix and consistent risk management philosophy puts us in a strong relative position from which we will navigate. Fundamental transient needs for our major key businesses are healthy and importantly, are being fueled by growth in new accounts and expansion of existing relationships, which in turn is driving strong volume growth. ","Our loan growth came in a little better than we had anticipated in the second quarter, and we are confident in our ability to win market share across our consumer as well as commercial portfolios. ","We are investing in the future with digital initiatives a key focus. As you can see on Slide 13, loan sales are being increasingly sourced through our digital channels. We expect this trend to continue with the expected outcome a better customer experience, higher account and volume growth and improved operational efficiency. The success of our digital mortgage program continues to meet or exceed our expectations. Currently, over 80% of all mortgage loan applications are completed digitally. ","Small business lending is another area where meaningful digital migration is occurring. As a reminder, last fall we launched a portal that allows small business customers to apply for and fund a loan up to $250,000 entirely, digitally and [indiscernible] consumer reaction has been extremely positive. In June, about 25% of applications for loans of this size used our digital portal. And year-to-date, book loan volume in this category is up 7% versus the same period a year ago. To summarize, the second quarter came in as we expected, and we are well positioned as we head into the second half of the year. I'd like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication, which drove these results. That concludes our formal remarks. We will now open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew O'Connor","I'm sorry if I missed this, we've just been jumping around here. But the margin was a little more resilient this quarter than I would have thought, given some of the growth and things like securities and other earning assets, but basically lower-yielding asset bucket. So even though the NIM was in line with what you guys had said, it just seemed a little more resilient and was wondering what drove that and then if you gave any NIM outlook.","Terrance Dolan","Yes. This is Terry. So I think part of that resiliency is just loan growth and where we end up seeing so that -- kind of a mix of loan growth. I think that was one of the major drivers. The -- we continue to have a little bit of accretion with respect to the investment portfolio and of course, the change in yield curve came very late in the quarter. So I think there's just a number of drivers like that. Then the -- if you think about net interest margin, our outlook, if you think about for the third quarter, our current forecast assumes a 2-rate decline for the rest of 2019, one in the end of July and one in September. And the long end of the curve staying essentially kind of where it. And as a result of that, we're going to see some pressure with respect to net interest margin during the second half of the year, okay? When we think about the margin, our expectation is, it is going to decline in the high single digits in the third quarter, and there are two reasons for that: the first one has really no impact on net interest income. ","And let me talk a little bit about that. So while half of the impact is due to a change in the regulatory -- in a European regulatory policy that has the effect of restricting our ability to include these balances in the LCR ratio. It is an industry-wide policy change by the European regulatory agencies, but because LCR is a binding constraint for us, we will have to increase our liquidity position by purchasing HQLA securities and funding this growth through borrowings that'll have similar sort of rates. So earning assets will grow, and that will offset the impact of about half of the change in net interest margin. The other half of net interest margin will decline because -- directly related to our expectation of the decline in rate as well as where the long-term yields are right now.","Andrew Cecere","So good summary, Terry. And just to reiterate about half of that decline in net interest margin is not impactful at all to net interest income. It's just a little higher asset offset by a little lower rate due to that regulatory change that you talked about. And I think when we're all set and done that we expect on a year-over-year basis, net interest income to be up in that very low single digit range given the rate declines that we expect here, and as Terry talked about, in the second half of the year.","Matthew O'Connor","Okay. And I mean there's obviously, some moving pieces on rates between here and the October call, but I just -- as we think about, say, the fourth quarter NIM, the impact of building liquidity is that could be fully in the run rate in 3Q? Or is there going to be kind of a stop impact of that in 4Q? And then should we think about a similar kind of core decline in the NIM in the 4Q if we get another rate cut in September?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. So let me answer the first question first. So on the fourth quarter related to the build in liquidity, that will be fully in the run rate because it really becomes effective for us July 1. So we are already kind of executing against that. So that'll be fully in the run rate. As we think about the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter, we will -- in the third quarter we will see -- we expect to see a rate cut at the end of July and then in September. And so that -- obviously, assets will start to price down immediately and deposit will -- deposit pricing will kind of come down over time. So I would expect that in the fourth quarter, you're going to continue to see more pressure with respect to net interest margin, and that's just kind of the dynamics of the balance sheet.","Matthew O'Connor","Okay just last one to squeeze in. Some banks are also giving guidance that if rates stay kind of stable -- if rates are stable, the NIM ex the liquidity. Is that kind of flat to down just a little bit? Or would you comment on more of a stable rate environment as well? And I'm done.","Terrance Dolan","Stable to hear. Yes, I think that -- I mean essentially, again, we think about net interest income being relatively stable relative to where it is in the second quarter, relatively flat.","Operator","John Pancari with Evercore.","John Pancari","Given your outlook for two cuts before the end of the year, the -- how does that impact your expectation for expense growth at all? Does that impact how you're thinking about expenses? I know you had expected full year expenses to be flat to up 1% or so for the full year '19. And then also, I know you saw a little bit of pressure this quarter on expenses. So curious how that growth expectation has changed. And then separately, about operating leverage as you look for 2020, how are you thinking about that?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. So John, again, this is Terry. So when we think about the second half of the year, clearly there's going to be pressure on net interest income, but one of the things I think we're seeing is good momentum on the fee income side of the equation, which I think will help to offset some of that, at least a fair amount of that. So if you think about it, we are seeing acceleration or momentum growing in our payments businesses. The consumer spend issues that were occurring in the early half of the year, they really kind of normalized. You -- we're seeing good momentum with respect to our mortgage banking revenue, and while it was down about 1 percentage point year-over-year this quarter, we would expect that to have hit that inflection point and start to grow in the third quarter. I think that, that will help. We're seeing good momentum, continuing momentum, with respect to trust and investment securities, and I think with the decline in the rate environment, I think you'll see more fund formation, I think in the third quarter with respect to corporate trust. So my point is that when you look across all of our fee categories, we see some pretty nice strength in that. I think that's kind of one of the benefits of our business model. And the diversification that we have on the revenue side of the equation is that fee income tends to help offset some of that pressure on the net interest margin side of the question. Andy?","Andrew Cecere","And John, specifically to your question, we'll continue to manage expense reflective of the revenue environment. And we still continue to expect that full year operating leverage in that 1% to 1.5%. The revenues [indiscernible] will be at the lower end of that range.","John Pancari","Got it, that's helpful. And if -- just one other follow-up. How would you think about operating leverage for 2020? I'm assuming obviously that's still very much part of it. But again, we could get a tougher backdrop as we go from the top line. So how do you think about what's attainable in 2020?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. So our goal, I think, in 2020 continues to be that 100 to 150 basis points. We'll end up having to manage through the rate environment, of course, making decisions short term versus long-term investments that we end up needing to make. But as we think about 2020, we'll continue to have that as our goal that we expect to achieve. Where we might have saw more expansion in a -- based upon what conditions were at the beginning of this year, that may continue to stay more at the lower end of the range. But we'll have to just see how revenues develop.","Operator","John McDonald with Autonomous Research.","John McDonald","I wanted to follow up on John's question, Terry. For the operating leverage for this year, you came in the first half of the year towards the lower end of the 1%. Just kind of wondering, I think you mentioned some things that get better in the second half, what are the puts and takes towards maybe we're getting to the middle of the range in the second half of the year, maybe closer to the 1.5%?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. I think for us -- I mean in the second half of the year -- again, I think just given the revenue environment on the net interest income side of the equation, that, that will be harder to achieve. But again, I think it depends upon how strong the fee income growth is as we go into the second half of the year. And again, we're seeing nice acceleration with respect to our payments and our mortgage banking businesses, et cetera. So that's going to be kind of the wildcard there.","Andrew Cecere","And then, John, this is Andy. On the expense side of the equation importantly, we continue to invest in a number of our technology and digital initiatives, while at the same time optimizing the current business structure, and I think that put and take of those 2 things will drive the expense growth to the low side, so that we're managing consistent with the revenue environment.","John McDonald","Okay. And then just a follow-up on some of the NII questions, Terry. Is there a way to size how much 125 basis point cut hurts in terms of NII or NIM, everything else equal?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. So if you think of -- and again, you can kind of do the math based upon some of our asset liability disclosures, but 25 basis point cut on a short end only probably has a $40 million to $45 million sort of impact to us. So that's kind of how we dimension it. And then the -- if you end up looking at kind of on a shock basis I guess, if you will, that would be $80 million to $90 million of the cost of -- across the curve.","John McDonald","Okay. $80 million would be like a parallel?","Terrance Dolan","Yes.","John McDonald","Okay. And then just for the -- yes, so I guess that's the other point of it, like right now are the current investment yields where the long end is, are current reinvestment yields accretive, dilutive a kind of breakeven-ish?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. So our expectation, when we think about the third quarter, is that it certainly has come down in terms of the amount of accretion that you have. We still think there's opportunity for 20 to 25 basis points of accretion on the investment portfolio. I think in the short term though, we're going to see some pressure with respect to premium amortization that may offset that.","John McDonald","Okay. Got it. But those securities that you plan to put on in terms of the -- some of the pressure that you mentioned for the next quarter, are those kind of -- are you thinking of those as NII accretive?","Terrance Dolan","We're thinking of those as in terms of the liquidity position and the regulatory issue, specifically?","John McDonald","Yes.","Terrance Dolan","Yes. So we think that, that is -- that's neutral from a net interest income perspective.","John McDonald","Got it, got it. And a little bit hurtful to the NIM percent.","Terrance Dolan","Yes, it'll hurt NIM, but it'll be neutral with respect to net interest income.","Operator","Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","So just to make sure, I understand it's neutral for the coming quarter, but does it flip positive when premium amortization goes away?","Terrance Dolan","You mean in terms of the investment portfolio?","Betsy Graseck","Yes.","Terrance Dolan","Yes. And again, it kind of depends on what ends up happening with respect to yield curve. So if premium amortization starts to neutralize, it would have a little bit of a positive impact.","Betsy Graseck","Right. Okay. And then I wanted to just ask a little bit around the mortgage business. Obviously, strong quarter there. Can you give us a sense as to how you're thinking that plays out over the rest of the year? Does this quarter reflect the significant pickup in applications? And when you close, there's only a tail -- little tail left? Or do you feel like this will continue to ramp throughout the rest of the year?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. I think it continues to be beneficial through the rest of the year and it -- for a couple of different reasons. Some of the benefit is because of the refinance activity on the -- because of the change in the long end of the curve. But refinancings continue to be only about 30% of our overall volume. So a lot of that volume pickup for us, I think, is driven more by things like the investments we've made in our digital channel, the investments we've made in terms of the retail side of the channel versus the corresponding side of the equation. And the fact that -- because of that investment on the retail side of the equation, we've expected margins to start to improve. So we're going to see the benefit of higher margins because of that mix of business, but also on the purchase side of the equation, volumes have been very strong. So we expect the -- to see a pick up in the second half and start to continue.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then could you talk a little bit about consumer spending? And how that impacted you in the quarter?","Andrew Cecere","So Betsy, this is Andy. That's starting to come back. As we talked about late in 2018 into the first quarter of '19, that started to weaken a little bit. But we've seen sequential improvement in each month, and now it's closer to that 5%, 5.5%, 6% range which is still a little bit below early last year, but starting to get back to normal levels.","Terrance Dolan","And if you think about our payments base, that 5% and 5.5%, which Andy talked about, but on the merchant side that's closer to about 9%.","Andrew Cecere","Merchant acquiring volumes [indiscernible].","Terrance Dolan","Merchant acquiring volumes. And again, I think that is tied to some of the investments that we've been making in the business on the integrated software solutions, et cetera. And then the sales volumes on the corporate payment side of the equation continue to hold up. That's really more kind of in the 6% range, so it's lower than it was a year ago, but it's still quite strong. And those types of things give us some confidence with respect to where the economy is as well.","Betsy Graseck","That's interesting. Just linking that to Commercial loan growth, you had a nice pickup Q-on-Q. I know you mentioned that the forward look will have some impact from paydowns, and I guess the question I have here is, have you seen paydowns accelerate at all in 2Q?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. I would say that with respect to loan growth in the second quarter, not a lot of acceleration in terms of paydowns. We continue to see it in the Commercial Real Estate side of the equation. And so where we say that there's going to be pressure, I think it's really more in Commercial Real Estate. And I guess based upon where we're at in the economic cycle, I think we're fine with that. And those paydowns will come because of increased capital market, sort of, activity based upon where Commercial Real Estate developers can't refinance their projects. But if you -- when we think about kind of our outlook from a loan standpoint, again, I think consumer spending continues to be strong. GDP is holding up okay, unemployment is just fine. The -- we're seeing good growth in terms of the middle market space and really kind of across most regions in the country. So we just think that there's a lot of signs that would suggest that, that loan growth is going to continue, M&A activity pipeline, et cetera. So we feel fairly confident about where we're at right now.","Betsy Graseck","And just one last question for me on the middle-market side in those regions doing better. I'm wondering if you're seeing any particular industries accelerate because as we look at the macro data, we've had some pullback in some of the manufacturing area, trade, ag or transportation, I should say, agriculture. So one of the things that I've been getting from folks is, \"Hey, where's this strength in C&I coming from?\" I don't know if you have any things you can share with us on that.","Terrance Dolan","Yes. And again, on the middle-market side of the equation, it -- if you think about just kind of core commercial C&I, our growth was on a linked-quarter basis, 2-plus percent. I think it did -- there was a little bit of an offset or drag because of the agricultural lending that we have. And again, that's just kind of where the farming economy is at this particular point in time. We don't do a lot of land financing, our's is really tied more to farm operations, and the exposure to ag for us is really not that significant. So the -- I think manufacturing continues to hold up reasonably well. It may be a little bit lower than what it's been in the past, but for us, our middle-market business is pretty diversified across many different industries and across our entire footprint. So based upon what we're seeing right now, we would expect that to continue to hold.","Operator","Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Thank you so much for the detail on net interest margin sensitivity to rate cuts. I'm wondering if could give us some insight on how you're thinking about deposit repricing in terms of both lag and a magnitude of repricing relative to each 25 basis points?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. So again, just to kind of give a reminder. If you think about our deposit base, about half of it is retail and about half of it is corporate and trust. And the retail deposit betas in the movement up was fairly inelastic, so you didn't see a lot of moment with respect to deposit pricing there. But our corporate trust and our wholesale deposits tended to be much more sensitive, as you can imagine. So when you think about a declining rate environment, we believe that deposit betas are going to come down in the corporate trust world reasonably fast as rate cuts are occurring, but you're just not going to see as much with respect to retail.","Erika Najarian","Perfectly fair, but the betas in corporate and trust were I think higher than expected. So as I think about full year 2020, it seems like there's an opportunity for actually net interest margin either stability or accretion relative to 4Q '19 even in the face of rate cuts, if we assume rate pricing on just 50% of that book and assuming the curve stays where it is. Is that too optimistic of a conclusion?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. I think if you end up looking out to 2020 and you're assuming the rate cuts are occurring, I think that because of our mix of corporate trust and wholesale, that we, on a comparative basis, are going to perform pretty well. So that's going to be more sensitive and deposit price is going to come down more quickly in the [indiscernible].","Andrew Cecere","I think, Terry, what you said was the betas for corporate trust and wholesale will continue to be high if they come down, something like that.","Terrance Dolan","Yes. Absolutely, absolutely.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And I noticed that comp expenses rose only 2% year-over-year. It's -- it had been trending in the 8% to 9% range annually previously, and I'm wondering if this is really an -- the opportunity that always existed even despite the change in the rate environment. And I'm wondering as we think about those comp levels or the rate of growth of comp, is it between 2% to 8%? I mean how should we think about the slowdown of that pace of growth?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. So if you think about compensation of that 8% range, I mean that really was a period of time when we were building our risk and compliance in different areas with respect to investments in the business. So that was unusually high. And as we've said that kind of started to moderate in late 2017, certainly 2018. 2019 I think is kind of -- all of that has normalized. When I think about a 2% to 3% sort of compensation range, we certainly think that we can manage within that level for an extended period of time, and I think that will help us. Some of that compensation obviously, is tied to revenue, for example, in the capital market space or some of the wealth management areas. But -- so it'll be somewhat dependent upon what sort of revenue streams we see on the P side of the equation, but that would be a good thing.","Operator","Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth Usdin","So I'm just going to ask a couple of clean up ones. Can you help us understand the magnitude of the interest recoveries that came through the NIM this quarter relative to last?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. I mean, Ken, we always have interest recoveries that are occurring. I think the reason why we want to highlight that a bit is simply because we're at the -- at -- we're at the late end of the business cycle and just given where credit has been for an extended period of time, we just don't know whether or not that will continue. So it's more of just trying to highlight that a little bit because of where we're at in the business cycle.","Kenneth Usdin","Okay. So was it above normal? Or -- I mean that you always -- you have the -- was it above normal even?","Terrance Dolan","I would say it was kind of normalized, but maybe a little bit high given where we're at in the business cycle.","Kenneth Usdin","Got it. Okay. You mentioned in other, you had some elevated -- you've been successfully harvesting some gains, and do you see a lot of opportunities on that front, especially where we are in the equity cycle? Should that continue to also be relatively strong as far as the other income -- other fee income line is concerned?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. I mean other income includes a lot of different things. It includes tax indication revenues, it includes some of the transition revenue related to our ATM sales -- leading the sale of our ATM business. And that will continue through 2020, but it'll start to dissipate as we go through that conversion. On the equity investment side of the equation, we still think there's opportunity there.","Kenneth Usdin","Okay. And then last one, just as we get hopefully closer to the Feds making some of the rules finalized at some point on the tailoring front, can you just talk through where you're seeing or anticipating to be the potentially business opportunity sets? And can you get ahead of any those at all? Or do you have to wait till they get formalized?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. Certainly, from a capital management standpoint, there's going to be benefit because of the AOCI and then on the liquidity side that'll help us as well. We really -- we'll have to wait until -- or we're going to wait until we have clarity with respect to the adoption of that and then, kind of, make decisions, both with respect to capital management and LCR. We've talked about in the past that we think that there's the opportunity to bring down HQLA by that $10 billion to $15 billion range and either redeploy it or think about the investment security portfolio. On a capital management side, we're at 9.5% today. And once we have clarity around CECL and the tailoring rules, we would expect are managing that back down closer to the 8.5% target.","Operator","Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Marlin Mosby","Had one big strategic question and a very specific accounting question. We'll start with the accounting side. When you talked about premium amortization, you talked about maybe a headwind, you kind of said well there's some headwind coming. What I was curious about is most of the other calls we've actually heard management's talking about how they had accelerated. So I know you can, from an accounting standpoint, estimate amortization and so when rates move, you get kind of whipsawed around or you can kind of pay as you go. I was just curious in the sense of how you're amortizing that premium. Are you really more kind of a pay as you go or are you estimating what you think the rates are going to do to you?","Terrance Dolan","Well, we're certainly taking into consideration what we expect rates to do to premium amortization. I think the -- for us anyway, there is just a little bit of a lag. Most of the -- most significant change is that of occurring very late in June. And so I know the way that we end up accounting for it, it'll end up coming really more so through the third quarter than it was in the second quarter, just the way we end up accounting for it.","Marlin Mosby","So it's just a quarter lag more than anything else, and that's it?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. And again, that's assuming that the rate curve kind of stays where it is in terms of what the impact's going to be going forward.","Marlin Mosby","And that happens in the third quarter and then if rates stay where they're at, that's kind of behind you and you go into the fourth quarter's end with no impact in the since that rates don't change anymore?","Terrance Dolan","That's what we're hoping.","Marlin Mosby","All right. All right. And then the other thing I was trying to get at was merchant processing. You were talking about growth in the 8% or 9% when revenues are kind of growing in the 4% to 6%. How is the competitive environment for merchant processing? It seems like you've been picking some momentum back up there, but do you feel like you're going to be growing with kind of the same-store sales and maybe a little bit of market share gain? How do you envision that merchant processing as you're looking at the competitive environment right now?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. So certainly, the difference between the two is the churn that you have in the book of business. Our growth rate I do think that we'll -- from 4.5% or so will continue to accelerate as that new business comes on board. The other thing is that you have effects of foreign exchange and other things that are dampening that growth rate on the revenue side of the equation. So there's just a number of kind of dynamics. But when you think about the underlying business, we think it's accelerating, and we think it's strong.","Andrew Cecere","And I'd add, I think the team has done a terrific job of accelerating our greatest software vendor capabilities as well as our omnichannel capabilities and importantly, integrating with the other banking components so that we have a full set of products and capabilities that we can offer our middle-market and small business customers. So those activities are, I think, also driving the growth in a very positive way.","Operator","Antonio Chapa with UBS.","Saul Martinez","This is Saul Martinez at UBS. So a couple of questions. First of all, wanted to follow-up on Erika's question on the trajectory of deposit cost and fully get the difference between retail and corporate and trust deposits. But if I bring all of that together, how do we think about just the overall trajectory of your cost of interest-bearing deposits? Because historically, there's typically a sort of a 1- to 2-quarter lag between when cost of deposits start to decline and when the Fed starts to cut. So as we think about 3Q, 4Q, should you see an immediate benefit from, say, a July hike? Or -- I'm sorry, July cut? Or does it take a couple of quarters for that to start to filter in the 1.12% costs start -- interest-bearing cost to deposits starts to come down later in 2019 or 1Q? Or is it -- or should we start to see that all in 3Q?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. So let's take corporate trust or the wholesale side of the equation. That'll be fairly quick in terms of the July rate cut. Some of it is the timing of the fact that the July rate cut would probably happen at the end of the month. There's just opportunities for us to be able to incorporate that into our process, but -- so on the corporate trust side of the equation, it'll be pretty quick. But there is always a little bit of a lag in terms of it kind of getting incorporated in the process. So the benefit will be stronger in the fourth quarter certainly than in the third.","Saul Martinez","Right. In your guidance -- I mean are we assuming -- are you assuming that the overall cost deposit come in from 2Q levels?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. Yes.","Saul Martinez","Okay. Right, in 3Q. All right. Change gears a little bit, on your branch strategy. You've highlighted 10% to 15% branch reductions now over, I guess, a couple of years. On the surface, the 3,000 branches, that doesn't seem like a huge number. But it's about 300 to 450 if that's -- if I'm thinking about it right on 3,000 branches. And I think what you've said in the past is your community bank branches, which are like a little over 1,000 and in-store branches, which would take you cumulatively on those 2 to about 2,000, aren't really subject to being rationalized. So effectively, your Metro markets, you're cutting a huge amount of your existing branches in urban markets, if my logic is right. Something like 30% to 45% of your Metro markets. First -- so I guess my question is first, am I thinking about that right? Are the cuts going to be exclusively or almost exclusively in the Metro markets, which are like 1,000 branches? And what's driving this? Because it seems like a pretty substantial repositioning of your branch network?","Andrew Cecere","Yes. We have three sort of segments or branches, 1,000 in community, just under 1,000 in-store and outside and just over 1,000 in Metro. What we said is we're not going to exit communities. So we are not going to exit and have no branch standing in the community market we're currently in, but we do have some opportunity in community markets to rationalize or consolidate branches particularly, those that are close together, and that's also true for the in-store. So it is not only focused in Metro. The other thing I mentioned to you is that, that 10% to 15% is a net number. That includes optimization, moving 2 branches to a better location, entering new markets like we've announced in Charlotte, so forth. So that's a net number across all categories.","Saul Martinez","Okay. But should we assume that the vast majority of the branch rationalization occurs in Metro markets? Because even if there is some rationalization in community -- the community banking and in-store branches, it seems like -- especially considering that's a net number of branches you'll open in Charlotte, Atlanta, Dallas, whatever. It seems like a pretty big proportion of your existing branch network gets rationalized in urban markets.","Terrance Dolan","Yes. No. We're looking at optimization of our branch network. It's really across all 3 categories. We do believe that there's opportunity with respect to all categories. I mean think about community as an example, it includes some sizable markets like at the [indiscernible] or in Omaha, [indiscernible] et cetera, where we do have fairly significant branch networks. So it'll be across all of our -- we will tilt of the Metro markets, but it will include all markets.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. David Long with Raymond James.","David Long","You guys have -- I guess this is a follow-up to that last question, but talking about some of the areas where you're looking to add branches and just curious how the rate backdrop plays into how aggressive you are in pursuing that strategy?","Andrew Cecere","I don't think the rate backdrop is directly impactful to it. I think what we're trying to do is enter new markets where we already have a large employee base, a customer base that have 1 or 2 or 3 other products that, that U.S. Bank in their wallet, but don't have a full banking relationship and trying to extend that relationship using the data and things that would be valuable to that customer, regardless of the rate environment.","Terrance Dolan","Yes. And so it's about building the overall relationship with the customer and then when you think about it, I mean this is really a long-term strategy. So the current rate environment is only one consideration on data point.","David Long","Got it. And then second question I had was related to CECL and the impact that may have. Are you guys at a point where you can talk about what the impact may be on your overall reserve levels and also your appetite to make loans into certain categories?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. So yes -- and I think what we have talked about in the past is 20% to 40%. And in the third quarter, we'll be kind of going through a more substantive parallel run. And I think we'll have better insights with respect to the implications associated with that particular point in time. What -- we've said it's a range of probably 20% to 40% increase in the reserve, and I think we've even said that's kind of closer to that 30% sort of range, so you can kind of do the math. But we're probably going to wait until we get through that third quarter assessment. The other thing is I think we'll have better visibility with respect to what the economy will look like. And of course, that's certainly a driver in that process. As we've thought about the different products and what we'll emphasize or deemphasize, we're really making decisions more based upon the economics of the product profitability than we are allowing the accounting model to influence, that sort of a decision. So at this particular point in time, we haven't really said we're going to change that approach.","Operator","Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you guys give us some color -- obviously, payments is a very important part of your business model. And we've seen that the announcement on Libra and what they're going to try to do, have you guys read the white paper and can you give us your thoughts on what you think?","Andrew Cecere","We have read the white paper, and we've had a number of discussions on it. I think it's in the early stages, Gerard, so I don't think there's immediate impact, but we have a number of initiatives going out with our payments. We're trying to understand the impact, but not only that but really optimizing the new real time reals that have been built and are being used -- a number of used cases across the company. The migration of treasury management moving to corporate payments activities and the impact on the consumer side to all the real time activity that's occurring. So it is one component of a more substantial change that's occurring in the environment, which is around payments overall, which is very impactful and very much something we're focused on.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then coming back, over the years, obviously, you guys have been very successful in making depository acquisitions as well as other nondepository acquisitions. Can you give us your view on what you're thinking over the next maybe 12, 24 months on depository transactions as well as nondepository transactions? Are you interested or is that something that could happen if the right opportunities came up?","Andrew Cecere","Yes. So as you know, most of our recent transactions have been nondepository. They've been either current portfolio's payments capabilities, trust, things of that sort, technology capabilities. And I think that will continue to be a focus for us. As we talked about, we are working on entering new markets without an acquisition, but in it's concept of a digital-first branch-light strategy. So I think that is a new way to enter a market. It might be more efficiently and effectively without paying a big premium and having attrition that occurs after the back. So if we were looking at anything larger, and we'll look at all opportunities, it would have to be substantial, it would have to be meaningful. And we'd also have to wait that transaction against the great momentum that we have across the company right now across many of the businesses and think about it from a long-term perspective. So we'll consider all those things, but I wouldn't expect us to enter a new market with a small depository acquisition, given our other opportunities to do that.","Gerard Cassidy","And speaking of the other opportunities, Andy, can any early redid on that the digital strategy that you guys have launched into these markets or is it too early to tell? Or what are you guys seeing from the early results?","Andrew Cecere","It's just starting, Gerard. So we -- in fact, in the next month, we will have the first branch there and we'll -- the others are -- will come after that, so it's too early in the game to tell.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

[Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon, Eastern standard time, through Wednesday, January 23 at 12:00 midnight Eastern standard time.","I will now turn the conference call over to Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.","Judith T. Murphy","Thank you, Christie, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's fourth quarter and full year 2012 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules, are available on our website at usbank.com.","I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Richard.","Richard K. Davis","Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. 2012 was a great year for our company, and I'm very proud to share our fourth quarter and full year results with you this morning. I'd like to begin with a few full year highlights on Page 3 of the presentation.","U.S. Bancorp reported record net income of $5.6 billion, or $2.84 per diluted common share, for the year 2012. We achieved record total net revenue of $20.3 billion, which was higher than the previous year by 6.2%, driven by growth in both net interest income and fee revenue. We achieved industry-leading profitability, with a return on average assets of 1.65% and a return on average common equity of 16.2%, an efficiency ratio of 51.5%, and we realized positive operating leverage year-over-year. Average loans grew by 6.9% over 2011, and we experienced strong year-over-year average deposit growth of 10.6%.","Credit quality continued to improve, with a decline in net charge-offs of 26.2% and an 18.9% decrease in nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets. Our capital position ended the year stronger, with a Tier 1 common equity ratio of 9%, and we were able to return $3.4 billion of our 2012 earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.","Now turning to Slide 4 and our fourth quarter highlights. U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2012, or $0.72 per diluted common share. Included in the current quarter was an $80 million expense accrual for the recently announced mortgage foreclosure settlement, which reduced EPS by $0.03. Recall that the fourth quarter of 2011 included 2 notable items that increased EPS by $0.05.","Total net revenue of $5.1 billion was slightly higher than the same quarter of last year. Excluding the prior year merchant settlement gain, however, total net revenue grew by 5.6%. Importantly, we achieved positive operating leverage year-over-year.","Total average loans grew year-over-year by 6.4% and as expected, 1.5%, or 6% annualized linked quarter. We experienced strong loan growth -- strong growth in total average deposits of 9.2% over the prior year and 1.9% over the third quarter of 2012.","Credit quality continued to improve. Total net charge-offs decreased by $70 million, or 13% from the prior quarter. You may recall that the third quarter net charge-off included $54 million of incremental charge-offs related to a regulatory policy clarification. Nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, declined by 4.6% linked quarter. We generated significant capital this quarter and ended the quarter with a Basel I Tier 1 common equity ratio of 9% and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.8%. Our estimated Tier 1 common ratio under the most recent Basel III rules was 8.1%. We repurchased 13 million shares of common stock during the fourth quarter.","Trends in our industry-leading performance metrics are shown on Slide 5. Return on average assets in the fourth quarter was 1.62%, and return on average common equity was 15.6%. Both ratios declined from the prior quarter, primarily as a result of the mortgage foreclosure-related expense accrual. As a reminder, our company's long-term goal is to achieve a normalized ROA in the range of 1.6% to 1.9% and an ROE between 16% and 19%.","Our net interest margin and efficiency ratio are shown in the graph on the right-hand side of Slide 4. This quarter's net interest margin of 3.55% was 5 basis points lower than the same quarter of last year and as expected, 4 basis points lower than the prior quarter's rate of 3.59%. Andy will discuss the margin in more detail in a few minutes.","Our efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 52.6%, slightly better than the prior year but higher than the previous quarter, primarily reflecting the $80 million mortgage-related settlement expense accrual that was included in our current quarter's results. We continue to manage our operating expenses effectively and expect that this ratio will remain in the low-50s going forward, as we continue to invest and grow our businesses.","Turning to Slide 6. The company's reported total net revenue in the fourth quarter of $5.1 billion, a slight increase over the prior year's quarter and a 1.3% decrease from the previous quarter. As noted on the slide, the year-over-year increase in total net revenue would have been 5.6% excluding the impact of the fourth quarter of 2011 gain. The company's revenues benefited from continued growth in both our balance sheet and fee-based businesses, particularly mortgage, as we have significantly increased our market share over the past few years.","Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 7. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $13 billion, or 6.4% year-over-year. Overall, excluding covered loans of runoff portfolio, average total loans grew by 8.6% year-over-year and 2% linked quarter. Once again, the increase in average loans outstanding was led by a strong growth in average commercial loans, which grew by 18.4% year-over-year and 3.3% over the prior quarter.","Residential real estate loans also continued to show strong growth, 19% over the same quarter of last year and 5.3% over the prior quarter. Within the other retail loan category, home equity line and loans continued to decline on average, while auto loans and leases showed steady growth over both comparable periods.","We continue to originate and renew loans and lines for our customers. New originations, excluding mortgage production, plus new and renewed commitments, totaled over $49 billion in the fourth quarter and totaled over $176 billion for the full year of 2012. Total average revolving corporate and commercial commitments outstanding increased year-over-year by 15.6%, and 2.5% on a linked quarter basis, while utilization remained stable at approximately 25%, basically what it's been through the entire year of 2012. Total average deposits increased by $20.5 billion, or 9.2%, over the same quarter of last year and by $4.6 billion on a linked quarter basis, with growth in low-cost deposits particularly strong quarter-over-quarter.","Turning to Slide 8 and credit quality. Total net charge-offs in the fourth quarter decreased by $70 million, or 13%, from the third quarter of 2012, while nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, decreased by $100 million or 4.6%. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding declined to 0.85%, indicative of the high quality of our portfolio.","During the fourth quarter, we released $25 million of reserves compared with $50 million in the third quarter and $125 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Given the mix and overall quality of our portfolio, we expect net charge-offs to be relatively stable to modestly down in the first quarter, while nonperforming assets will continue to trend lower.","Andy will now give you a few more details about our fourth quarter results","Andrew Cecere","Thanks, Richard. Slide 9 gives you a view of our fourth quarter 2012 results versus comparable time periods. Our diluted EPS of $0.72 was 4.3% higher than the fourth quarter of 2011 and 2.7% lower than the prior quarter. Slide 10 details notable items that impacted earnings in the fourth quarters of 2012 and 2011. As previously mentioned, the current quarter included an $80 million foreclosure-related settlement expense accrual that reduced EPS by $0.03.","In the fourth quarter of last year, noninterest income included a $263 million litigation settlement gain related to the termination of a merchant processing referral agreement. We also booked $130 million expense accrual related to other mortgage servicing and foreclosure-related matters. On a net basis, these 2 items increased EPS by $0.05 in the fourth quarter of 2011.","The key drivers of the company's fourth quarter earnings are summarized on Slide 11. The $70 million, or 5.2%, increase in net income year-over-year was a result of a slightly higher net revenue, slightly lower expense and a decrease in the provision for credit losses. Excluding the net after-tax impacts of the notable items detailed on Slide 10, net income year-over-year was higher by approximately 17%.","Net interest income increased year-over-year by $110 million, or 4.1%. The favorable variance was largely driven by the $17.1 billion increase in average earning assets, in addition to strong growth in low-cost deposits and reduced rates on wholesale funding. The 5.8% growth in average earning assets included planned increases in the securities portfolio, as well as growth in average total loans and loans held for sale.","As expected, the net interest margin of 3.55% was 5 basis points lower than the same quarter of last year, primarily due to the increase in lower-yielding investment securities, partially offset by growth in low-cost deposits, lower-cost wholesale funding and reduction in cash balances held with the Fed. Noninterest income declined by 4.2% year-over-year, primarily due to the settlement gain recorded in 2011. Excluding this prior year gain, noninterest income was higher by 7.4%.","Mortgage banking revenue was strong year-over-year, largely reflecting a 27% increase in production and improved gain on sale margins and higher servicing revenue. Also contributing to the income growth were increases in trust and investment management fees, retail and corporate payments revenue, commercial products revenue and investment product fees and commissions. These positive variances were partially offset by a 6.3% decrease in merchant processing, the net result of higher volumes offset by lower rates and the reversal of revenue share accrual in the fourth quarter of 2011.","In addition, ATM processing services revenue was lower, the result of a request within occupancy expense, and other income declined as the fourth quarter of 2011 included a $29 million Visa gain. Noninterest expense was lower year-over-year by $10 million, or 0.4%. The majority of the favorable variance can be attributed to the net $50 million impact of the notable items listed on Slide 10, as well as lower ORE and FDIC insurance expense, partially offset by an increase in professional services, primarily due to the mortgage servicing review-related projects, higher compensation and benefits expense and an increase in tax credit, investment cost and technology expense.","Net income was lower on a linked quarter basis by $54 million, or 3.7%, primarily due to the $80 million settlement expense accrual. Excluding this charge, net income was essentially flat to the third quarter as a result of a 1.3% decline in net revenue, partially offset by a 9.2% reduction in the provision for credit losses.","On a linked quarter basis, net interest income was flat, as growth in average earning assets, which grew by $3.3 billion, was offset by a 4-basis-point decline in net interest margin, primarily due to the repricing of the investment securities portfolio and lower loan rates. The average balance of our investment securities portfolio was $72.9 billion in the fourth quarter, $4.1 billion higher than the fourth quarter of 2011 and just slightly higher than the previous quarter. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest income was lower by $67 million, or 2.8%. This unfavorable variance was primarily the result of a decrease in mortgage banking revenue. Although mortgage production was higher linked quarter by approximately 2.7%, applications were lower by 6.7%.","The change in mortgage banking revenue also reflected a lower gain on sale margin and $16 million increase in the addition to the reps and warranty repurchase reserve to cover the 2004 and 2005 vintage Freddie Mac loans.","Other income also declined linked quarter as a result of the net effect of the third quarter credit card portfolio sale gain and the write-down of our investment in Nuveen. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense was higher by just $77 million, primarily due to the $80 million settlement expense. Going forward, as a result of this settlement, professional services expenses will decline, as the costs associated with the mortgage servicing review, which had been running approximately $50 million per quarter, end.","Turning to Slide 12. Our capital positions remain strong and continues to grow. Based on our assessment of the full impact of the current proposed rules for Basel III standardized approach, we have estimated that our Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio was approximately 8.1% at December 31 versus 8.2% at September 30. At 8.1%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement and above our targeted ratio of 8%.","Slide 13 provides updated detail on the company's mortgage purchase-related expense and the reserve for expected losses on repurchases and make-whole payments. As we indicated in December, after discussions with Freddie Mac, we booked additional reserve to address the put-back risk of the loans originated in 2004 and 2005. Consequently, the addition to the reps and warranty repurchase reserve this quarter was $16 million higher than the third quarter of 2012. Our outstanding repurchases and make-whole request balances at December 31 was $131 million compared with $118 million at September 30. We continue to expect mortgage repurchase requests to remain fairly stable over the next several quarters.","I'll now turn the call back to Richard.","Richard K. Davis","Thanks, Andy. 2012 was a record-setting year for U.S. Bank. We achieved record earnings and record total net revenue, resulting in industry-leading performance metrics. And further, we continue to invest in our businesses and strategically acquired new partners. We added more customers and grew market share. We maintained strong and growing capital and liquidity positions. And we returned $3.4 billion of the company's earnings to our shareholders, and next year, we expect to return more.","In 2013, we will celebrate the 150th anniversary of U.S. Bank. Since our charter was signed in 1863, we have managed through the times of prosperity and adversity. We've grown by investing in our business through acquisition. We have learned from and capitalized on the lessons of our past and become what we are today, a company with a well-diversified business model and a prudent risk management, a company with the ability to produce consistent, predictable and repeatable results. We're focused on the future and continuing to build momentum into 2013 for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our communities and our shareholders.","That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer questions from the audience.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Question for you on loan growth. Good average loan growth, but it looks like the period-end loans are maybe even a little bit higher, a little bit better. And curious if there's anything notable about the growth and if you've noticed any change in sentiment of the borrowers, maybe positive or negative, early on in the year.","Richard K. Davis","Yes. John, this is Richard. There's -- it's pretty much the same story. I think the fiscal cliff uncertainty caused the very last couple of weeks to be a bit muted. But if you take quarter 4 and look into quarter 1, I think at the end of the day, you're going to see a pretty sustainable range of that 4% to 6% annualized. We came in at the high end of that range in quarter 4. I think we're on track for the high end of that for quarter 1, but I wouldn't jump outside of that range based on what I'm seeing. I don't think that people care as much about the debt ceiling and the debate that will occur later in the quarter as they do about the bottom line to their paychecks, as they did about the fiscal cliff. But I do think it's still a fairly uncertain environment, and people at the first of the year aren't jumping on anything new.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, you touched on it but maybe if you can provide us a little more color on how you're thinking about capital allocation on 2013. You talked about returning more money to shareholders, but just kind of walk us through your thought process.","Andrew Cecere","Yes, John. This is Andy. We -- our goal has always been a 60% to 80% return, the combination of dividends and buybacks. We were within that range in 2012. We would expect and we plan to be within that range in 2013. That's how we submitted the CCAR. And as discussed, we'll hear back somewhere towards the end of March regarding the results.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And Richard, you said more, I believe was the phrase in your...","Richard K. Davis","I did so, yes. We're in the lower end of that 60% to 80% range. It's our goal to get -- move further into that range. I doubt that we'll get to 80%, and part of the reason for that is we're still investing in the company. You guys are allowing us to do that, and I think we're getting good returns for those investments. But the CCAR results will be known in a couple of months, and we've put in a request that we think is very fair and reasonable and will help us move that deeper into the 60% to 80% range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","On your mortgage production side, can you -- do you break out what you do for retail versus wholesale?","Andrew Cecere","We don't break that out. But let me give you a couple of facts, Paul, just to maybe round out some of the story. Right around 69% of our production was refinance activity, and gain on sale margins that you see are down a bit. But I think an important fact, too, is the application because we booked the majority of our revenue at app. And our net apps or our gross apps, both of them, were down about 6.7%. Now some of that can be attributable to -- attributed to the seasonality factor that occurs in the fourth quarter, particularly around the holiday season. We still expect the first half of the year to be relatively strong from a mortgage perspective, but the fourth quarter was down a bit principally due to seasonality.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And then, when you're saying gain on sale margins is down slightly, was it mainly -- was that also due to seasonality? Or is that more of a -- did you do more wholesale versus retail in the quarter?","Andrew Cecere","Probably a combination of a little bit of both. And if I do my gain on sale from a perspective of apps, it was down maybe 10 or 15 basis points.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, okay. And then, on your loan growth, are you seeing any -- I mean, I know -- Wells Fargo talked about seeing a lot of C&I and whatnot in the late part of the -- in December as people try to get some things done before the fiscal cliff. Do you -- did you see the same thing? Or could you add some color around that?","Richard K. Davis","We -- not really. I wouldn't have brought it up. I knew you'd ask. And the M&A activity was higher at year's end for all the reasons that people were trying to time and sequence their activities before a fiscal cliff possibility, but not notable. To us, it was not a real impact. As I said, everything kind of slowed down at the very end of the year. That happens anyway, but to a more of a screeching halt just because people were waiting to see what happened, and there's a bit of that recovery in the first few weeks, as John's question might have belied. But if you take the 2 quarters in total, I don't think you'll see any distinction about that fiscal cliff when it's all said and done. And for us, the -- I'd like to give you color on loan differences by geography or loan type or customer, and it really isn't much different than the last couple of quarters we've had in 2012. So for us, it's a lot more of the same. I guess, the recession was -- ended 14 quarters ago, as I'm told. It probably doesn't feel like it to all of us, but whatever recovery we've been under continues to be slow and methodical, and we're feeling the exact same thing. Just a little bit better every month, every quarter, but it's so small you have to go back and add it together just to notice it. So we're seeing that same phenomenon. Not much to report.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Andy, what are some of the puts and takes for the net interest margin looking forward? And what's your best guess on the near-term outlook for the NIM?","Andrew Cecere","Yes, John. So we talked about the fact that we expected the fourth quarter to be down 4% to 6%, it was down 4%. I would expect a similar decline in the first quarter, perhaps a little bit more because the first quarter is seasonally lower with regard to loan fees, both on the wholesale as well as retail side. So down similar level, perhaps a bit more because of loan fees.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And if rates stay low, the longer they stay low, does the reinvestment rate pain begin to ease eventually? And when does that happen if rates stay where they are today?","Andrew Cecere","Yes, it does, John. So the reinvestment risk right now is that $2 billion to $2.5 billion that runs off every month, putting -- and I'm putting it back on in a conservative fashion. The differential in spreads or rate is about 70 to 75 basis points. Because the duration is not that long, as I move into the end of this year and into '14, that starts to compress because what I'm -- what's coming off now is at a lower rate. So that will dissipate over time.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And with the loan growth dynamics that Richard talked about, do you still hope to grow net interest income this year?","Andrew Cecere","That is our goal.","Richard K. Davis","Yes.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then on credit, Richard, I expect -- you still expect charge-offs to move lower, but it sounds like maybe at a slower pace. And then, just what was the outlook on reserve releases?","Richard K. Davis","The answer is yes and slightly a little bit more, but we're coming to an end on reserve releases. So we're at 85 basis points for the portfolio, and we've always said, especially with our credit card business, we should be at about 1%. So we're going to move below that 85 probably into the high-70s. Reserve releases come down to 0 over the course of the next few quarters because it should. And our reserve coverage is sufficient. Both -- it has always been and will be, I think, well within the range of what some of the regulators have been seeking because we don't want to under-reserve or prepare for over this cycle. Our credit portfolio has been really, really predictable, and if you just draw a straight line, you can just keep drawing it with the sloping, settling curve on charge-offs and a continued kind of transition to lower nonperformance for a little bit longer. Bill, do you want to add any color to that?","P. W. Parker","Yes. No, the -- I mean, we're getting at the bottom for some of the gross charge-off rates if you look at credit cards, autos, even some of the commercial. And some of the commercial real estate categories are pretty strong now. So on the wholesale side, some of the impact will be really on the recovery levels that we see, which can -- those are more difficult to project. So we might see a little bit up and down based on recovery levels. But overall, it's just still working out some of the residual residential mortgage and home equity, which will still take another year or 2.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And regarding the new FASB proposals suggesting a life of loan expected loss approach, do we have to start thinking -- or do you have to start thinking ahead to that now or is it too early yet?","P. W. Parker","Well, we're certainly going to comment on it now. There's a comment due from the industry, and we'll comment on it between now and April. Probably the biggest area of impact, which is still the most uncertain, is credit cards. Credit cards take big reserves, and it's just not clear what life of loan means on an open line of credit like that, so a lot more work to be done.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And it's not affecting your reservant behavior right now?","Richard K. Davis","No.","P. W. Parker","No, no.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, great. Last thing for me. Does -- the foreclosure settlement cost, Andy, that $50 million a quarter, will that pretty much end in the first quarter and you'll be done with that right away?","Andrew Cecere","Yes. Well, we experienced about $50 million in quarters 3 and 4. We may have a little bit of a tail on that in the first quarter, $5 million to $10 million, but then it will go away.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America.","Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question was just a follow-up to John's. In terms of the foreclosure review expense of $50 million, is that directly going to impact the bottom line so we shouldn't expect the bank to reinvest it back into the franchise?","Richard K. Davis","Yes. The answer -- it's Richard. The answer is yes. That is the cost that we had primarily to third-party overseers. The entire mortgage servicing business has gotten more expensive because of the new rules, some of which will get finalized in a week or 2 from the CFPB. But under the consent order, the rules have been very stringent, and so we have many, many more employees in run rate cost to managing the servicing portfolio than we used to. Those do not change. For the $50 million that Andy cited, we're primarily the third-party overseers, and that does end. And yes, we can reinvest that back in the company.","Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So we shouldn't necessarily just lop off $50 million from the second quarter run rate expense?","Richard K. Davis","You could, that's a --I'm saying but there are other costs that we're not talking about, which are still burdened in there on a comparative period from prior period. It's a lot more expenses around the mortgaging servicing business than it used to be. We're up to it. We're making enough to offset it. But I didn't want you to think that $50 million was all of the -- was the incremental cost of doing this business, because it's gotten a lot more expensive over the last couple of years.","Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I see. And just my second question is on capital return. Your message on capital return is always dead consistent. If we're just sort of looking at what could be different from this year versus last in the process of the CCAR, what was interesting to me and some investors is in the adverse-case scenario is the Fed is now requiring to stress test against rate shocks, which clearly impacts the securities portfolio. I guess, as you went through the process, I understand the color you may give us may be limited, but does the adverse-case scenario even matter, as you thought about your application for this year? And is the message from the Fed, as they think about accelerating capital return from the banks, as credit risk diminishes, do we have to start thinking about AOCI risk on a go-forward basis?","Andrew Cecere","So Erika, certainly, the adverse case matters. But in our case, anyway, the severely adverse case was more of the binding constraint from the perspective of capital return. So -- and that was the harsher economic downturn, the lower GDP, the higher unemployment. That was a more material factor principally related to credit costs for our numbers. And with regard to OCI, as we've talked about, we are keeping our own cushion of 50 basis points over and above what we project to be our CP buffer of 50, so we get to the 8%. And that's to accommodate the fluctuations of volatility that occurs with OCI, and that's why we keep that cushion.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kenneth Usdin with Jefferies.","Ian Foley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","It's actually Ian Foley for Ken. Just wanted to ask a couple of questions on the mortgage business. Specifically, if volume does start to fade next year, when we look at expenses, how much is fixed versus variable and how quickly can you kind of bring those expenses down if you do see a falloff?","Andrew Cecere","Ian, I would say that the variable expense component of the mortgage business, depending upon the type of production and where it's originated from, would be anywhere between 25% and 40%.","Richard K. Davis","We've been very careful not to build a church for Easter Sunday. I mean, we're not -- we're able to accommodate all of our volume today, but we've got a pretty good variable capability of reducing quickly, adding quickly. And as you look at the future, while it may be higher refis today, we're building this bank to handle new purchases and then be a market leader in that area, which is why we're spending so much care on high quality today because that will affect the reputation we have for the clients that we'll use as the new purchase money when rates start to go up and we start replacing the refi activity. So we're going to overperform the service quality. We're going to have more than enough people in all the places today, but we can adjust very, very quickly. It's one of our best talents around here, and you can well bet that we won't be caught with overhang if there's a change somewhere along the way.","Ian Foley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And my second question is more involved than the servicing side. And I think with the refis, people often overlook just kind of what it means for the MSR and revaluation. I was just hoping you guys could comment on kind of how the hedging strategy has changed and if refi rates do decline, what that could mean for just the servicing income stream in general.","Andrew Cecere","We're fairly -- our mortgage team is very good at the hedging process here. Our net hedge results this quarter was about a $29 million gain versus about $9 million last quarter and about the same level, $30 million, a year ago. So we are very conservative in our approach, and we do try to take into account -- we do take into account all the factors that you described.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research LLC.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","Richard, could you just comment on the QM, what your general impressions were of the QM and whether you think there's going to be an impact to the QM on other retail lending?","Richard K. Davis","So my impressions are actually very positive. I thought they did a nice job of, what I'll call, soft landing, again, to what otherwise was a risk of really muting a slow but assured recovery. Not only is the 43% debt-to-income a fair assumption and a fair starting point, but the very, very slow transition they're going to have with the Freddie\/Fannie rule standards and being able to imply those for quite some time, it's -- I'd like to say it's not a non-issue, but it's not a huge issue. And I think they gave us a lot of time to manage that, never mind we have the whole rest of 2013 to get it right. So I think for the industry, it's something more like 5% to 10% impact. We would be in that same range. And I believe that as we look over the course of time, if I look at it in the cold light part of day, if some of those rules had been around for the industry, particularly the sub-prime and non-bank providers, we actually would have had a better outcome and less of a problem. So I actually think they were quite good. What it means for the rest of the other loans, I don't think it has an infectious impact yet. I only say that because I haven't heard that as one of the next steps. I think there's plenty of other things to work on with the CFPB, particularly non-banks and other activities related to deposit gathering and service charges and things. But, Nancy, I think undoubtedly it will start to take on non-mortgage activity, things that are asset-based but are not necessarily in the same category of the higher risks of bringing down the world. So probably over the next few years, we'll see some -- the same attributes. But I don't think that they are at all immediate, and I don't think when they do come they'll be that bad.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","Question for you, Andy, or maybe for both of you. There was an article in The Wall Street Journal a couple of days ago about the fact that the banks are not making public their Basel leverage ratios. Could you just comment on that? And they inferred or implied that there was risk weighting asset kind of trickery going on. Could you just give me your commentary on that?","Andrew Cecere","Sure. In our case, Nancy, our risk-weighted asset number to total GAAP assets is about 88%. So we don't have a big difference. The differentials for a bank like us and our business model is just not that material. And if you think about our leverage ratio on a -- it's not significant. In fact, it's higher on a Tier 1 number versus our Tier 1 common number, so it isn't a material impact for our company.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Ketron with UBS.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I have a bigger-picture question. If you look at revenue growth in 2012 compared to 2011, you guys put up some very nice revenue growth in light of the environment. And as you look into 2013 with maybe slower loan growth, maybe the risk of the mortgage weakens in the second half of this year, which remains to be seen, and you think about revenue growth in 2013, how do you think about that? What are the areas that you think you can achieve it? Do you expect it to actually slow compared to 2012?","Richard K. Davis","Yes. I'll go first. We do expect it to slow compared to 2012 because we're prudent and careful, and I tell you that because I also promised you positive operating leverage for 2013, so that just means we're going to be watching our expenses. And, Greg, if you follow the story for the last 5 or 6 years, you and your peers have allowed us to be pretty aggressive in spending and catching up on our CapEx. Some of our acquisitions and some of our just investments in the company have been pretty high, and yet we've continued to keep our expense relationship to revenue quite good. That's what we're going to continue to do. But we're on the tail end of that area of investing so extensively, and so the good news is this is a good year for us to keep our expenses more run-rate-related, more in check from not having to play any kind of catch-up. And it's going to be perfect because revenue is expected to grow a little bit less than last year, still positive. They'll both grow. Revenue will grow, expenses will grow by less. We'll grow the balance sheet. We'll have positive operating leverage; we'll make good net income. But each will be muted from the year before. And if, by any chance, things start to get better and the world warms up and we can benefit from that, then the expenses are easily adjusted and we can be more aggressive in some of our investments inside the company, more organic. So we've got a pretty good ability to move those levers quickly, but I want to make it easier to turn clearly. We will grow revenue, but we will just grow it at a pace that's commensurate with the kind of expenses that are needed to keep that in positive operations.","Andrew Cecere","And I would also -- I would comment that we have a couple of businesses that are at the early stages of the growth curve: our commercial products group, our high-grade bond business, municipal underwriting, our wealth management area, all areas that I think will grow in an accelerated fashion in 2013.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And I guess, along those lines, maybe things that we're not seeing that's coming through revenue growth. Do you feel like the U.S. Bancorp business model has even more leverage when we see the business conditions improve and we actually could see even more positive operating leverage generated as a result of that?","Richard K. Davis","We do, yes. Greg, we do. In fact, one of my favorite lines around here is we might be doing really well in tough times but we're building the bank to be great in great times. That's a real important distinction because we're able to handle the kind of muted environment. But when things get good and they get good fast, when that happens, we want to be out in front. The highest debt rating in the business, the reputation we've been able to create over our service quality and some of these new businesses that have kind of rounded out the rest of the capabilities for this company are serving us really well right now. But those are the things that were really meant, I think, the kind of profitability we want in good times. So I'm quite optimistic about it. We used to call it a window of opportunity, where our high position compared to our peers, the high quality of the company, the balance sheet was serving us benefits. That window has been opened longer than I thought it would, and it's getting wider as time passes. And I might close with our staff is better now at leveraging our strength. They're more proud of the company. They're more assured that the company is distinctively performing better in most categories, and they take that story to the customer. And they do a better job of developing better relationships and getting more business. So I'm quite robust in my comments about what this will do for us when times start to get better. We just need to get over the transom of the industry until the economy warms up again.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Todd Hagerman with Stern Agee.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. Just, Andy, going back to your comments in terms of reps and warranties, the repurchase requests remaining relatively stable. Just curious, with the settlement now and basically capturing all the vintages and the improved dialogue with the GSEs, is there a sense that -- I guess, what I'm saying or suggesting is on a go-forward basis, the requests are more in line with the production? Or alternatively, why wouldn't we necessarily see more of a decline in terms of those requests relative to these settlements and the dialogue?","Andrew Cecere","Yes. I think it's just a timing factor, Todd. So I don't expect a blip like we saw this last quarter, like we saw last year. As the vintages increase, I do not expect that, and it will work down over time. But in the short term, I think it'll just be relative relatively stable because it takes a fair bit of time for the requests to work their way through the process.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just in terms -- like your provision have kind of varied over the course of the year. Can you give us a sense of kind of where you find that kind of settling out relative to that request outlook?","Andrew Cecere","Yes. The provision blipped a couple of quarters, and the principal reason for that blip was the increase in the time frame that the GSEs were looking at. So, for example, you saw a $16 million increase this quarter. That was entirely due to that increase in vintage, the '05 and '04. So again, absent that, which I do not expect any more changes going forward, I would expect that to moderate and go downward.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just finally, on the mortgage side, one of the things that's been a focal point -- everyone's kind of -- has a good outlook in terms of at least the first half of '13. But I'm curious, specifically for U.S. Bancorp, what is being done kind of on the front end as the companies look to ramp up the production side relative to that refi, that, at some point, is going to tail off. Your servicing income continues to grow fairly steadily, but I'm just curious kind of what you're doing to prevent a more -- a significant decline in mortgage revenues on a go-forward basis, particularly as refis slow.","Richard K. Davis","Well, this is Richard. We continue to add people, so we're actually flying into the face of the wind here by continuing to believe that until the refi business is assuredly slowing, which we thought 2 years ago, we thought a year ago and I actually don't think even this year will slow. But if it did, we can handle it, for the earlier question. But we're also actually putting more into it. So until it isn't strong, we're going to be stronger. So we're putting more and more into that business, Todd, and building kind of market share value. And as I mentioned, we're also probably putting a little bit more in even than some of our peers, because we want our service quality to be tough quality. We want people to want to do business with us because they'll come back again in the future when they're looking for purchase, as opposed to a refi. We want to be a market share leader in both circumstances. And I'll tell you what you already know, but unless the refis have just absolutely hit some saturation, which they haven't so far and nobody has ever figured out how many times people can refinance a house. They seem to be able to do that endlessly. But when that happens, it's going to be probably as a result of rates starting to trip up. And when rates start to move up, there are other things in the company's balance sheet and income statement that actually will offset the loss of what would be mortgage momentum and then will turn it into a different spread on a different, more purchase-related portfolio, and we'll be getting benefits somewhere else. So it may not be an exact moment in time, but we actually see that to be a pretty good transition when that happens. But more importantly, we're adding more and more to our business and growing it right now while refis are strong and then able to turn that in a heartbeat if and when that moment comes that you've talked about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Given what your comments about kind of revenue growth and operating efficiency and kind of slightly positioning the company for a better environment, can you talk a little bit about what areas you'd likely want to reinvest the most to drive more growth? I mean, where do you think you can be the most kind of competitive?","Richard K. Davis","So Andy teased it out a minute ago when we mentioned that we've got some business lines that are still in kind of their teenage years, our capital markets, some of our wholesale lines of business, wealth management for sure. And those investment curves are behind us, Moshe, but the benefits are still ahead of us. And in fact, in a couple of cases, they've been actually net negative to bottom line in this course of getting them to where they are now. So we've got some natural intracompany opportunities that will mature in another year. It gives them the chance, no matter what the environment is, to get better and stronger. The second thing is we're continuing to build into our technology, in our infrastructure, the mobile banking and mobile payments capability, which you know is -- everybody has a little of that, but that's one of our sweet spots. If you think about U.S. Bank a couple of years ago, you liked us for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is you like our payments business. But you should expect us now is to make that payments business more than corporate, more than government, more than merchant and more now mobile payments for all consumers. And by the recent acquisition of FSV, the prepayment company, and some of the other activities we've been doing in payments, you should expect a lot more from us there, a real leadership position. That investment curve is probably in its middle stages but already parts of it are going to start driving some benefits. And those are fee-based opportunities that don't exist today, that we haven't yet been able to bring to the income statement. So I'm quite optimistic about our own intracompany maturity and the things that we've invested in that will start coming to bear. And that's why I said we'll do well even in tough times. When times get really good, all that stuff got kind of a trebling effect, and it's all very positive.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just one other quick follow-up, and that is on a somewhat related topic. In the past, you've talked originally thinking to try to recapture the lost revenue from Durbin by pricing up your checking account product, then wanting to be more competitive. How do you see that kind of shaking out from a competitive standpoint, the core retail banking offering product in your markets?","Richard K. Davis","Yes. So we did 2 things there. We promised you that we would still get to that 50% recovery. But we told you we're not quite there, and we're not there yet. Two things have happened because we've given ourselves more time. One is we're just growing a lot more net customers. You guys don't suffer through us talking about net customers and going through that because it's a real hard number to measure and everybody can say it. So I just don't waste our time on that. But the fact is, is that our numbers would belie, in hindsight, that we are growing the company. We don't have a free checking product, which is a good thing because we do have customers now that are here on purpose. They don't have second and tertiary accounts that really don't make any money. We've established a relationship on a package basis, where we can add attributes and\/or upsell them into something more reasonable, but for which they know they're buying and for which they have value for. And on top of that, we've taken the same time on consumers, and we've gotten really good at Small Business. Rick Hartnack is the Head of Consumer Banking, who's retiring next month. He actually succeeded me in running Consumer Banking and Small Business. The thing he did that I didn't do when I ran it was he took Small Business and put it on the map for our company, and we are now a very capable and an industry-leading small business provider, both checking accounts and loans and lines. And Moshe, that has been a huge benefit, kind of under the watermark. You can't see it under the surface, but it's a huge driver for the company. It is driving a big part of the closures, some of that fee business is, that we lost to Durbin or some of the CARD Act and things like that because now we just have more of those customers. And they're buying stuff, paying for it, they're aware of it and they want it. So I'm pretty excited about what that cause does to do, which was get good at more things for more people. But we're still not quite where we needed to be to recover all that fee. We'll have to do it again over the course of time. And I think mobile payment is going to -- to tie in my last question -- is going to be one of the things that will help us to derive a new revenue stream that doesn't exist today.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Compass Point.","Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","How much of your residential originations were HARP in the fourth quarter?","P. W. Parker","It was about 11% again. It's been pretty stable.","Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And would you expect an increase in volume due to the changes in reps and warrants provision rules that were implemented by the FHFA on January 1?","P. W. Parker","Essentially, no. I mean...","Richard K. Davis","We're not a big HARP company, and so those are small nuances for us, Kevin. But our company, based on the way we originated in the first place, we just don't have a lot of our volume attributed to that. So when you saw last year a lot of the volume in refis was HARP-related, it was a good question to ask was when does that start to slow. For us, it won't matter in the first place. It was never a big part, and those new reps and warranties and things coming out are very de minimis for us, and they're not going to change our forecast.","Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay. You mentioned a major increase in the servicing costs due to deregulation. Are there anything you could do or are there any mitigating factors that you can implement in order to lower those servicing costs on a go-forward basis?","Richard K. Davis","Yes. There's -- the answer is of course. And that comes in the form of getting better at it, centralizing more of it, automating more of it. But a fair amount of it is a derivative of what started out as the settlement discussion with the big 5 mortgage services, which we weren't a part of, then the consent order. And now what we're waiting for is what will be the final servicing rules that the CFPB owes everybody by January 21. Whatever those will be, I suspect they won't be any more onerous than the consent orders provided, which requires us to do very, very high-bar servicing. So, for instance as an example, the thing called single point of contact, if you were customer in a modified situation, we have to assign you a person. You get Andy Cecere. But if Andy Cecere weren't available at any time for you, then you have to know that Richard Davis will be there for you. And Andy and Richard always have to be there, 1 of the 2 of them, and if perchance they're not, then we have to make sure that Bill is there and that you know Bill is taking over. And it's very, very tedious, right? So I suspect that might be an overreaction to a consent order process to make sure that we all get something right that wasn't at the level they wanted it. So that's the kind of cost we're bearing today that weren't around a couple of years ago. And is it worth it? It's a better servicing model, I'm sure. But I think the new rules will give us kind of a steady answer. So 90 days from now on this call, ask me again and we'll tell you, looking back, what the final rules look like. I suspect they'll be more expensive than they were before rules. I suspect for our company they might actually be less than they are today because we're trying to overperform in the consent order to make sure we can get out of it.","Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","So if you were to estimate the additional cost of to service a mortgage as it compares to what it was 2 years ago, would you say it's approximately double what it was? Or do you....","Richard K. Davis","No. It's probably 25% to 50% higher. So if we're double, we're out of the business because there's not much margin. But it's a new run rate that we've had in the company now for 6 quarters. So for us, it would only be upside if it were to be lesser than it is today. And if it were the same, then we're already bearing that burden, and we can manage to it because the overall business is worthwhile. But it's -- I don't expect it to get worse. So the good news for us is I think we're at a high watermark, and we look forward to, I think, some sustainable new results. And that's why it will go back to consolidating and automating and getting the rules set. Once we know it's permanent, then we can lock down a final protocol.","P. W. Parker","And it's the back-end costs that have gotten more expensive. And as the housing market improves, we see fewer and fewer people with underwater mortgages. So over time, the volumes will go down over the next 2 to 3 years.","Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","But overall, you would expect core servicing expenses to be roughly -- would you say 25% to 30% higher than that what they were on a normalized basis when delinquency levels were much lower?","Richard K. Davis","Kevin, I won't give that number. I'll tell you it's not 0, and it's not 100%. I don't know what it is. We really actually don't think of it that way because we don't think we're in a permanent circumstance. So we're -- I can answer that question in 90 days when we figure out and look back on the new servicing rules. It'll be higher than it used to be. But it won't be inordinately too high and won't want to stay in the business.","Operator","That does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I'll hand the presentation back over to management for any further comments or closing remarks.","Richard K. Davis","I just want to thank you all for giving us the support you've given us last year.

Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings on the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Richard.","Richard K. Davis","Thanks, Judy, and good morning, everyone. I'm very proud to share our third quarter results with you today. I'd like to begin with the highlights on Page 3 of the presentation.","U.S. Bancorp recorded -- reported record net income of $1.5 billion for the third quarter of 2012 or $0.74 per diluted common share. Total record net revenue of $5.2 billion was 8% higher than the same quarter of last year, driven by a 6.1% increase in net interest income and 10.4% increase in fee revenue. Importantly, we achieved positive operating leverage on both a year-over-year and on a linked quarter basis.","Total average loans grew year-over-year by 7.3% or 1.3% linked quarter or 1.6% linked quarter, excluding the impact from the sale of a credit card portfolio. We experienced strong loan growth in total average deposits of 11.1% over the prior year and 3.5% over the second quarter of 2012.","Credit quality continued to improve. Although total net charge-offs increased by 3.5% over the prior quarter, they included $54 million of incremental charge-offs related to a clarification by the regulators as to the treatment of a collateralized consumer loans to consumers that have filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy but continue to make payments on their loans. Excluding this change, net charge-offs decreased by 6.9% quarter-to-quarter.","Nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, declined by 3% linked quarter. Excluding the additional $109 million of consumer assets related to the regulatory clarification, nonperforming assets declined by 7.8% from the prior quarter.","We generated significant capital this quarter through earnings and ended the quarter with a Basel I Tier 1 common equity ratio of 9% and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.9%. Our estimated Tier 1 common ratio under the most recent Basel III rules was 8.2%. We repurchased 17 million shares of common stock during the third quarter, and consequently, we were able to return 67% of our earnings to our shareholders this quarter through dividends and buybacks.","Trends in our industry-leading performance metrics are shown on Slide 4. Return on average assets in the third quarter was 1.7%, and return on average common equity was 16.5%. Both ratios are within our company's long-term goal to achieve a normalized ROA in the range of 1.6% to 1.9% and an ROE between 16% and 19%. Our net interest margin and efficiency ratio are shown on the graph on the right-hand side of Slide 4.","This quarter's net interest margin of 3.59% was 6 basis points lower than the same quarter of last year and as expected, relatively stable compared with the prior quarter's rate of 3.58%. And Andy will discuss the margin in more detail in a few minutes.","Our efficiency ratio for the third quarter was 50.4%, lower than both the prior year and previous quarter as we continue to manage expenses effectively. We expect that this ratio will remain in the low-50s going forward.","Turning to Slide 5. The company recorded record total net revenue in the third quarter of $5.2 billion, an increase of 8% over the prior year's quarter and 2.2% higher than the previous quarter. The company's revenue benefited from growth in both our balance sheet and our fee-based business lines, and once again, mortgage banking was particularly strong.","Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 6. Average total loans outstanding increased by $14.7 billion or 7.3% year-over-year. As expected, linked quarter growth in average total loans was down slightly from the previous quarter as balances grew 1.3% compared with the second quarter's linked quarter growth of 1.9%. Recall, however, that we sold the branded credit card portfolio on August 1 that totaled approximately $735 million. Excluding the impact of this sale, average total loans would have been higher by 1.6% on a linked quarter basis.","Overall, excluding covered loans, our runoff portfolio, average total loans grew by 9.6% year-over-year and 2% linked quarter. The increase in average loans outstanding was primarily due once again to strong growth in commercial loans, which grew by 21.9% year-over-year and 4.2% over the prior quarter. Residential real estate loans also showed strong growth, 20.4% over the same quarter of last year and 4.6% over the prior quarter. Within the other retail loan category, home equity line and loan activity remains subdued, while auto loans and leases continues to show steady growth.","We continue to originate and renew loans and lines for our customers. New originations, excluding mortgage production, plus new and renewed commitments, totaled over $45 billion this quarter.","Total revolving corporate and commercial commitments outstanding increased year-over-year by 21% and 3.5% on a linked quarter basis, while utilization remained fairly consistent at approximately 25.7%.","Total average deposits increased by $23.9 billion or 11.1% over the same quarter of last year and by $8 billion on a linked quarter basis or 3.5%. All of our business lines contributed to this growth.","Turning to Slide 7, and credit quality. Total net charge-offs in the third quarter increased by 3.5% over the second quarter of 2012 but decreased 6.9%, excluding the $54 million related to the regulatory clarification on Chapter 7 loans. Nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, decreased by 3% or 7.8% without the $109 million related to the Chapter 7 loans. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 0.99%, essentially flat to the prior quarter, and excluding the charge-offs related to the regulatory clarification, the ratio was 0.89%.","During the third quarter, we released $50 million of reserves compared with $50 million in the second quarter and $150 million in the third quarter of 2011. Given the overall quality of our portfolio, we expect net charge-offs and nonperforming assets to continue to trend lower in the fourth quarter.","I will now turn the call over to Andy.","Andrew Cecere","Thanks, Richard. Slide 8 gives you a view of our third quarter 2012 results versus comparable time periods. Our record diluted EPS of $0.74 was 15.6% higher than third quarter 2011 and 4.2% higher than the prior quarter.","The key drivers of the company's third quarter earnings are summarized on Slide 9. The $201 million or 15.8% increase in net income year-over-year was the result of an 8% increase in net revenue and a decrease in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a 5.4% increase in noninterest expense.","Net interest income increased year-over-year by $159 million or 6.1%. The increase was largely driven by a 7.9% increase in average earning assets, in addition to strong growth and low-cost deposits and reduced rates on wholesale funding. The 7.9% growth in average earning assets included planned increases in the securities portfolio, as well as growth in average total loans and loans held for sale.","As expected, net interest margin was relatively stable at 3.59% and was 6 basis points lower than the same quarter of last year, primarily due to the increase in lower-yielding investment securities, partially offset by growth in low-cost deposits and lower-cost wholesale funding.","Noninterest income increased by 10.4% year-over-year. Mortgage banking revenue was strong again this quarter as production increased by over 87% year-over-year, gain on sale margins improved and servicing revenue rose. Also contributing to the favorable variance from last year were increases in trust and investment management fees and commercial products revenue.","In addition, as we mentioned in early September, other income in the third quarter included a net impact to the sale of the card portfolio and a loss associated with our investment in Nuveen. These positive variances were partially offset by a 26.3% decrease in credit and debit card fees year-over-year, primarily due to legislative changes to debit card interchange.","Noninterest expense was higher year-over-year by $133 million or 5.4%. The majority of the increase can be attributed to an increase in professional services, primarily due to the mortgage servicing review-related projects and higher compensation and benefits expense due to business expansion and activity.","Net income was higher on a linked quarter basis by $59 million or 5 -- 4.2%. This favorable variance was a result of a 2.2% increase in net revenue, partially offset by a 3.8% increase in the provision for credit losses and a 0.3% increase in noninterest expense. On a linked quarter basis, net interest income was higher by 2.6%.","Average earning assets grew by $5.2 billion, and the net interest income margin rose by 1 basis point over the second quarter, the net result of the positive impact from lower-cost wholesale funding, offset by repricing of the investment securities portfolio. The average balance of our investment securities portfolio was $72.5 billion in the third quarter, $6.2 billion higher than the third quarter of 2011 but slightly lower than the previous quarter.","Assuming stable cash balances and the current Basel III liquidity requirements, we expect to maintain the investment securities portfolio at or around this level for the next few quarters. Also, given the current interest rate environment, we expect the net interest margin to be down a few basis points in the fourth quarter, principally due to the repricing risk on the investment securities portfolio.","On a linked quarter basis, noninterest income was higher by $41 million or 1.7%. This favorable variance was primarily the result of growth in mortgage banking and a net positive impact from the credit card portfolio sale and the write-down of our investment in Nuveen, as well as growth in corporate payment products revenue, deposit service charges and commercial products revenue.","On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense was higher by just $8 million, primarily due to the higher commissions and incentive-based compensation, marketing and business development expense and higher tax credit investment expense, all of which were essentially offset by the favorable variance from the second quarter Visa settlement charge.","Turning to Slide 10. Our capital position remains strong and continues to grow. We have included estimates of our Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted asset ratio using the Basel III proposed rules published both before and after June 7. Based on our assessment of the full impact of the current proposed rules for the Basel III standardized approach, we have estimated that our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was approximately 8.2% as of September 30 versus the 7.9% at June 30. At 8.2%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement and above our targeted ratio of 8%.","Slide 11 provides updated detail on the company's mortgage purchase-related expense and the reserve for expected losses on repurchases and make-whole payments. Our outstanding repurchases and make-whole payments request balance at September 30 was $180 million compared with $164 million at June 30.","During the quarter of 2012 -- third quarter 2012, we added $36 million to the reserve and believe the level of reserves at September 30 is appropriate. We continue to expect mortgage purchase requests to remain fairly stable over the next several quarters.","I'll now turn the call back to Richard.","Richard K. Davis","Thanks, Andy. I'm very proud to say that we once again were able to deliver a record-setting quarter. We achieved record earnings and industry-leading performance by growing our balance sheet, our customer base and our market share. We did it by achieving record total net revenue, by realizing positive operating leverage, by improving our credit quality and by maintaining strong and growing capital and liquidity positions while returning 67% of our quarterly earnings to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks.","We continue to manage this company for the long term by investing in our diverse and stable mix of business, by maintaining the prudent approach to risk that has served us so well throughout this latest cycle, by providing our customers with the products and services they need to help them shape their future and reach their dreams, and finally, by supporting our employees and our communities, all while producing consistent, predictable and repeatable results for the benefit of our shareholders.","That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer questions from the audience.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Erika Penala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My question is on capital return. It seems like the banking industry, your bank, in particular, is coming into the stress test with clearly much stronger capital levels, and it feels like the global macro picture is a little bit better than it was at this point last year. Is it fair to assume for investors that strong banks like U.S. Bancorp can then continue to increase their capital return levels next year? And if not, what are the blind spots that you're seeing from your side that we're not seeing as investors in terms of that premise?","Richard K. Davis","Erika, it's Richard. I don't think there are any blind spots, but I think we all see and know the same information at this stage. Without the final rules and without the final scenario, it's still the Fed's option to decide what stress scenario they want to set us up for, and those assumptions are yet to be shared with us. And unless we learn something new at this stage, we're still operating under the guidelines we've been in the past couple of years of the dividends being limited to 30% of future near-term earnings and the rest being allowed for some form of share buybacks. Until and unless we learn different rules, we're going to operate under that assumption and wait for the final guidance that will come in the next few weeks.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just a quick follow-up question. I know a lot of the management teams have been talking about the fiscal cliff as it impacts demand. Is there -- do you think, this is for Bill, there would be an actual impact on credit quality if the worst-case scenario in the fiscal cliff plays out on the consumer side? It's something that -- a discussion I'm starting to hear, but I guess it's not something that I've fully thought about yet.","P. W. Parker","Well, if the worst case happened on the fiscal cliff, I think it's fair to say we'd probably reenter a recession. And that would be then you'd see unemployment go up, and that would have an impact on consumer portfolio. I'm hopeful that they come to some kind of resolution, and I think the fiscal cliff was designed in such a way that it's so severe, I think it's unlikely that there won't be some political solution that cuts the middle ground and mitigates that risk.","Richard K. Davis","Erika, I think -- this is Richard. I also think when the recession started last time, there was a different quality of customers that had loans from banks. And as you think about it, 5 years later, a very high quality of customers now are remaining in the bank portfolios that either haven't been charged off or, in fact, haven't been originated. So I do think it'd be a lagging effect, certainly would be a negative effect, but I don't think it would be immediate. And I think you'd once again see the nuances of credit quality in each bank's portfolio as they would be stressed at different speeds and different depths based on the recession.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Sandler O'Neill.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I'd say, I guess, Andy, probably a question for you. I mean, you guys have been able to hold in the margin pretty well, and I appreciate the color on the anticipated fee-based points of compression over the next quarter or so. And I guess just from the way you look at things, what's your sense for how long that margin compression persists? Is there some point where repricing on various pieces of the asset side just kind of get fully baked in? How are you thinking about that dynamic? And then I guess, additionally, you and others have been growing the resi mortgage portfolio for the last few quarters. Was just curious for thoughts on what kind of stuff you're putting on if there's been any change in what types of mortgages you're willing to put on just given all the variables at play.","Andrew Cecere","Okay. So first, on the margin. As a reminder, this quarter, third quarter, we improved by 1 basis point, principally due to improvement in our wholesale funding because some high debt was rolling off. We talked about that, we said it'd be relatively stable. That offset the headwind of the repricing on the securities portfolio. In the fourth quarter, we don't have as much debt rolling off, but we continue to have the headwind on the repricing -- on the securities portfolio and that's what's causing the few basis points down. What happened in the last 30 or 60 days is that sort of 2-year period to 5-year period of the yield curve, and what we're buying has come down 25 to 30 basis points. And that's the headwind we're seeing. The loan and deposit side are sort of offsetting, so my focus is on the securities portfolio. And that 2- to 5-year area is where we're focused on, and our duration is sort of closer to the lower end of that range. So that's where we're focused on for quarter 4. I'm not going to project out to next year yet because there are a lot of moving parts here and things can change rapidly as we saw the last 30 days. So a few basis points in the fourth quarter. Whatever we face in 2013 will be manageable, but that principal headwind is securities portfolio. In terms of what we're putting on the balance sheet, on our residential mortgage, it's principally a product we call Smart Refinance, which is a branch-based high-quality, typically 15-years-and-in mortgage product that, again, has originated out of our branches.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom from RBC Capital Markets.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a question on loan growth. You obviously had a decent quarter when you adjust for the card portfolio sale, but it looks like the commercial and the commercial real estate, the pace is a little bit slower, still good numbers. But Richard, just a question for you. Is the loan growth a little weaker than you thought? Is it normal in your view? Does it reflect an increase in borrower caution? And then maybe do you see any changes in that in terms of Q4 and beyond?","Richard K. Davis","I think the answer is yes, yes and yes. [indiscernible] lost order. I do think it's coming down. When you look at our linked quarter and you annualize that and it's lower than our full -- our real annual number. I think you'd see our company growing the books 6% to 7% on an annualized basis up until now, and I think I'm going to guide you down to 4% to 6% in the next quarter and until we know what happens after the election and the fiscal cliff. I, like Andy, we pride ourselves on giving you guys really, I think, high-quality guidance, and we don't want to go too far out when there's too many variables. I do think that is emblematic though of customers feeling less comfortable. I think it makes sense, too. I mean, we're not surprised. I wish it was higher, but I think it makes sense because you've got the near-term election uncertainty, you've got the fiscal cliff uncertainty, you've got the European recession, you've got the economy. And those are -- all those are not going to be solved imminently, but they are going to be solved eventually. So I'm going to be pleased with 4% to 6% annualized. We'll take anything we can get above that. Commercial is a great proxy for, I think, sentiment. And while it's still growing nicely, people are getting more lines than they're using, and they're still not using the lines they have. So I think that uncertainty reminds us that there's still plenty of pent-up possibility. I'll also remind you that our deposits continue to grow at amazing levels, and much as I like that, those deposits need to start getting used first. And after that, the lines of credit will get used, and then eventually, new lines will be originated and used. So we're still in a cycle so early that we haven't seen the beginning of that set of activities where the deposits start getting used for growth and for investment. So I think we're a ways off.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just one question for Bill. You touched a little bit on the consumer portfolio and what could happen under a fiscal cliff scenario, but obviously, we have $54 million of charge-offs rolling off this next quarter. And when I look at the card portfolio, those losses continue to go lower and lower. And I guess my question for you is how long can that last in the card portfolio? How low can that go? Obviously, probably going to drop under 4% this quarter, but just curious on your outlook for that in terms of how good it can get.","P. W. Parker","Well, in terms of rates, I would say, or in terms of dollars, we're probably at a low point. I mean, it's not going to get much below 4%. So that would be a great place to stay for a long period of time. So if the economy cooperates and is steady on the employment front, we'll continue to see that performance. And anything around 4%, it's extremely profitable.","Richard K. Davis","Jon, it's Richard. I'll remind you that without that $54 million, our prevailing charge-off level now is 0.89%. We continue to remind you all that based on the mix of our business, particularly with credit card in there, we think we're at 1% over the term charge-off level, and we will continue to guide that 0.89% down at least in the next quarter, I think, unless there's some surprise event. So for us, we're going to be at unsustainably low levels. In a perfect world, you could criticize us in hindsight for not having used our balance sheet better so we can stay at that 1%, but there's no way to know what was available back when times were tough. And we're going to be really underutilizing our balance sheet for a while until we can start to originate. I think the industry is going to have unsustainably low levels of charge-offs and low levels of non-performs until which time things start to warm up and then you have to watch all of us to be careful on the way up, that we don't get sloppy or get greedy and start making loans just because the environment warms up. So for now, it's going to be at levels that I wish were actually higher, but for the near term, you can expect them to trend down a bit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies & Company.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask just a couple of quick questions on the fee side of things. Number one, it looks like -- while there's still growth in fees overall, it looks like some of the payments lines have slowed on a year-over-year basis from a growth rate perspective. I just -- I was wondering if you can kind of walk us through if there's any specific things that are happening within the businesses or is it more macro-related. And how do you expect these businesses to grow as we look ahead?","Andrew Cecere","Sure, Ken. This is Andy. So let me start with the credit card line. The biggest impact there is the Durbin impact to us, and that's just over $80 million on a year-over-year basis. So that's the principal change there. On the merchant line, we continue to see same-store growth of somewhere between 3% and 4%. However, the DIA or the merchant discount rate is down a little bit, principally due to mix because airlines are growing a little bit more rapidly. So that's what we're seeing there. I would expect relative stability in that rate going forward, and it's back to the growth in conjunction with same-store sales, which again right now we're looking at that 3% to 4% level.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Can you also talk a little bit about just on the commercial side as well?","Andrew Cecere","Yes. So on the corporate card side of the equation, we're seeing a little bit more of that going to margin as opposed to fee income. It depends upon the frequency and the timing of the payment of their credit card balances, and it's a little bit more rapid. So you're seeing a benefit up -- or expense a little bit more, expense up in margin, a little less bit less on the fee category. Again, I would expect that to be relatively stable on a go-forward basis.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And on the mortgage banking side, obviously, another strong quarter, even with a higher MSR impairment. Could you just give us some context of just how you expect the refi environment to play out, how your pipelines are looking for originations? And do you think '13 could be a kind of elongated process here as far as where the mortgage market is heading from an origination perspective?","Andrew Cecere","Right. So Ken, we did 21.6% -- or 20.6% in production. 65% of it was refinanced activity, 35% new. We still have a healthy pipeline on a backlog of refinance activity. And given the current rates, I would expect that the combination of refinance and our growth in taking market share and new business to allow us to have fairly healthy production well into 2013.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then -- okay, great. And then the last real quick one is just regarding liability costs. I know, and you don't want to go into '13 guidance on NIM, but just a question just about the right side of the balance sheet. I know you have fewer debt retiring in the fourth, but you still have the rollover of what happened in part of this quarter and still kind of an all-in higher cost of wholesale borrowings. How much room do you still have as far as both wholesale cost and on core deposit cost to continue to lower interest bearing liability cost?","Andrew Cecere","Right. So on the debt runoff side, we had about $6 billion runoff in the third quarter. On a go-forward basis the next few quarters, I would expect that to be closer to $1 billion to $2 billion. So the rate of decline or runoff or rollover will certainly come down, and that will help us less but still help us. We still have a little bit of room on deposits because while the deposit rate in total is low, you have to remember, within there, there are categories that are paying well above that and categories that are paying 0 to just a few basis points. So we have a little bit of room there. And as we talked about, our loan spreads on a spread basis have been relatively stable on the wholesale side of the equation. So I think we can manage fairly effectively the loan versus the deposit side. That headwind continues to be the repricing on the securities portfolio.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Right. Because if you're putting on 4-some-things against a 40-basis-point incremental cost of deposits, you're still -- your loan versus deposit is still better than your average margin is.","Andrew Cecere","Yes, that is correct. And as you think about the securities portfolio, the way I think about it is what's running off is coming off. It's somewhere between 230 and 240 [ph]. And what we're putting on, we're being very conservative in what we're putting on. It's probably coming on 75 basis points below that. So that's the difference. And we have a runoff somewhere between $1 billion and $2 billion a month.","Richard K. Davis","Ken, this is Richard. I'm going to go back to mortgage for a minute and offer something you didn't ask. We really like the mortgage business. And we're going to continue to invest in it, and we're continuing to grow in it. We've got great market share positions, but we're also seeing a lot of other value that comes from being in the mortgage business. Eventually, this is unsustainable. These numbers aren't going to be this way forever. We know that. So we're building the future of the bank to find alternative ways to develop fee businesses and find other things through our payments and our corporate trusts. And so we're not going to rely on this forever, but as long as interest rates are low, we have a pretty robust near-term future that we think this continues at some of these same levels. Eventually, rates go up, refis will fall. They'll go quickly at first, and then they'll fall to almost nothing. And there will be a purchase money shop, and we want to still be in the top rankings of national performance in the purchase area. And when rates go up, then the balance sheet will make money in other places, and we hope that those will offset as well. But we know this is not a sustainable forever kind of position, but we're not going to forgive it or give it away. While we're in it, we're going to keep growing it. Our quality is good, our market position is good, our reputation is good and we're going to play that as far as we can at least well into next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Ketron from UBS.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Richard, you talked about continuing to pick up market share, and you guys have done a great job of taking advantage of your position through the cycle. In the current environment, are you finding it -- and it's hard to gain market share. Are you finding it continuing to be, I won't call it easy, but able to gain market share? Or are you seeing competition become more difficult on that front?","Richard K. Davis","Yes, it's a mixed bag. I mean, we're still enjoying what we call this flight to quality where, especially the more sophisticated customers from corporate down to middle market, they value those debt ratings, they value our #1 position. That means a lot to them. And so that is getting stronger actually as these quarters go by because they're valuing it and they understand the difference. As you get to the more consumer side, there's still -- much as I'd like to think that every consumer is paying attention to ratings and bank performance, they're not often, they're more measured by the quality of the relationship, the individuals that they deal with and the -- in some cases, the location. Therefore, I think we have to duke it out in the streets in the old-fashioned way for market share and earn it through customer quality and product sets and doing things like mobile banking and mobile payments and things that are cutting-edge where other companies might follow. So that's probably more a traditional way of thinking of it. I will say that on the wholesale side, we still see the retreat of the European banks giving us benefit in higher syndication positions and new involvements in deals that we weren't before. I'd also say, on the other side of the spectrum, the community banks, which used to be very, very robust and quite hard to compete with, they have been muted as well for reasons that are pretty obvious, and they're not giving us quite the same margin compression or the irrational competition we've had in past. So I'd say overall, we're enjoying this flight to quality. It actually gets stronger as the quarters age. And I guess answering your question, it probably is a little easier actually. And I'll tell you what, it darn well better be because this team, the way we're going to make money in this difficult long-term environment with rates low and yield curves flat is we're going to have to do it by market share, and that's the only way you can do it. And after all these years of all sitting around, everybody is saying we're growing market share, and you're wondering if anybody is. I think we are, and we're going to continue to make that a real reason for us to emerge eventually a strong bank when times get great.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right. I appreciate the color. And then one question on share repurchase. I know you did $16 million in the first quarter, $13 million in the second quarter and then $17 million in the third quarter. You're authorized to do $100 million under the CCAR process. Is the way to think about it, that you've purchased $30 million of the $100 million so far under CCAR or would you look at that as more like $46 million under CCAR and you still have roughly half to go?","Andrew Cecere","I would look at it, the $30 million, quarters 2 and 3 for the most part. A little bit of the quarter 1 was under the new authorization, but very little, and part of the difference is the difference in share price. So -- and, again, as a reminder, it goes through the first quarter of 2013.","Richard K. Davis","We put our own governor on, as you recall, when the capital fell below the 8%. We withheld buybacks until we got back to that level, and now we're back at 8.2%. But I want you to know that in and above the roles and the responsibilities of CCAR, we'll do what we need to do that's right for the company, and we'll manage ourselves within those bounds to give you the right answer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Werner from Morningstar Equity.","Dan Werner - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Could you give a little more color on the commercial loan growth? I was wondering how much came from current lines versus new customers. And then just to kind of follow up on the previous question. Have you found it more difficult to acquire new customers given what's going on in the world with the fiscal cliff and the election? And do you expect better results or better new customer growth after the election?","P. W. Parker","This is Bill. I think since our utilization has really not budged, in fact, it's still at sort of all-time lows. So the growth we see is across all of our wholesale areas. It's in the corporate area, the middle market area, even small business. So we've seen good growth across areas. It is market share. As far as the impact in the fourth quarter, reiterating what Richard said, we do see caution out there. But we think assuming we get past all the uncertainties over the next 2, 3 months, we do see a resumption of activity early next year. So we do anticipate to continue to grow our market share next year.","Dan Werner - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then a second question. In the investment portfolio, what type of securities are you adding on as securities are being called or mature?","Andrew Cecere","Principally, Freddie, Fannie and Ginnie Maes, just a very small amount of treasuries, keeping a fairly short duration in that 2-or-so year category.","Dan Werner - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. Any thoughts on when you think you may go longer duration. I mean -- or is that just kind of too far to look out given the current rate environment?","Andrew Cecere","We're trying to be very conservative about this and continue to remain asset-sensitive, and that's where we're managing the balance sheet.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn it back over to the presenters for any closing remarks.","Richard K. Davis","Well, this is Richard. Thank you for your interest in the company. I think maybe by the lack of questions, I hope you know that this is a pretty standard, almost boring quarter and a pretty boring bank. We're pretty proud of that. And I think you can count on us to continue to give you guidance in public settings to help you be close to where you expect us to be, and I think we've done that here today. And we're in an environment that's not going to be easy for anybody. But if anybody is going to do well, then it's going to be us. And we'll continue to not provide any surprises or throw anything your way that you didn't see coming. So thank you for that.","Judith T. Murphy","Great. Thanks, all, for listening to the call. And as usual, if you have any questions, please feel free to call either myself or Sean O'Connor in Investor Relations.

Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Cecere, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon EST through Wednesday, January 29, at 12:00 o\u2019clock midnight EST. I will now turn the conference call over to Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.","Judy Murphy","Thank you, Tiffany, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review US Bancorp's fourth quarter and full year 2013 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during our prepared remarks. A copy of this slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Richard.","Richard Davis","Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I'll begin with a few highlights from U.S. Bank's 2013 full year results on Page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bancorp [reported] recorded net income of $5.8 billion for the full year of 2013 or $3 per diluted common share. We achieved industry leading profitability with a return on average asset of 1.65% and return on average common equity of 15.8% and efficiency ratio of 52.4%.","Total average loans grew by 5.6% and average deposits grew a strong 6.3% year-over-year. Credit quality continued to improve at a 30.1% decline in net charge-offs and a 13.2% decrease in nonperforming assets excluding covered assets. Our capital position end of the year stronger with a Tier 1 common equity ratio of 9.4%, in total, we returned $4 billion or 71% of our 2013 earnings to our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.","Turning to Slide 4 and our quarterly highlights, U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2013 or $0.76% per diluted common share. Total average loans grew by year-over-year by 5.7% and as expected 1.5% or 6% annualized, on a linked-quarter basis. We experienced strong loan growth in total average -- strong growth in total average deposits of 5.4% over the prior year and 1.8%, or 7.2% annualized on a linked-quarter basis.","Credit quality remained strong. Total net charge-offs decreased by 4.9% from the prior quarter, while total nonperforming assets declined, linked quarter by 7.9%. We continued to generate significant capital this quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio estimated using the final Basel III capital regulations was 8.8% at December 31 and we returned 65% of our earnings to shareholders during the fourth quarter through dividends and the repurchase of 13 million shares of common stock.","Slide 5 provides you with a 5-quarter history of our performance metrics, and they continue to be ranked among the best in the industry. Return on average assets in the fourth quarter was 1.62%, and return on average common equity was 15.4%.","Moving over to the graph on the right, you can see that this quarter's net interest margin was 3.40% as anticipated a few basis points lower than the third quarter. Our efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 54.9%, higher than previous quarter due to the seasonally higher expenses and the impact of accounting presentation changes related to investments and tax advantage projects. These changes did not impact net income attributable to U.S. Bank and Andy will discuss them in more detail in a few minutes.","As we have stated in the past, our goal is to maintain an efficiency ratio in the low 50s by continuing to manage expenses in relation to revenue trends, while continue to invest in and grow our businesses. And we do expect the efficiency ratio to return to the low 50s in 2014.","Turning to Slide 6. The company reported total net revenue in the fourth quarter of $4.9 billion, a 4.4% decrease from the prior year and essentially equal to the third quarter. The decline in revenue year-over-year was largely driven by lower mortgage banking revenue as well as a decrease in net interest income. Linked quarter, a decrease in noninterest income driven again by lower mortgage banking revenue was offset by seasonally higher revenues in other business lines and an increase in net interest income.","Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 7. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $12 billion or 5.7% year-over-year and 1.5% on a linked quarter basis. Overall, excluding covered loans, a run-off portfolio, average total loans grew by 7.3% year-over-year and 1.9% linked quarter. ","Once again, the increase in average loans outstanding was supported by strong growth in average total commercial loans, which grew by 7.8% year-over-year and 1.3% over the prior quarter. Total average commercial real estate also increased over the prior quarters, with an average loans growing by 6.7% year-over-year and 2.1% linked quarter.","Residential real estate loans continue to show strong growth, 17.6% year-over-year and 3.2% over the prior quarter. Within the retail loan category average credit card loans and auto loans and leases were both high year-over-year and linked quarter while average home equity lines and loans continue to decline. The rate of decline in this category however has slowed considerably over the past few quarters.","We continue to originate and renew new loans and lines for our customers, new originations excluding mortgage production plus new and renewed commitments totaled approximately $50 billion in the fourth quarter up 4% linked quarter. Total average revolving commercial and commercial real-estate commitments continue to grow at a faster rate than loans increasing year-over-year by 10.1% and 2.7% on a linked quarter basis. Line utilization edged down slightly again this quarter to approximately 23%.","Total average deposits increased by over $13 billion or 5.4% over the same quarter of last year and by $4.5 billion or 7.2% annualized on a linked quarter basis. With growth in low cost interest checking, money market and savings deposits particularly strong on a year-over-year basis.","Turning to slide eight, in credit quality. Total net charge-offs in the fourth quarter decreased by $16 million or 4.9% from the third quarter of 2013 while non-performing assets excluding covered assets decreased by $67 million or 3.6%. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding in the fourth quarter declined to 0.53% from 0.57% in the third quarter. During the fourth quarter we released $35 million of reserves, $5 million more than in the previous quarter and $10 million more in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Given the mixed and quality of our portfolio we currently expect total non-performing assets to remain relatively stable in the first quarter of 2014, while we expect the level of net charge-offs to increase modestly in the first quarter of 2014, as commercial and commercial real-estate recoveries declined relative to the current quarter.","Andy will now give you few more details about our fourth quarter results.","Andy Cecere","","Thanks Richard. Slide 9 gives you a view of our fourth quarter 2013 results versus comparable time periods. Our diluted EPS was $0.76, was 5.6% higher than the fourth quarter of 2012 and equal to the prior quarter. ","The key drivers of the Company\u2019s fourth quarter earnings are summarized on slide 10. $36 million or 2.5% increase in net income year-over-year was primarily the result of lower producing for credit losses and well managed expense partially offset by lower net revenue.","Non-interest income declined year-over-year by $50 million or 1.8%, the result of 2.3% increase in average earning assets which was more than offset by 15 basis point decrease in net interest margin. The $7.3 billion growth in average earning assets year-over-year included increases in average total loans and investment securities. Offsetting the portion of the growth in these categories was a $5.8 billion reduction in average loans held for sale reflecting lower mortgage origination activity versus the same quarter of last year and a $3.8 billion reduction in average other earning assets, primarily due to the reconsolidation of a number of community development entities in the third quarter of 2013.","The net interest margin of 3.40% was 15 basis points slower than the fourth quarter of 2012, primarily due to lower rates on investment securities as well as growth in the portfolio and lower rates on loans partially offset by lower rates on deposits and a reduction in higher cost long-term debt. Non-interest income declined by $173 million or 7.4% year-over-year, primarily due to mortgage banking revenue, which reflected lower origination and sales revenue.","Lower corporate payments revenue, products revenue the result of lower government related transactions also contributed to the decline. Government spending was down about 18% year-over-year. Growth in several free categories help to offset these unfavorable variances, including growth in retail payments, merchant processing, trust and investment management fees, deposit service charges, commercial products revenue and investment product fees.","Non-interest expense declined modestly year-over-year by $4 million or 0.1%, the modest decrease was primarily the result of lower professional services expenses due to a reduction in mortgage servicing review related cost and the positive impact from an $80 million mortgage foreclosure related regulatory settlement accrual in the fourth quarter of 2012.","These favorable variances were offset by higher benefits expense primarily pension related and higher tax advantage project cost, including the accounting presentation changes in the current quarter. In the fourth quarter we changed the presentation of some tax credit related items in our income statement. These changes were not significant and had no impact on EPS. The impact of the changes is shown on the chart on this slide.","These changes in addition to our favorable conclusion on some state tax matters reduced the effective tax rate to 23.8% on a tax equivalent basis in the fourth quarter. This new presentation will continue in future periods. However in the first quarter of 2014 we also expect to adopt new accounting guidance recently issued by FASB, which will move non-interest expense on certain tax credit investments to tax expense. Including all of these changes, we expect our tax rate in 2014 to be about 29% on a tax equivalent basis.","Net income was lower on a linked quarter basis by $12 million or 0.8% primarily as a result of seasonally higher expense partially offset by lower provision for credit losses. On a linked quarter basis, net interest income was higher as the $4.5 billion increase in average earning assets was only partially offset by a modest decline in the net interest margin. The increase in average earning assets was the result of growth in loans and securities partially offset by a reduction in average loans held for sale. The net interest margin of 3.40% was 3 basis points lower than the third quarter, primarily due to the growth in lower tax investments, lower rate investment securities as well as strong deposit growth, which resulted in higher cash balances at the [bank].","On a linked quarter basis, non-interest income was lower by $21 million or 1%. Again, this unfavorable variance primarily reflected the decline in mortgage banking revenue as well as seasonally lower corporate [payments] revenue. Partially offsetting the decline in these revenue categories was an increase in retail payments, trust and investment management fees, commercial product revenue and other income.","On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense was up $117 million or 4.6%, driven by higher costs related to tax-advantaged projects including the accounting presentation changes, seasonally higher professional services expense and the timing of marketing and business development projects. Given normal first quarter seasonality and FASB's new accounting guidance related to tax credit investments, we expect first quarter 2014 expense to be similar to the third quarter of 2013.","Turning to slide 11. Our capital position is strong and continues to grow. Based on our assessment of the final rules for the Basel III standardized approach, we estimate that our common equity tier 1 ratio at December 31st was 8.8%, up from 8.6% at September 30th. At 8.8%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement and above our targeted ratio of 8%.","In the fourth quarter, we returned 30% of our earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends and 35% through the repurchase of 30 million shares of stock for a total return of 65%. Our tangible book value per share rose to $14.41 at December 31st, representing an 11.9% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 4.3% increase over the prior quarter. In early January, we completed and submitted our 2014 capital plan to the Federal Reserve. We are now waiting for regulatory approval to raise our dividend and continue our stock buyback program in 2014.","Finally, slide 12, provides updated detail on the company\u2019s mortgage repurchase related expense and reserve for expected losses on the repurchases and make whole payments. The record warranties repurchase reserve was $83 million at December 31st compared with a $176 million at September 30th. The decline in the reserve reflected the December agreement with Freddie Mac that resolved substantially all repurchase obligations related to reps and warranties made on loans sold to Freddie Mac between 2000 and 2008. The $53 million settlement was reflected in net realized losses for the quarter.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Richard.","Richard Davis","Thanks Andy. I\u2019m very proud of our 2013 results. We achieved record earnings while we manage through a challenging economic environment and a significant pullback in mortgage banking activities as well as in an environment of regulatory and legislative change and uncertainty.","We continue to invest in our businesses throughout 2013, both organically and through acquisitions. For example, we added a small Municipal Bond Trustee business in March, strengthening our position as the number one provider to municipal trustee and agency services in United States. And in November, we announced the acquisition of Quintillion Limited an Ireland-based full service hedge-fund administrator, further expanding our alternative investment servicing network in Europe.","And we began the New Year with an announcement of the purchase of the Chicago branch franchise owned by RBS Citizens Financial Group. This investment while nearly double our market share in this great market within our footprint strengthening our position and adding product, services and convenience for new and existing customers as well as value for our shareholders. These acquisitions, combined with our ongoing investments in innovative product enhancements, services and people has enabled us to continue to grow our balance sheet and our fee-based businesses and gain market share.","U.S. Bank\u2019s performance metrics continue to be best in class. We are focused on the future, building our company to perform as we have in the past, producing consistent, predictable, repeatable results for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our communities and our shareholders. ","That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer questions from our audience.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America ","Yes, good morning.","Richard Davis","Hi, Erika.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America ","My first question is on the loan demand outlook for this year. Richard, it\u2019s clear that your bank has been a market share taker over the past several years. But as you look out into this year, are we at an inflection point in terms of loan demand picking up based on what you are hearing from your corporate customers and the activity level that you may be seeing on the consumer side?","Richard Davis","Erika, I believe that\u2019s true, and I\u2019ll tell you what. I think it maybe a tale of two halfs of the year. I think 2014 starts well looking a lot like 2013 where people continue to husband cash and kind of a hold-off until they see some of the earlier spring sentiment that comes about and whether or not consumers are going to spend and therefore corporations are going to invest. I will tell you as you know the first trigger in that transaction of people spending is the deposit actually going down and our deposits grow and I\u2019m glad they are for the extent that we\u2019re getting more customers. But to the extent that they use their deposits first, they\u2019ll then use our line of credit second and they will extend more credits later in that cycle. And we\u2019re not seeing as much of that yet as we like to at the early stages. The sentiment however is completely different. The sentiment is stronger than it\u2019s been in all these last January\u2019s people are much more willing to talk about future investments. I think consumers are starting to think about doing things to add to their house or spend more money for improvements and may be some discretionary items they hadn\u2019t before. And so my intuition tells me we're on the verge and advent of an increasing sentiment for consumer spending, but I think we'll see it second half of the year and I think this spring will really tell the tale. ","In our companies, in order to offset the expected and predicted reduction in mortgage refinances, we're continuing to spend energy on becoming a market share leader on purchases. And we've also as you know introduced that we're doubling our indirect lending and leasing program over the next few years and even already we're seeing a significant increase in the auto loan volume that we would have otherwise at even over a year ago, up over 30% from fourth quarter of \u201912. So, I believe that our ability to offset the mortgage and predicted mortgage change, keep market share positions there and add other consumer products like small business, credit card and indirect.","I think we're positioned quite nicely, I just think it\u2019s going to be the second half where you will see the most likely balance sheet impacts that will follow the sentiment we're hearing today.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America ","Got it. And as a follow-up question for Andy, could you give us a sense of where you stand in terms of complying with the LCR proposals as they are currently written and how we should think about potential balance and margin impacts further balance of the year?","Andy Cecere ","","Yes, thanks, Erika. There are still some questions with regard to the final roles and the interpretation but I'll tell you that we increased the securities portfolio to 80 billion in the fourth quarter and we are expecting to increase it to 85 billion by the end of the first quarter. That will impact margin a few basis points similar what you saw this quarter and that again is our current expectation. We're still working both sides of the balance sheet; the right and left hand side and working through the questions, but right now 85 billion under quarter one.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay, great. So, I just wanted to run through the discussion that you had, it was pretty quick on the accounting changes, may be you could help us understand why you chose to take the accounting changes at this quarter and then you have a follow up in first quarter.","Andy Cecere","So, Betsy this is Andy. So starting in the fourth quarter we moved the amortization of some guaranteed tax credits, from tax expense to non-interest expense. And then we also moved some third party share of losses, we moved the entire third party share of losses on syndicated cash credits to non-interest expense where the related losses are reported. And then finally in the first quarter of 2014 we're going to move some low income housing cost from expense to tax. So the net of all that is what we talked about on page 10, the impacts you see there which lower our tax rate and increase our expense but you'll see a little bit of a reversal in the first quarter. So, when all said and done, our TEB rate for next year will be about 29% and our expense in the first quarter we expect to be closer to what it was in the third quarter of this year.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay, all right. So, this is really [fortune], is really a transitory towards a new normal which is similar to your old normal.","Andy Cecere ","","Correct, that\u2019s correct Betsy.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then secondly I had a question on the [Amex] partnership that you announced recently. I did want to just understand how you are planning on leveraging that and can you list the [Amex] partnership, get to that closed loop for the carts that you would be working with them on to a greater degree than you even have?","Richard Davis","","Yes, this is Richard. It\u2019s a marketing and sponsorship partnership for our customers on the high wealth category who have many times said that they have both cards in their wallet. They've got the U.S. Bank Flex card but they also have the [Amex] card. We also wanted to recognized this, I am not trying to get into their close loop, so it's not a transaction activity, it\u2019s not a system activity for U.S. Bank, it\u2019s more of a brand. So, you will still have the U.S. Bank branded [Amex] card for our top customers. It will have the ability to have the very high end treatment that an [Amex] customer receives but also be able to do brand U.S. Bank and receive some of the products and services they receive now as our top customers. So, it\u2019s a little bit more than branding but it\u2019s a lot less than anything more sophisticated than you might think as it relates to trying to work with close\u00a0loop or trying to change tracks if you will. ","We'll still a VISA MasterCard originating company but for this very small core customers. We actually think sometimes if you can\u2019t beat them, join them and Amex has a particularly exceptional product, it\u2019s the very highest end for services even in and above the credit card needs of customer. So, I think it was the right thing to do. It\u2019s not going to move the needle a lot but we're satisfied with the early stage announcement and I think our customers are happy with this as well.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then just while we are on card I know that on your website, you are very vocal about the fact that you're tracking fraud and everything else but you\u2019ve also been very vocal as a firm with regard to your taking fraud prevention forward, so I don\u2019t know if you could comment at all on what you're thinking, in a post target world around moving towards tokenization or EMV.","Richard Davis","Yes, I am a big supporter of progress in all those protective areas, also as being mature to the clearing house we're working on tokenization and cloud use for some of those protections and encryption. I guess what I would say to you is it\u2019s disappointing that with the retailer fraud that's occurred, it certainly is a burden on the banks because we have most of our customers as well that are affected if they use, in this case, some of those merchants that were affected. ","And so we are moving to reproduce all new cards for those customers. We are doing it through methodical process were those who had fraud or we know they had fraud, or where they had fraud, they\u2019re getting card reissues immediately, both credit and debit to the extent that we eventually track every customer who we think could have been affected by that time in period. We are reissuing all of those cards. We are not announcing it as a broad event, we\u2019re just indicating to our customers that as it goes we want to make sure they are protected and that their information is not in the open, say a year from now, when people aren't paying attention.","More germane to the issue Betsy, is one of my concerns is chip at EMV is not necessarily the end point, it's just another step in the journey. And as you get to mobile banking, and you look at cloud, and the other encryptions, it will be interesting to see whether or not we have to stop now and go back to chip EMV or if we really want to leap frog that and get to the more, I think provocative outcome which is going to be the necessary standard, not many years from now. And whether the marketplace reacts and how they react to the breaches that have occurred at some of the more recent merchants is going to be yet to be seen. ","So banks will be at the ready, you know as the bank merchant partnership; merchants would have to change their terminals and their willingness to spend the money to have chip receiving cards. We have to reissue cards on chip. Every one of our customers who travels overseas has been getting a chip card for years, because it's necessary over in Europe and some places in Canada. But I think that story we told in the next couple of months. Ask me again in April and we'll just see how it's settled but I think there is one [small dot] that says let's spend all of our energy on the more sophisticated endpoint of mobile banking and cloud encryption. ","Others might say we haven\u2019t got the time to waste, let's jump to the chip step and we will end up getting to the other point a later. We'll be open to either one, because we're acquirer or an issuer or deep in the conversation. There is other alternative even that I haven\u2019t mentioned. But we'll do this right, whatever the marketplace wants and as banks have proven with merchants together we'll get the right answer because we all want customers supposedly.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","","Okay. In terms of timeframe and spend from your perspective, is it something that is obviously ongoing. People had said that maybe the chip tokenization would be a three to five year timeframe. Do you feel like that might be a little bit sooner and would we see any of this in the expense line or is it too small? ","Richard Davis","Yes chip has a deadline of 2015, so it would be in the next couple of years. It's more expensive to issue a chip card for sure than a magnetic stripe, but it's not going to break anybody's back. And the receipt is probably more of an issue on the merchant side where it will have to reprogram all of their terminals, now I'm talking small businesses as well as the large merchants, where they would have to change our terminals. And some merchants buy those terminals, so that's a fixed cost you have to change. Many others would lease those terminals which might be a bit easier for that transition. Those are the kind of fundamentals that will come through the economic review of this. But you and I both know there will be a political and maybe a regulatory view of this that might change those outcomes and either force one solution or another based on the concerns from politicians and the protection of citizens or regulators' concerns for our consumer protection. ","I think there is a lot of studying to be done because of the simple answer doesn\u2019t just go from one to the other because that\u2019s only one step in a longer journey. But I do think in the next 90 days we'll have a better sense as it's settled and people decide where the risk is. ","I'll close with this though, to the extent that other information is not card related, gets taken or the fraudulent operator have new information access to things that are more than card related, we should all be quite concerned, because at the end of the day the banks will bear the burden in most cases. 14 months from now, one of my customers has been a victim of some fraud that's [going to involve] data that was taken from a card situation. And all of a sudden my fraud levels are higher in the second quarter 2015.","I probably will never be able to trace it to any one circumstance that will just be a higher environmental risk, if you like having more breakage off the shelves. So we all have to be much smarter and we are spending a lot of time outside of the card area, watching for fraud behaviors and watching and monitoring activities to protect customers. ","What that means that is more customers are going to be have to be tolerant when a really good bank has the protection and first and foremost that says I just discovered fraud or potential fraud. I disrupted your environment for a minute because I want to either change your account number or stop the transaction because I feel like you\u2019re going to be a victim if we don\u2019t stop it now. I think the recent episode over the last couple of months might help consumers realize that their precaution really is worth a bit of disruption if it protects them in the long term. So there is some good learning that will come out of this and I think banks and merchants should work together. And you have in the past probably more in the future to protect customers and they can feel we all have their best interest. It could be a while.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbach of Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbach - Credit Suisse","Thanks. The question that I had is, you talked about -- you\u2019ve been able to improve the capital position of the company based upon the earnings, even though you returned 65% of capital during the full year 2013. How should we think about that, I meant is that -- should that number be higher as we go forward, I mean given that you\u2019ve been able to actually do both?","Richard Davis","We've said for as long as I actually can remember that we would return 30% to 40% of our earnings in the form of dividends and 30% to 40% in the form of buybacks. 2013, the full year was 71% the quarter was 65%, and so we\u2019re in that low level range. I will also say to you as a leading follow up question is, as it relates to one of those two measures is currently limited by the federal reserve CCAR process at 30% and at this point we\u2019re going to continue to abide by those general rules and follow the guidance that we\u2019ve been given to stay at that perimeter, it\u2019ll be a time I hope that the fed will say certain banks have earned their permission to go back to along the dividends to be what they think is reasonable and supportable. In that case we probably would float above that 30% level but we\u2019re not eager to do it at this stage and we have plenty of room and opportunity on the buyback side and still stay within that range at 60-80%. ","We like the 20% left for ourselves because we do be expect to be an acquirer, we expect to take opportunities when something comes along, particularly in trust or payment and I\u2019ll say there\u2019s a great deal of innovation and R&D that we\u2019re spending money on that, much of which will eventually come to bear fruit, some of it will prove that we\u2019ll learn what doesn\u2019t work, but you actually in this environment now, banks that used to be innovators and in this environment you want us to be, you want us to be the leaders of fast followers and work with a lot of other companies and expertise that we might not necessarily have ever had in our legacy. So 60 to 80 is right in the sweet spot, where its 71, and I think right now where we are is a good indicator of where we'll be for 2014.","Andy Cecere","And Moshe, I would add as we were at 86 in the third quarter, dropping at 88, a good part of that increase was a reduction in the pension debit which as a reduction to capital, the pension debit went down because rates went up. So that's a onetime phenomenon and I would expect this in 2014 sort to be in that 8.5 range for most of the year.","Moshe Orenbach - Credit Suisse","Got you, just kind of as a follow up on the idea, Richard, you touched on the idea of acquisitions and you\u2019ve actually announced a branch acquisition recently, what\u2019s the environment like for those types of acquisitions?","Andy Cecere"," ","You know they\u2019re still one up, one up mostly I mean, we are always interested in deepening our debt where we have a branch network, so we like branches as you know and we are going to be probably a net grower, small but net grower in the next year. It might not be in exactly the same place, we might be in partnerships with universities or grocery stores or things, but we like adding branches and the opportunity to double down like in Chicago is worthwhile. If any of our 25 states currently had an opportunity like that we would be interested. I want you to know, I\u2019m not interested in jumping states or getting a handful of branches in a state where you really have not critical mass or even in an NSA where you can\u2019t build enough distinctions to call out market leadership. ","I also don\u2019t see us doing a full bank transaction unless the transaction is still attractive because of the risks I\u2019ve talked about before that align with picking up the problems and the legacy issues that you may not ever be able to know at due diligence and you simply can\u2019t price for. So I think deals like branch related end market transactions and the two deals we highlighted in our earnings call here today, fund services or even European businesses for payments or trust are things you can expect to see more of and we do have a number of toes in the water in those opportunities that none will move the needle but over time, they add up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Conner at the Georgia Bank.","Matt O\u2019Conner - Georgia Bank","As you look at the payments business and the fee is worth about 3% year over year, obviously the government fees was a drag, but looking towards 2014 it should be much less of a drag from here. How should we think about the revenue growth in that combined segment, and I am thinking just the payment fees overall much as the government fees.","Andy Cecere","Right, good question, now so first this quarter you know we -- a lot of the merchant activities were in the same store sales and same store sales were up about 3% domestically and about 4% globally. So Europe actually outdid the US in that regard. We were way down this year by the government side of the equation as we said in the CARR, government spend was down about 17%, 18% year over year. I think that will begin to stabilize next year and I think you should expect the total payments category to get closer to what is our normal long term growth there but not quite to that level till same store sales has to increase a point or two. So the anchor that we saw this year on a corporate payment I think will begin to diminish as we get into \u201914.","Richard Davis","Matt it's Richard, just as a reminder you know, the total payment space for us is about a quarter of our revenue, corporate payments is about 20% of that quarter and government is about 20% of that space. So it\u2019s not a big driver but we like it, we\u2019re going to stay with it. I don\u2019t believe that we have the same kind of future trajectory, a negative trajectory that we\u2019ve seen in the last two years of both the sequester and the ending of the work, so for us, we'll be glad we stayed with it, we had it carried across the trends and at the same time mortgages, fees were falling but I think that they both have some stability going into 2014 and I think we\u2019ll be glad we stuck with it, but it\u2019s not as big as it looks, it's more of a headline but if we\u2019re staying with it, because I think it starts to turn the corner in \u201914.","Matt O\u2019Conner - Georgia Bank","Okay then just separately, the Chicago branch deal, have you talked about the -- either the potential earnings impact from that or I\u2019m sure there's both some cost savings and some investments that you might be making, how all that nets out.","Andy Cecere","For 2014, Matt, it\u2019s not material to our number.","Matt O\u2019Conner - Georgia Bank","Okay.","Richard Davis"," ","But there\u2019ll be a little branch consolidation, but for that it\u2019s really an opportunity to be more present in a really big city and what I\u2019m hoping for is that the synergies to the 100 branches we have will be as powerful as the ability to insight kind of new growth of the 100 that we're picking up and it will be just be a little more pervasive across Chicago and it\u2019s a great market for us, we've got great leadership there and we've actually kind of been managing over our sleeves a little bit in terms of our exposure, our marketing and our visibility. And I think we now have a chance to catch up to it and if I can grow more there I\u2019ll continue to do so.","Matt O\u2019Conner - Georgia Bank","I guess the infrastructure that you have now in the market and you\u2019ve been doing that it\u2019s all scalable, there is not going to be an expense kind of ramp up as you, okay.","Andy Cecere"," ","No, there will not be. ","Richard Davis"," ","Yes, so, I was trying to say we\u2019ve pretty much all the fixed costs were already there, we are just going to add something nice to make it more visible.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR.","Paul Miller - FBR","Thank you very much. Going back to your loan portfolio, one of the areas that you\u2019ve really done a great job as your residential mortgages and I believe most of them are jumbos, can you talk a little bit about and I think they are arms, am I correct? How is the jumbo markets because we\u2019re hearing that it\u2019s very overheated definitely coming out of the west coast where a large banks out there competing very aggressively in that market?","Andy Cecere"," ","So, Paul, actually most of our growth is in a product called smart refinance in the high quality branch originated refinance product for our core customers and that is what\u2019s driving and a lot of that is a short, it's not a 30-year product, it\u2019s a shorter product. We are seeing a phenomenon occur just like you\u2019re seeing in the total mortgage business refinancing activity is starting to go down. So that volume will start go down but on the flipside home equity line of credit activity is increasing. So those are the trends I think you\u2019ll start to see into the next few quarters.","Bill Parker","Yes and we are active in the jumbo space, we have done all long and it\u2019s pretty much started it towards our private client type customer and many of those are arms.","Paul Miller - FBR","So is that mainly coming out of your private client product mix what I guess.","Bill Parker","A good chunk of it, some of it comes out through the branches in states like California where you have such high home values.","Paul Miller - FBR","And then on your securities portfolio, you talk about that you want to grow that to about $85 billion, what type duration with a new product, with the new stuff coming on are you shooting for?","Andy Cecere"," ","While we\u2019re keeping at pretty short about half floaters half fixed and you can think in the term of three and three half years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","The question just big picture as far as revenue growth and operating leverage, slide 6 of the deck shows that the year-over-year revenue growth has still been easily negative largely because the mortgage comps and the payments, but as we look ahead and Richard to your point about getting the efficiency ratio back down towards the low 50s, can you help us understand the dynamic? Do you think, how close are we to the point of getting that year-over-year comp and revenues back deposit and then how also do you think expenses can kind of trend along with that?","Richard Davis","So you know we do kind of manage the company, the governor is revenue, and when we put our profit plan together late last year, we worked from the bottoms up and we figured out what the revenue growth would be and as I\u2019ve told you before, the plan would be the expenses will be less than that. So I can tell you that our intent is to have positive operating leverage, I won\u2019t take one quarter time because we\u2019re fairly heavy second and third quarter positive and then without government in the fourth quarter we have that's fall off in quarter one and tougher quarter just because of New Year expenses. But we are looking for positive operating leverage first and foremost Ken, in 2014. ","Now, the other thing I said the quote for that though is since we\u2019re not expecting revenue growth to be overlay robust, we expect to be at least as good if not more what you\u2019ve seen in the last year or two. We\u2019re going to watch our expenses and we have a good run rate of expenses to start with. We've been part of some regulatory consent order to mortgage which was a fairly expensive task that we\u2019ve now used some of those monies and reallocated to other compliance activities.","We are not seeing an undue increase in expenses in order to run the company run safely, but at the same token, but for merit increases and necessary capital expenditures finishing what we\u2019ve started. This will be a year that we've left some of our investments follow through just on fruition and we won\u2019t start a lot of new things, that\u2019s U.S. Bank's way of logging expenses. They don\u2019t cut expenses because we'd never get over our sleeves. We don\u2019t go out and create an environment where we have consultants come in and give us a program and start reducing people, our working force.","We typically just watch every single 30-day and make sure we don\u2019t do something that the revenue won\u2019t allow us to. So you have to trust us. We\u2019re going to continue to deliver positive operating leverage because it's how we grow the company, it's how you end up making the success that you can count on predictable. But as each month goes, we\u2019ll adjust as we always do but I think we\u2019re expecting revenue to be strong enough to allow for some expense growth. So we\u2019re going to watch our nickels and dimes until this environment is surely on its feet and there is a recovery well. And we don\u2019t see that quite yet so we\u2019re just going to watch everything we do.","I really appreciated the questions early on regarding the non-bottom line impact of the accounting changes we talked about with our -- some of our tax credits because we want you all to know that\u2019s not material, it\u2019s not all impactful to bottom line and it\u2019s more of a landscape they should record it for. We are committed to staying low in 50s and efficiency because we\u2019re going to let revenue growth faster than expenses, so nothing has changed, I guess I am trying to say. But for this little bit of blip, we\u2019re going to continue to deliver for you all but, I'll say as over a year probably not this one, when revenue is going to really take off, for a lot of reasons, and while the expenses were a little higher than they might this year but they are still well below that and the way to you all\u2019s heart is to keep efficiency positive and make sure operating leverage is the way you drive the bottom line and I am feeling pretty good about it.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","","Okay, great. And just a question within the expenses, and one little one on the tax thing, you mentioned, Andy, the benefit in the pension side on the capital side. Are you going to see a pension benefit and is that built into your expectation for the first quarter expenses for this year?","Andy Cecere","Yes and yes.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","","All right, can you help us understand the magnitude of that?","Andy Cecere","So, the increase that we saw from \u201912 to \u201913 is going to almost go back to the level it was in \u201912 in terms of the pension expense. It went up 140 million or so and it will go down about that same range.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","","Okay. And then just on the last thing on the taxing. So the minority interest piece, I don\u2019t think you talked about that. That kind of had been running at a minus 40. So does that now also continue at the same plus 15 range given those changes?","Andy Cecere","Yes, there will be no further change in the minority interest piece.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","","So it is kind of safe from here. Okay, great. And credit -- your comment about first quarter charge-offs being up and reserve releases a little bigger this quarter. Can you just talk to us about how do you continue to expect any more reserve leads to go ahead?","Andy Cecere","Yes, we do -- we had strong improvement in credit in the fourth quarter, and anticipate we\u2019ll have continued improvement in credit in the first quarter. Losses will be up a little bit really not because of the charge-off side but really because of the wholesale recovery side. We\u2019ve had some significant wholesale recoveries in the last few quarters, and it\u2019s unlikely that those will continue.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson & Humphrey.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","","Just a couple of questions please. The first is your GAAP assets look like they went up a little less than 1% but your Basel III risk-weighted assets went up a little over 1.5. Can you just explain what accounted for the difference?","","Andy Cecere","Commitments, off balance-sheet commitments.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Got it. Primarily lending commitments I assuming?","Andy Cecere","Correct. And as we talked about the fact that our commitment levels are growing more rapidly than our outstandings, which is a good thing in the long-term, and on a 10% annualized basis and that\u2019s a principle driver.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Great, thank you. And then you and several other institutions have announced the discontinuation of deposit advanced products. What -- how should we think about the influence of that on either the fee or NII line items?","Richard Davis","","This is Richard, I will go first. I will let Andy talk about the financial impact. It\u2019s not significant, first of all, but I am disappointed that the product has gone because it was probably the most popular customer product I think I ever had as a banker. In that it was very transparent, was very clear but it simply just didn\u2019t meet the [cadence] of the regulatory view of total API on a certain calculation and the general sense that people otherwise are being harmed. So of course we moved along and followed the guidance and we\u2019re now ending the product even at this month and we\u2019ll wind it down in the next couple.","What's I am more interested in is trying to find a replacement of such products so that we can find something for those consumers that will otherwise stay in the protected banking industry where there is over sight in protections which I support greatly. And we\u2019re working now with the regulators primarily the OCC to see if we can develop some kind of a replacement product. It\u2019s too new to have that so we haven\u2019t got that built into our plan. So as we really expect there will be a second half loss and most of the impact falls to spread income, but I\u2019ll leave Andy to give a little more dimension.","Andy Cecere","Right, so as Richard said, we would expect very little impact in the first half of the year given that our -- are going to continue with our current customers until mid-year. In the second half of the year the product earns approximately $50 million a quarter because through a lot of these are net interest income. And that would be the impact if the product in of itself on the way but as Richard mentioned we\u2019re working on alternatives and we\u2019ll keep you updated on the impacts as we work through those alternatives.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks, and just following on, and this is my last question. Given the influence of this change, as well as the liquidity guidance that you provided earlier in the call, how should we now be thinking about the net interest margin over the next several quarters?","Andy Cecere","Yes, the net interest margin absent the CAA issue that we just talked about and the securities bill is relatively stable. So the principle change will be the securities bill. The securities bill impacts net interest margin the rate has no impact on net interest income at all. It comes down with fairly neutral spreads. So we\u2019ll continue to update you on that. I would expect the build in the first quarter to impact just by about 3 basis points similar to what you saw in the fourth quarter.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Murray of ISI.","Keith Murray - ISI","","Could you just touch on the strength that you\u2019ve had in the commercial products this quarter and the sustainability of that?","Andy Cecere","So it\u2019s across many categories. We had a good quarter in high grade underwriting. We had a good quarter in order of credit activity, FX, just across many categories. I attribute this back to some of the investments we've made over the years in terms of building those capabilities both with people, products and services and technologies. So that is a real positive story for us and I would expect it to continue into 2014.","Richard Davis","Every once in a while you get that moment you can actually prove something and so here we were three or four years ago talking about taking our wholesale bank and moving it from regional to national, creating scale, hiring people in New York and Charlotte. And you'll say, well one year we see the benefits, this is a great example [indiscernible] of where that\u2019s starting to show up and coming in more consistent basis. We\u2019ve always been a bank to a large number of large customers, Fortune 100 customers but we always didn\u2019t have all the products and services. The last few years we\u2019ve got a chance to become more important in the syndicated line of credit, we moved up in their view of being a trusted partner and now we get the fee businesses as well more often than we used to and that\u2019s exactly where this kind of benefit shows up years later.","Keith Murray - ISI","Okay, thanks. And then can you give us some color on the magnitude of any equity gains for this quarter?","Andy Cecere","It was minimal. So if you look at the other income line you actually see an improvement but that was more a function of the third quarter having some negatives, the fourth quarter was relatively neutral.","Keith Murray - ISI","Okay, thanks. And then just lastly on the repurchase reserve and repurchase cost going forward. How should we think about this \"more normal run rate\" for that line item?","Andy Cecere","Yes. So we have the 753 million with Freddie here in the fourth quarter, and we\u2019re down to a level that -- we're probably still a little bit higher than what we would be over the long term but we\u2019re starting to get to a level that I think is more normal in terms of historic level. So we\u2019re not quite there but it\u2019s going to be a material change on a go forward basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio of KBW.","Chris Mutascio - KBW","Andy, first I\u2019ve got a quick question for you on expense given the guidance for a first quarter being closer in line with previous third quarter, does that imply that there was a good bit of pull forward of business development and marketing expenses that occur this quarter?","Andy Cecere","No, not necessarily a pull forward, it\u2019s just a seasonal impact that we typically see. So if you look at the expense increase from third quarter to fourth quarter, about half of it was the tax related and then about half of it was things like legal and professional and marketing and expense. And if you look at our history Chris you\u2019ll see that the fourth quarter is seasonally higher in those categories and then seasonally comes down in the first quarter.","Chris Mutascio - KBW","Okay, that\u2019s fair. Bill, my question for you is, could we see, going back to the reserves for a little bit and I think I ask question almost every time I see you, can we see the pace of reserve releases actually pick up from here? It\u2019s been pretty steady around $30 million to $35 million or so. I mean I had a bank yesterday that released more reserves in terms of taking the reserve ratio down in one quarter than you guys have done in four quarters. And BofA now has a lower reserve ratio than you do. So I was kind of wondering given the continuing improvement in credit quality, could the pace of the reserve releases pick up in \u201914?","Bill Parker","Yes, I\u2019ll speak for our bank, right. I don\u2019t think so. What we\u2019re down, what we\u2019re left with is really improvement in residential mortgage and home equity. Those are really the only two portfolios where there is still work to be done in terms of the fallout from the recession. So absent that I would say we\u2019re steady as you go for the moment but there is probably not loss of reserve release.","Richard Davis","This is Richard. One thing I hope you guys like about is we\u2019re not that interesting and volatile and it's a great example. We didn\u2019t have anywhere near the same credit issues in the first place. We didn\u2019t have to build the reserves in the first place and we\u2019ve been very steady and methodical and thoughtful all in line with regulator views and accounting views to make sure that we\u2019re not living on and counting on these reserve releases and you shouldn\u2019t either because it\u2019s not sustainable. I think you\u2019ll see a lot more of what we\u2019ve done in the past it's how we get to a point of stability where all of a sudden and we\u2019re all going to start having reserve releases. And in a forward view there should be a day when banks have growing loans, balance sheet is growing and we\u2019re adding to our reserves at a level equal to and higher than the current day because those are for future loan charge-offs. So I think we\u2019re probably closest to most of new basic inflection point but this year we'll have a little bit more but we haven\u2019t relied on it because at this point we\u2019re not counting on it to get through this year or the next one.","Chris Mutascio - KBW","Rich I kind of agree with you, but it just gets a little frustrating when I see bank stocks go up on reserve releases and you guys are more prudent going for the full cycle and you don\u2019t get credit for the quality of earnings but in any event that\u2019s a\u2026","Richard Davis","I hadn\u2019t noticed.","Chris Mutascio - KBW","If I can just follow up one with Bill, so from your comments it seems like the new belief that reserve for loan ratio for your individual bank will be higher than it was previous to the crisis whether it\u2019s from the re-regulatory process or what have you, so whether it was one in a quarter to 150 previous to the cycle we\u2019re going to be somewhat higher than that?","Bill Parker","Right, the first thing is you have to look at the difference and mix so and we do have a fairly large card portfolio relative to the size of our balance sheet relative to our peers. So that\u2019s obviously going to keep parts a little higher. And then again as Richard said we just didn\u2019t go up as much so we\u2019re just not going to go down as much.","Richard Davis","With that Chris over the course of time 1.53 charge-off right, we think over the course of time the long time this bank is a 1% charge-off and with FAS 114 in other areas we want to make sure we stay aligned with that and for investors we think to the extent we can stay within the balance of all the rules and not create these volatilities that were occurred at giving away too much than build it back when we don\u2019t need it. But again the line with rules and regulation, we would love to stay as steady as we can and have the appropriate level. It actually serves another form of capital if you have a good reserve portfolio for loans that could go bad but for reasons we all know, I don\u2019t think any bank is under where there are long term run rate will beneath them we know in the last few years if we didn\u2019t take risks as an industry on loans when we shouldn\u2019t have, but we probably have record low position and we are going to start building that back. So don\u2019t anyone be disappointed when charge-off rates start to move up, provision releases stop and provision build starts, that\u2019s actually a pretty good sign that we're all getting back to doing what we\u2019re supposed to do which is make loans to qualified people and every once in a while one doesn\u2019t get paid back.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scinicariello of UBS. ","Steve Scinicariello - UBS","I just want to circle back to the Chicago branch acquisition for a moment. I'm just curious as you kind of look at the long-term potential opportunity there, do you see the greatest potential benefit over the long-term from ramping up loan growth or cross-selling and further penetrating a customer base in that market? Just kind of curious how you look at that long-term potential benefit, where is the biggest source of opportunity for you? ","Richard Davis ","Steve, good question. If we had had our druthers we started from the bottom we would always be top one, two or three in every market in terms of consumer, small business and wealth management. First of all because you're pervasive enough to matter, you are in someone\u2019s life, at where they are near their work, near their home, in between and now on mobile technology; you are pervasive to them, that\u2019s our goal. I am not kind of get out of markets where I am sixth or seventh, that we are still good for the shareholders but I would love to move up in every market to top three. ","Chicago is going to take a while, so we\u2019re are going to move up now at seventh or eighth. In terms of branch distribution we might get in the top five and we can find other deals to couple together maybe more grocery partners and things we could get into the top three or four, that\u2019s really what we are headed towards, then the scale matters. Right, so every time I run an ad in the Chicago Tribune and we do something on mobile technology or Chicago land we do a sponsorship of something and partner with the city or some of the suburbs, then all this go so much further and so much deeper and so much better. Employees are more enthused, we get more of a kind of a reputation build. And it\u2019s one of the greatest cities in the country, so it\u2019s also worth investing there for a long-term because it\u2019s pretty loyal market. ","So, for us it\u2019s a step towards getting into top most pervasive companies and the two or three really, really big companies that are legacy and we are legacy in a couple of other big markets and legacy always has to worry that they are going to get old and become part of a kind of an old-fashioned paradigm and we are going to try to protect ourselves when we are really big, and when we are not big we are going to be that really vicious competitor that comes up and tries to reset the paradigm and get people to pay attention to our self. This deal was perfect on all accounts, financially it just accrues because its scale and because it allows us to extend in a market that\u2019s going to grow because Chicago will grow.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS","Well makes total sense but I know you said you are more than willing to look at more of these types of transactions in other markets. The question I have is do you think you might get the opportunity? Just curious what your thoughts might be on that.","Richard Davis ","I know more -- I think we're considered a disciplined buyer and so the deals you will never know are the ones that came and went because we said there is no way we are going to pay that for that. But every once in a while one comes along where the motivations of the seller and our interest is high, the price is good for both parties including all the shareholders and this is one of those that came together. So, we if those circumstances align again, we'll do more of these deals because we think it\u2019s the right way to take advantage, especially in an unfinished kind of unsettled market where until things are normal again, some people have the need to shed assets, others like us will be interested in acquiring assets where it make senses and kind of jumpstart the organic trip that otherwise happens in normal time. So, if we don\u2019t do another deal, the branches will be fine, but if more come along on these terms we'll take them.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of CLSA.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","I was trying to gauge your conviction level that loan growth is coming back. On the one hand, Richard, you're expressing optimism that we've heard from several other bank CEOs on the other hand what I think I heard you guys say is that loan utilization declined down to 23%, that your customers aren't drawing down their deposits, which is a leading indicator, that you don't expect a whole lot of loan growth the next quarter or two and that you yourselves are still watching your nickels and dimes a lot given some uncertainty. So I know you've been more conservative than most over the years and we're all trying to figure out the pace of loan growth. What sort of leading indicator is sentiment or is this just informal? Is this a gut feel? Just any other color on loan growth. ","Richard Davis ","Yes, so Mike, Erika\u2019s question number one, I think I said it was a tale of two halves and I was confessing that it's solely sentiment from my customers and my bankers that tells me that things are better than they have been. It is not on the balance sheet, it is not evidential at all which is why we do not agree with you that first deposit get used, then lines that are already outstanding get used and then new lines get created and we haven\u2019t seen any of that. So, it is purely sentiment and perhaps it\u2019s a lot of just pent-up long overdue demand to get things move moving. ","But sentiment is always the leading indicator, right and so I think as I said before, Spring will tell this story more than most springs and the second half will be what the sentiment yields as will results or it will be nothing more than sentiment and we'll be talking in April and again in July as seen -- well at least we see, at least consistent loan growth of the 6% plus annualized loan growth we've been doing it through the whole recession, the only reason we can\u2019t keep doing it. But at the same time you\u2019ve heard us before we are not going to compete on term, on structure we are going to compete on rate and we can continue to do that and the rates are seeing a little bit at compression. So, we'll be thoughtful about it but, you repeated what I said which is its simply sentiment, I don\u2019t have evidence yet. And when the evidence starts, the best news I'll have for you is the deposits are drawing down, lines are getting used, and people are starting to show an interest and be involved. ","I said before too that I do think that perhaps different than almost any other recovery coming from a recession that people will not be -- the consumer that blinks first, it will be the businesses, meaning that the consumer is not going to evidence like it always has a real strong sense that we are now ready, get ready we are going to buy. I think the businesses are going to have to find a way to incentivise that interest, they can incentivise the product at creations or innovation or pricing and start pulling consumers across to start investing. As long as they invest consumers are starting to feel better and the products are more interesting and the pricing is more attractive, I think that\u2019s the magic that will pull this one out, that for the first time I think businesses will drive through this recovery, it really has a lot to do with their behaviours, in and above whatever spend and we are hearing from consumers.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","And one follow up, you talked about the trade-off between price and loan growth and as a low cost producer you can probably afford to charge lower rates on the loans, but you have seen compression across the board on your loans. Are you close to a tipping point where you say, hey, we shouldn\u2019t charge a whole lot less or as long as you\u2019re growing some NII, it\u2019s okay?","Richard Davis"," ","I would say our pricing is going to be relatively stable Mike on a go forward basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities."," ","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Just, I guess to focus on one area of loan growth specifically it looked like commercial real estate outstandings were rising at a faster pace in the fourth quarter than they have on a year-over-year basis. We've heard from a number of competitors particularly in the southeast that that is a growing area of competition. What\u2019s your sense in your markets as to the demand for commercial real estate opportunities and looking into 2014 and how competitive has the pricing gone?","Richard Davis"," ","I will start with demand. I mean we have seen pretty good demand on the coast and in the southeast as you mentioned, that was our -- the southeast was our fastest growing market in the fourth quarter. And we have heard from our clients that they are seeing more demand for their product whether it\u2019s storage or build to suite, more than just the multifamily that we\u2019ve seen in the past several quarters. So, we are seeing a pickup in demand which is positive and then on the pricing, I think to the extent there has been pricing compression, I think that\u2019s mostly behind us. I think the pricing is fairly stable right now. So, we saw good demand in the fourth quarter and expect to continue next year.","","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Then if I can follow up with a question on the capital market side, Richard you\u2019ve been obviously been quite correctly optimistic particularly for your own business over the last couple of years; as we head into a higher rate cycle, there is concerns I think across the broader market that demand for fixed income underwriting may come down a little bit, demand potentially conversely for equity underwriting may increase. How are you looking at that business heading into 2014 in terms of some of the bigger picture trends that are affecting interest rates? ","Richard Davis"," ","You know Matt, I think; I still see \u201914 looking a lot like \u201913. You\u2019ve got leverage lending and middle market activity still pretty high. You\u2019ve got syndicated issuance still getting better over time primarily refinancing and that refinancing as opposed to new transactions creates a bit of a downward pressure on yields. We've got loan growth looking seasonally best in the western markets and particularly seasonally high including some of the retail groups. ","As it relates to more traditional lending, that\u2019s where we would see and expect it by the way everything is performing as we thought it was just kind of slow annuity like, as it relates to the more sophisticated transactions what we are seeing in the capital markets are particularly a deal event, action oriented items where someone wants to buy another company or make a particular transaction in the market to create some additional financing and we are there now where we didn\u2019t use to be. And we can handle those activities but kind of following the conversation with Mike, the sentiment isn\u2019t necessarily any stronger than it was to generate a sense that that\u2019s going to be different in \u201914 but it's not worse than it was in \u201913. ","It just seems to be kind of a slow steady part of that recovery and I think the very high end of the market reflects exactly what the low end is which is careful, thoughtful, event driven by taking advantage when the chance comes along. And the whole economy is still uneven, so there are people who have something they want to get rid of and there are others who find value in it and that\u2019s kind of where we are until we see something more predictable. Bill, you want to add to that?","","Bill Parker","Well, I think, you know in terms of the capital markets activity, I think \u201913 was obviously a very good year for refinancing and higher rates may moderate that a little bit, but there is still a lot of acquisition activity and that will clearly generate bond activity. So, we anticipate that we'll benefit from that. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Guggenheim. "," ","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Partners","Good morning, as you can imagine most of the questions have been asked, but I have two technical questions I wanted to follow up on. You had mentioned in the tax line that there was a state benefit I think. What was the magnitude of that this quarter?","Andy Cecere"," ","It impacted the rate by about 1%, Marty.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Partners","Okay. And then lastly on the mortgage repurchase reserves, there was a change in reserve of about $30 million. Was that geography and that\u2019s a benefit or a reduction of expenses that\u2019s probably in other expenses, is that correct?","Richard Davis"," ","It\u2019s actually an increase in mortgage revenue and it\u2019s a reassessment of reserve levels every quarter and it\u2019s just that what we think is the appropriate level and that\u2019s reflected in mortgage revenue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush of NAB Research, LLC.","","Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC","Question, you\u2019ve had a great deal of success over the past few years with your loan production offices outside of your traditional banking markets. And could you just speak to what percentage of your commercial revenues are now coming out of those offices and are there plans for expansion in to other markets?","Richard Davis"," ","Nancy, do you mean for the middle market or in corporate?","Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC","Yes.","","Richard Davis"," ","Okay. So we have, what we call an adjacent state program. So for instance we have our folks in one market managing Michigan and managing Pennsylvania, we have others managing Indiana and managing Georgia. And that\u2019s worked quite well for us. So what we\u2019ve done is we have a local in footprint management team that has people also in adjacent space where we have enough of a reputation, a halo, we have people know who we are. At the middle market level if you don\u2019t have branches you have to be valuable to these folks in a different way because you have to get them up on more than cash management, treasury management, products and some of the servicing it would be more technical and more mobile.","That\u2019s how we\u2019re having success there. It\u2019s probably 4% to 5% of our total. It\u2019s not a very big number. It\u2019s not intended to be because I do think it gives certain level as you get to the point where you have branches. On the larger end we can do business in all 50 states because the corporate customers, it\u2019s not even in the first three questions of whether or not you have branches nearby, they\u2019re not looking for that from a -- and so we\u2019re a full on national provider in both corporate and commercial real estate.","But as it relates to middle market, it\u2019s probably 4% to 5% impact on our total, and unless and until we were to find a very large branch acquisition in an adjacent space it\u2019s going to stay that way because we are just going to really drill down where people knows us best and have the ability if they want us to use our services on the ground.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran of Autonomous Research.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research USA","Hi, good morning, just a couple of quick follow ups, on the commitment growth you saw I know every business is different, every line is different. But is there any kind of historical rule of thumb you would look to for the typical lag between commitments turning into funded balances?","Bill Parker","Yes, this is Bill. I would say we sort of exceeded the historical lag. So normally by this time in an expansionary period you will be seeing these lines being drawn more than they are today. I mean some of our categories are down 10% in terms of normal utilization levels. So I think we\u2019re still all anticipating when this confidence turns into investment.","","Richard Davis","Yes, I would agree with that. And I would say that -- surprisingly they\u2019re all down a lot very much the same in terms of traditional history, commercial real estate which is the last in, last out in terms of problems and in terms of growth and that\u2019s probably the same in this cycle. But if you get anything from small business to commercial real estate specialty products through community banking, they\u2019re all down, in fact even more, I mean bill our collective utilization for the wholesale credits for this company was at 38% kind of level and we\u2019re at 23% and that\u2019s on well over $100 billion so that\u2019s in its own right is just a huge place built at the right we\u2019re in places we\u2019ve never been, there\u2019s nowhere to go but up but in the next month if we go down again we\u2019ll say one more time.","But I like the fact that it\u2019s pent up opportunity, it is even better, it\u2019s one step better than in an unknown line or loan at this stage because these are people paying for it, they\u2019re paying us to have first have a line, they want have the access to it, the fact they keep growing lines over 11% last year such that they are planning to do something and that kind of feeds my sentiment issue, my answer with Mike Mayo, which is actually that number get stronger, not weaker. So we\u2019ve got a lot of canaries in the mine, they\u2019re all chirping but nothing is happening yet.","","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research USA","That\u2019s very helpful. On the commercial products I guess as a follow up or clarification, when I think I heard you say '14 should look a lot like 13'. We should be working off the 13 full year base, not the run rate from the fourth quarter for that line item, right?","Richard Davis"," ","Correct.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research USA","And then lastly just as I think about capital and I guess it touches on the question I think Erika asked, RWA growth versus asset growth. I mean when I look at some of the other super-regionals who are in that advanced approach bucket, mega regionals, whatever you want to call them. RWAs have been falling even if assets have been growing for the past two to three quarters. And I wonder is that a pent up opportunity for U.S. Bank or because some of your peers have more punitive noninvestment grade securities and things like that, are they just reversing out of capital penalty you never had to begin with?","Andy Cecere"," ","I can\u2019t tell you what others are doing. I will tell you ours is pretty straight forward. First of all, while we\u2019re in advanced approach purchase bank the ratio we\u2019re giving you is a standardized approach because that is your binary constraint that is the lower ratio. So it\u2019s a pretty simple equation, it\u2019s basically commitments that are causing the off balance sheet growth. ","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Morning guys, two quick follow-ups. Andy on net interest income -- you mentioned the net interest margin outlook for the first quarter. Do you hope to grow the net interest income dollars, just the balance sheet still growing, but you might have some seasonality in terms of the account pressure I guess. What would be outlook for the net interest income dollars?","Andy Cecere","Good question John. All things been equal I would expect to be relatively stable, but the first quarter has two fewer days than the fourth quarter. And that in of itself cost us about $30 million - $35 million.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay -- otherwise you expect it to be flattish?","Andy Cecere","Pretty close, yes.","","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay and then on the expenses you gave the outlook for the first quarter, would you expect the expenses to be declining from the first quarter. In other words are there seasonal items that fight the first quarter expenses as well?","Andy Cecere","No, I would say the first quarter is sort of a normal quarter in terms of activity. There are some things that are higher like FICO expense, some things that are lower like legal and professional. But overall it's relatively representative.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. So to the extent the first quarter efficiency ratio it\u2019s below the -- it\u2019s really the seasonal pressure on some of the fee income lines?","Andy Cecere","Yes, the first quarter is a seasonally low quarter in terms of fees, particularly in payments business, card and merchant. It's the lowest quarter of the year.","Richard Davis","There is no holiday, we got the pay downs on the credit cards, so it's always our [weak company] quarter. But that\u2019s when things pick up in quarters two and three.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Kevin Barker of Compass Point.","Kevin Barker - Compass Point","Could you talk about the non-QM market? Do you expect to participate in it and if so do you expect it to have an incremental uptick in residential loan growth on your balance sheet?","Andy Cecere"," ","We are going to participate in the non-QM market and much of it is very similar to what we do today. So again we do offer today interest only loans to private client type customers. We do offer lower loan to value loans that might not meet the 43% debt to income in the QM. So, on a go forward basis it doesn\u2019t have a material impact on types of loans that we\u2019re going to be putting on in balance sheet.","Richard Davis"," ","That\u2019s right. And QM-related you're going to find, Kevin, that we really don\u2019t have any kind of impact at all to our origination.","Kevin Barker - Compass Point","Would you change anything about the product, whether it's term or rate in order to take into account the risk associated with non-QM lending?","Andy Cecere"," ","No, I mean we recognize the risk and we've mitigated it with either higher down payments in general wealthier customers that type of thing. So we believe that we have the offset built into the underwriting.","Kevin Barker - Compass Point","Thank you.","Judy Murphy","This is Judy back again.

Richard Davis, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker, are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s second quarter 2014 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of this slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our Web site at usbank.com. I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today\u2019s presentation, in our press release, and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on filed with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Richard.","Richard David","Thank you, Sean. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call. I\u2019ll begin our review of U.S. Banc\u2019s results with a summary of the quarter\u2019s highlights on Page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bancorp reported record income of $1.5 billion for the second quarter of 2014 or $0.78 per diluted common share. Total average loans grew year-over-year by 6.8% and 2% linked quarter. We experienced strong loan growth in total average deposits to 6% over the prior year and 1.9% linked quarter. Credit quality remains strong.","Total net charge-offs decreased by 11% from the prior year and rose modestly on a linked quarter basis. Non-performing assets, excluding covered assets, declined compared to both the prior year quarter and on a linked quarter basis. We continue to generate significant capital this quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated for Basel III standardized approach as a fully implemented was 8.9% at June 30.","We repurchased 15 million shares of common stock during the second quarter, which along with our dividends, resulted in a 75% return of earnings to our shareholders in the second quarter. Slide four provides you with a five quarter history of our performance metrics, and they continue to be among the best in the industry. Return on average assets in the second quarter was 1.6% and return on average common equity was 15.1%.","Moving to the graph on the right. You can see that this quarter\u2019s net interest margin was 3.27%, in line with our guidance. Our efficiency ratio for the second quarter was 53.1%. Excluding the impact of two notable items in the second quarter, our efficiency ratio was 51.3%. We expect this ratio will remain in the low 50s going forward as we continue to manage expenses in relation to revenue trends while continuing to invest-in and grow our businesses.","Turning to Slide five; the Company reported total net revenue in the second quarter of $5.2 billion, a 4.9% increase from the prior year. Excluding the impact of this quarter\u2019s Visa sale, total net revenue increased 0.5% from the prior year. The increase is mainly due to the higher net interest income as well as increases in a majority of fee revenue categories, partially offset by a reduction in mortgage banking revenue.","Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide six. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $15 billion or 6.8% year-over-year and 2% linked quarter. Overall, excluding covered loans, our run-off portfolio, average total loans grew by 8.3% year-over-year and 2.2% linked quarter. Once again, the increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average total commercial loans, which grew by 12.4% year-over-year and 5.9% over the prior quarter.","Total average commercial real-estate also increased over the prior quarters but the average loans growing by 6.9% year-over-year and 1.1% linked quarter.","Residential real-estate loans grew 10.5% year-over-year and 0.4% over the prior quarter. Average credit card loans increased 5.9% year-over-year and were flat on a linked quarter basis. Within the other retail loan categories, auto loans and leases were higher, both year-over-year and linked quarter, while average home equity lines and loans continued to decline. The rate of decline in this category, however, has slowed considerably over the past few quarters.","Total average revolving commercial and commercial real-estate commitments continue to grow at a fast pace, increasing year-over-year by 12.7% and 3.1% on a linked quarter basis. Line utilization increased slightly and was approximately 24% in the second quarter. Total average deposits increased $15 billion or 6% over the same quarter of last year. On a linked quarter basis, average deposits increased by 1.9% with growth in low cost savings deposits, particularly strong on a linked quarter basis.","Turning to Slide seven, and credit quality. Total net charge-offs declined 11% on a year-over-year basis and rose modestly on a linked quarter basis. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 0.58% in the second quarter. Non-performing assets, excluding covered assets, decreased by 1.6% on a linked quarter basis and 8.1% from the second quarter of 2013. During the second quarter, we released $25 million of reserves, $10 million less than the first quarter of 2014 and $5 million less than in the second quarter of 2013. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect net charge-offs and total non-performing assets to remain relatively stable in the third quarter of 2014.","Andy will now give you a few more details about our second quarter results.","Andy Cecere","Thanks, Richard. Slide eight gives you a view of our second quarter 2014 results versus comparable time periods. Our diluted EPS of $0.78 was $0.02 higher than the second quarter of 2013 and $0.05 higher than the previous quarter.","The key drivers of the Company\u2019s second quarter earnings are summarized on Slide nine. Second quarter results included two previously disclosed notable items. The Company reached the $200 million settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice to resolve their investigation into the endorsement of mortgage loans under the FHA\u2019s insurance program. Also on the quarter and prior to the settlement, the Company sold 3 million shares of Class B common stock of Visa resulting in a pretax gain of $214 million. Combined, these notable items had no impact to diluted earnings per common share for the second quarter.","Excluding these notable items, the Company achieved positive operating leverage, both on the year-over-year and the linked quarter basis. The $11 million or 0.7% increase in net income year-over-year was principally due to an increase in total net revenue and a lower provision for credit losses.","Non-interest income was up 2.7% year-over-year as an increase in average earning assets was partially offset by a decrease in the net interest margin. And $24 billion growth in average earning assets year-over-year included increases in average total loans as well as planned increases in the securities portfolio. Offsetting a portion of the growth in these categories was a $4 billion reduction in average loans held for sale, reflecting lower mortgage origination activity versus the same quarter of last year.","The net interest margin of 3.27% was 16 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2013, primarily due to growth in the investment portfolio and lower average rates and lower rates on new loans, partially offset by lower rates on deposits and short-term borrowings and a reduction in higher cost long-term debt.","Non-interest income increased to $168 million or 7.4% year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in other income due to the Visa sale. Including the Visa sale, increases in the majority of fee revenue categories, partially offset the decline in mortgage banking revenue. We saw growth in retail and corporate payments, merchant processing, trust and investment management fees, deposit service charges, commercial products revenue, and investment product fees.","Non-interest expense increased year-over-year by $196 million or 7.7% due to the FHA DOJ settlement. Excluding the settlement, non-interest expense was essentially flat as lower employee benefits expense driven by lower pension cost was offset by higher compensation expense, reflecting the impact of merit increases and higher staffing for risk and compliance activities.","Net income, on a linked quarter basis, was $98 million or 7% higher mainly due to an increase in total net revenue. On a linked quarter basis, net interest income increased due to higher average earning assets and an additional day in the quarter, partially offset by lower loan rates. The net interest margin of 3.27% was 8 basis points lower than the first quarter, principally due to the growth in lower rate investment securities and lower rates on new loans, mainly due to higher growth in wholesale as compared to retail loans.","On a linked quarter basis, non-interest income was higher by $336 million or 15.9%. This favorable variance was primarily due to the Visa sale, seasonally higher payments revenue and growth in all other fee categories. Higher mortgage banking revenue was principally due to a favorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights net of hedging activities. On a linked quarter basis, non-interest expense increased by $209 million or 8.2% due to the FHA DOJ settlement. Excluding the settlement, non-interest expense was essentially flat. Lower employee benefits expense was offset by higher professional services and marketing and business development expense.","Turning to Slide 10, our capital position is strong. Beginning January 1, 2014, the regulatory capital requirements effective for the Company follow Basel III subject to certain transition provisions from Basel I over the next four years to full implementation by January 1, 2018. Basel III includes two comprehensive methodologies for calculating risk weighted assets; a general standardized approach and a more risk sensitive advanced approaches. As of April 1, 2014, the Company exited its parallel run qualification period, resulting in its capital adequacy now being evaluated against which every Basel III methodology is most restrictive.","The most restrictive methodology for our Company is the currently the standardized approach. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if only implemented at June 30th was 8.9%. At 8.9%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our tangible book value per share rose to $15.26 at June 30th, representing a 13.2% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 1.8% increase over the prior quarter.","Turning to slide 11. In June, the Board of Directors declared a 6.5% increase in our common stock dividend. As a result in the second quarter, we returned 75% of our earnings to shareholders. Dividends accounted for 31% of the return to shareholders and the 50 million of stock we repurchased in second quarter accounted for the remaining 44%.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Richard.","Richard Davis","Thanks, Andy. To conclude our formal remarks, I\u2019ll turn your attention to slide 12. Again in the second quarter, we focused on extending our advantage, which is our thinking for 2014. Our advantage is real and it extents every one of our businesses. Our prudent risk management, our efficient operating platform and our industry leading profitability allow us to operate from this position of strength.","The Chicago area Charter One Bank Franchise acquisition that we completed in late June is just one example of that strength. As we move through the second half of 2014, we\u2019ll continue to look to extend our advantage. Our 67,000 talented and engaged employees remain focused on delivering consistent, predictable and repeatable results for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our community and our shareholders.","That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to be answer questions from the audience.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. My first question is the outlook on commercial loan growth for the rest of the year. I think, obviously, your gains on an organic basis continued to be quite impressive and the commentary from the large banks have reported before you, has been quite positive for the year. And I was wondering, Richard, if you could add your commentary in terms of what you are hearing from customers in terms of CapEx for the next six months?","Richard Davis ","I\u2019d be happy to, Erika. Thank you. First of all, you are right. We\u2019ve had some remarkably consistent and industry-leading growth in average loans. And with the commercial kind of the wholesale banking being up 5.9% linked quarter that would be one of our best quarters we have seen in long-time. I\u2019ll first tell you that we are seeing and particularly in the middle market where we\u2019re really want to see kind of the core growth in the country as we see middle market businesses starting to expand in a more organic basis. Credit structures are firming up at the expensive pricing. I typically tell you we don\u2019t lose on pricing and we don\u2019t because we have a cost advantage but we do see a pricing compression in both in the middle market and the leverage space. But particularly I see that as a good sign of some forms of green shoots in growth. In the larger and investment grade credit structures and pricing remain much more stable. But they are also more driven than they might be organic driven.","Loan demands for second quarter were particularly high, and in the second quarter we expect it to moderate slightly but still be at a substantially higher growth rate. In other words that 5.9% will probably moderate to something more between 3% to 5% as we look into the next quarter. Now, our loan growth is strong across the country. There is no regional definition. Retail food and ag continue to be strong and we see some weaknesses coming in oil, gas, energy and utility. So, it\u2019s probably where you had expected to be and are a reflection of loan growth and our forecast I think is in line with what you see and read about in the current economy.","Finally, we\u2019re seeing new credit opportunities being driven by refinancing, but also seeing, as I said earlier, organic growth. What\u2019s interesting is people are starting to increase inventory, we think to build for a better economy and a better outlook in quarters three and four. I\u2019d long believe that as the Fed starts to get closer to whether it\u2019s a reality of increased rates and leads to believe that they are eminent and that starts to increase economic activity at the wholesale side as people prepare for a better economy. We also expect increased M&A activity continue. And finally we see companies looking to banks to create alternative avenues of funding as they want to prove to the rating agencies that they have a diversified source of funding. So I think banks might be back in favor again for reasons that make sense but especially as rates continue to be low people don\u2019t want to miss that one they will be closest.","So, in total, I will answer even more than you asked, we were at the 2% linked quarter loan growth. We offer you guys kind of a range of 1 to 1.5 and we move around that as the quarter seasons. We are going to bring it back down to that 1.5 as a starting point as the quarter three begin and we\u2019ll start to iterate that as we get further into the quarter. But I think the 2% might be a high quarter for us this year but we\u2019re still expecting to be substantially impressive and somewhere between 1.5 range as we get further along into quarter three.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Thank you for that. And again I wanted to ask about another area of strength, the year-over-year gains and card balances certainly outperformed even on a core basis still larger competitors. And I am wondering if you can give us sort of a sense of how that correlates with sales volume versus actual balance growth and how much is this taking wallet share away from the larger competitors?","Andy Cecere","Erika, this is Andy. I would say it\u2019s the combination of all those things, as market share grow as well as core customer grow. So same-store activities, same-store sales on both the merchant and card side was up about 4.5%, a little strong in Europe than in North America but in North America right around 4%. And if you look at our card fees, both on the linked quarter and year-over-year basis, it\u2019s reflective of the increase in same-store and sales in the customer spend. And then if you look at balances, balances were relatively flat on a linked quarter basis, part of that is seasonality, but you see that growth year-over-year, the level of spend continues to increase, the level of utilization, so to speak, is flat to down a little bit.","Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America","Got it, and just one last question for you Andy. I was wondering if you could give us an update on where you are with regards to potential or LCR compliance with the proposals and also how much further pressure we should expect on the margin as we think about maybe potentially building the securities book further out for each Q only.","Andy Cecere","Sure, Erika. So, in terms, first of all in LCR, we are very close to that number. As you know, we ended this quarter at $90 billion in securities. We will plan to grow it to $95 billion in the third quarter, so $5 billion is more similar to what we saw in the second quarter. And once we get to the end of the third quarter, I\u2019ll let you know, but we\u2019re going to be very, very close as our expectations, the final rule will come out here in the next few months and that will guide us to what our final number is. But we\u2019re very close.","In terms of margin, our margin was down 8 basis points in quarter, this second quarter. And there are three components; the first is their securities bill, I just spoke to, which costs us about 3 basis points; the second was the reduction in CAA checking account advance fees, which runs through around these and we\u2019ve talked about that, that cost us about 2 basis points; and then finally the loan mix, most of the growth that occurred this quarter was in the wholesale category. In fact, wholesale overall was up about 4% and retail was relatively flat. Wholesale is a little lower yield and that cost us about 3 basis points. So that is the 8 basis points in quarter two.","As we look into quarter three, I would expect the same securities in past, about 3 basis points. I would expect a similar loan mix impact of 2 to 3 basis points. And CAA in quarter three will cause a reduction of about 5 basis points in margin, because our $39 million will go to effectively zero. So you had all that up, it\u2019s 10 to 11 basis points. But importantly, net interest income will still grow in quarter three versus quarter two.","Richard Davis","And this is Richard. And importantly, after that CAA, those 39 million going to zero we\u2019re done, so that impact is over. And as Andy said, at this call 90 days to the day we\u2019ll hopefully have both the rules and know where our final liquidity build is and we can either call it done or call it near done and give you final guidance. But for that, all that leaves is the mix and we\u2019re all hopeful that we\u2019ll continue to do well on commercial and that the consumer will start to bid its own place in growth and in that case the margins will firm up. So, we\u2019ll telegraph you all that once those two activities at CAA and liquidity build are over, we think the margin flattens out and is very small movement along with the big reason of mix.","Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America","Thank you for such complete answers. I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache from Nomura.","Bill Carcache - Nomura","Thanks, good morning. As we look ahead to the period where the Fed I guess excess reserve decreases the Fed [earnings] liquidity from the system. Could you talk a little bit about, presumably in that kind of environment, the strong deposit growth that you\u2019ve been enjoying decreases and perhaps maybe just you could comment, give us color on the packing order for your funding preferences as we look forward to a stronger long growth environment? And then perhaps also comment on whether you see banks having to, some banks having to raise more expensive funding to remain LCR complaint?","Andy Cecere","So, Bill, I would say, our focus has been on the core deposit category, you\u2019re seeing good growth in that category across DDA, as well as interest bearing deposits and then it\u2019s across both the retail as well as the wholesale and corporate trust side of the equation. We have a great funding source in our corporate trust business, which represents about 15% of our deposit base, including our DDA balances. So we have a strong core deposit and strong opportunity for continued growth. And that would be our principle preference in terms of growth as we look at increased rates.","So secondarily we have ample access to the wholesale markets in terms of debt issuance. And as you know, we have the lowest spreads out there in terms of our opportunity there, so that would be secondary delta deposit growth. And finally, we have a entity called the Money Center, which is short-term balance sheet growth in terms of deposits for wholesale customers, which just offers us another opportunity in wholesale growth. So, those are sort of order of opportunity. I will also tell you that we\u2019re positively bias to increasing rates as you see from our Q and our disclosures, 1.75% or so in terms of 200 basis point parallel shift, and in addition we have about a $100 million in waivers that will come through in fee income to the extent rates go up 75 or 100 basis points.","Bill Carcache - Nomura","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you, Andy. I had one, last one for Richard. Richard can you offer some perspective on, you gave some very helpful color in your commentary. But perhaps anything that you\u2019re seeing now that gives you greater confidence in the sustainability of the recovery given some of the stakes that what you see to-date?","Richard Davis","Hello Bill. This is more of the Richard Davis the world to see, and it\u2019s consistent. But I\u2019ve always thought that and this recession as we finally come out of it, that it\u2019s going to be the businesses that link first, in other words it\u2019s not consumed further than like it has in many times past because the wealth of that still isn\u2019t present given the housing values and some of the skittish nature of consumers heading down through this recession. So I am seeing more and more the consumerism will be incentivized by price lowering and by new activities and new product innovation by the wholesale sights.","And we\u2019re seeing that, that\u2019s why I kind of don\u2019t mind. I don\u2019t like the mix version but I like wholesale growing. It makes sense to me it is growing faster and first in this recession recovery than the consumer. That also aligns with what I think we would all agree that under giant [yelling] we\u2019re seeing more and more while she will talk about how careful she wants to be about increasing rates, we\u2019re taking away some of the time specificity that used to be there, we\u2019re not linking into unemployment rates, we\u2019re not linking it to points and time. But we\u2019re linking it to a sense of how much longer can rates be lower and what kind of levers would it give to Fed and start moving rates up.","I think there was announcement have been in our customers view that is coming to an end and that does encourage and incentivize people to take action and make some decisions that they have been sitting on for many, many years. Those are both I think sustainable kind of actions that will provide us with kind of next generation of slow but steady growth back into the consumers and we\u2019re looking for. So businesses lead out based on a belief that things are coming to an end on low rates, consumers follow then we\u2019re back into maybe a different kind of a recovery but one that we\u2019re all I think we all come greatly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Bryan Batory - Jefferies","My first question is on expenses. So ex the DOJ charge they were pretty flat quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. So just wondering what the outlook is for cost in the back half of the year and if there is an expectation that you\u2019ll continue to drive positive operating leverage?","Andy Cecere","Yes we do expect positive operating leverage. If you back out the two notable items this quarter as Richard mentioned in his comments, we did have positive operating leverage both on a linked quarter as well as year-over-year basis. We would expect to have that for the full year and we would expect to have our efficiency ratio continue to be in low 50, just like what you saw this quarter.","Bryan Batory - Jefferies","Okay, great. And then next on the discontinuation of the deposit advance product, I think previously you guys had stated that there is not a ton of offsets either with new lending products or fee based products that you can offer. Just wanted to get your updated thoughts there, are there anything you\u2019re looking at today that could offset some of that revenue give-up in the net interest income?","Richard Davis","Bryan, I would say, I don\u2019t see it, not in this category we\u2019re going to be looking more to mobile banking and some of the new innovative deposit products to offset that category. But to the extent that we would have to live within some of the new rules that have been created for that kind of a product, it would almost be a breakeven product. And we may still while come out with something, because we want to continue to be good stores of helping people, first time customers and help people that have certainly less means than the average. But at the same time it\u2019s not going to be a money maker. So, I wouldn\u2019t consider it a replacement for any kind of a fee category. I will say that U.S. Bancorp is working on and we\u2019ll probably have a product that will be sufficient to meet a different set of customer needs that we were meeting before. But I think we\u2019ll start turning our attention more to things like mobile banking and mobile payments and some of our payment categories through place where we\u2019ll be kind of forever loss and income benefit from that original checking account advance. So, we\u2019ll seek, it will take a longer to replace than it would have been just a straight up product but I wouldn\u2019t count on it.","Bryan Batory - Jefferies","Okay. And the tax rate jumped a bit. Was there anything unusual there? And is the outlook still for 28% going forward?","Andy Cecere","Yes nothing unusual 28% to 29% for the full year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.","Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets","Just a follow-up on the expense question, Richard or Andy, where are we in terms of the expense environment for U.S. Banc? I know that periodically you have the plan B, which is a more strict approach, based on the revenue environment. But just out of curiosity what is the message internally on expenses?","Richard Davis","Look, we are on plan B right now. There is plan C and D but I prefer on plan B. Our employees have been really they trust us and I appreciate that a lot. In other words, we\u2019ve said in the outlook, new plan that we expected last November when we built 2014 was revenue up X and expenses up slightly less than X. And as you all know, I think quarter one was the last quarter we\u2019re not going to see that made up. And so we\u2019ve asked everybody to reduce their expense growth, still to grow but lower level as we expect revenue to grow but at a lower level. We\u2019re in the middle of that now and what that just means is we\u2019re not taking any risk, discretionary expenses and then asked, we\u2019re asking people to watch their nickels and dimes and to keep a close eye on FTE. That\u2019s not sustainable but we also don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to need to be, but we\u2019ll continue to employ until the economy starts to show a little more robust and sustainability.","Having said that, I think we\u2019ve mentioned before, the key elements of expense growth are pretty much already in place with the Company; A, our CapEx, which is always the big number. We\u2019ve viewed the last few years to really catch-up from the many years before that. And we said our peak years behind us but we have the amortized cost that will continue further through next few. But we said our peak and that starts to move down over the coming years. We don\u2019t see any kind of a retrace back to a high level. We\u2019ve got the compensation in the FTE but for these acquisitions and new partners we bring on, we\u2019ve got a really nice steady state. Our compensation is at parity with our peers. Our performance plans pay people for performance. We\u2019ve been paying above target for the last few years because performed at that level. So, there is not a big issue there.","And then finally on just general operating cost, we have one operating system. We\u2019ve raised that one operating system and we bring in the company, we bring a set of same singular view of operating integrity. So, we don\u2019t have multiple accounting firms, accounting systems and multiple technology systems that we have to integrate. So on one hand, I told you what you all tell me which is you guys don\u2019t have much upside in reducing your expenses because you\u2019re already efficient. And I\u2019ll say that's true and you\u2019re all welcome. We worked hard at that and we\u2019ve protected. And I think by staying in low 50s as we\u2019ve committed, it\u2019s a good indicator to use that we will let revenue be the driver to expenses. But there is nothing substantial that we\u2019re holding back on or which we had the opportunity to spend money on, it\u2019s pretty much as the runway.","The last big dog in this hunt is whether or not compliance costs are fully burdened. And I\u2019m not going to be dummying up to say I think that we\u2019re done, but I believe the best in everything I\u2019m looking at we\u2019ve come to a place where our operating expenses aligns with compliance audit and operating integrity is pretty much where it needs to be for a while, separate some surprise and now we\u2019d like to put in place the last couple of quarters. So I don\u2019t see a big jump.","Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. That's helpful. And maybe question for Bill Parker just on credit, I know it\u2019s really kind of a non-issue at this point but I remember\u2026","Bill Parker","You want me to talk about credit. I am here.","Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets","Well, that\u2019s part of this is that, I remember when you broke through a 100 basis points of charge-offs and that was -- that seem like a big thing and you talked about maybe been a 90 to 100 basis point charge-off bank. Now it seems like we\u2019re bouncing around 60. Is this the trough bill or is this feel like normal where it\u2019s kind of bounce around or whether the puts and takes in terms of a loss outlook?","Bill Parker","Well, in terms of the environment we\u2019re in, which is a stable economy, modestly improving economy, yes our outlook for our losses are fairly stable. The one area we still have some room for improvement and based on the decline and delinquencies that we saw this quarter would be in residential mortgage. So, there is still room for improvement there. But for this type of environment that, that 90 to 100 that you mentioned we\u2019d refine that every quarter, right now it\u2019s 96. But that's a through the cycle measure, it looks of good times and the bad times. So right now where we\u2019re at is a comfortable spot for this type of environment.","Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And Bill anything making you nervous or anything where you\u2019re holding the line and saying that we\u2019re not going to do that?","Bill Parker","Well, I wouldn\u2019t be doing my job for some of those. But in general, we have not materially changed any of our underwriting standards. The only thing we did coming out of the downturn was do some controlled expansion on our indirect auto portfolio, that's gone well. We\u2019ve had strong originations in that space, but it\u2019s all very high credit quality.","Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Bill Parker","Thanks Jon.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Werner with Morningstar.","Dan Werner - Morningstar","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess relative to with credit quality kind of expanding on that, with commercial loan growing and kind of driving the loan growth here and stable credit quality you\u2019re still releasing reserves here. Should we expect that to continue or reverse going forward as loans continue to grow here?","Bill Parker","Well, some day, yes. And I can\u2019t tell you the exact infection point. But our reserve release this quarter was $25 million, so very modest less than or about a penny of share. So whether we release a little or start adding a little depending upon the strength of loan and commitment growth, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not that relevant to the earnings potential going forward. But we watch that, we still have little bit of credit improvement to go and so we watch that balance that with our loan and commitment growth.","Richard Davis","Yes, Dan, it will be a super easily telegraph very soft turning the corner that if when that happens in the inflection. So, you won\u2019t be surprised by one quarter over the next because it\u2019s a very slow process. And eventually I\u2019d love to be adding to loan losses because the loan growth is so robust and because we should prepare for years forward. So, that to me at the end of the day won\u2019t be a bad outcome, but we\u2019re not there yet.","Dan Werner - Morningstar","Okay. And then second question on mortgage revenue, I had in my notes that to expect like between $225 million and $250 million in revenue, is that still consistent or relatively the range that we\u2019re going to see for the rest of the year?","Andy Cecere","Yes, I think that's in the range. So, if you look into the third quarter versus the second quarter, this is Andy. We would expect mortgage application volume to increase slightly, typical seasonal increases, but the servicing revenue will down a bit. So I would expect it to be flat to down a bit from this quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Murray with ISI.","Keith Murray - ISI","If you could just touch on the fee momentum, it looks like you had pretty broad momentum in fee category this quarter. You\u2019ve obviously just touched on the mortgage outlook. But can you just give a sense of which line items or which categories, ex-seasonality in 2Q, you feel like there is good underlying momentum that could carry through in the back half of \u201814?","Andy Cecere","Sure. This is Andy again. So across our payments businesses, we saw growth in all four categories. I would say most of that government pressure that we had seen in corporate card is behind us and that government actually grew this quarter, as well as corporate. So corporate fees are good, merchant processing fees continue to grow, card fees continue to grow. Our trust and investment management is doing very well both on the wealth management side, as well as the corporate trust side. Commercial product fees, which is reflection of corporate and wholesale activity continues to grow, investment management is growing. So we\u2019re actually seeing growth across many categories of our fees. And including deposit service charge, which is more seasonal and based on days, but really I wouldn\u2019t say there are any particular weaknesses and strong growth across all. And I thank all of them are quite leveraged to an economic recovery. So, to the extent the growth accelerates, so I think we\u2019ll see even accelerated the growth.","Richard Davis","And I would add to that, Keith, with interest rates and FX volatility solo that\u2019s the area where that line continues to be under some pressure. But as Andy said, it\u2019s very positively extorted into the economy. So the backlog is good and corporate bond fees are on track. So, we\u2019re seeing some of those coming back to some level that make sense as the economy starts to warm up a bit. But that would be there lag rates as we go through the list of key businesses that we watch.","Keith Murray - ISI","Thank you. Maybe one for Bill, can you give an update on the sneak review, was any of that in this quarter, I am assuming it\u2019s going to be in the third quarter for you guys, but just any thoughts on the process this year versus past, et cetera.","Bill Parker","Yes, I am glad you asked that actually, because usually we do get the results in August, but this year we got them early. So we have processed everything, it\u2019s in our results. Any changes for us were completely immaterial. We had excellent results. We have not seen sort of OCCs that are the regulators industry publication, which give some insights into where they saw stress on really just speaking for our portfolio. But we\u2019re in and done with it and no material impact.","Keith Murray - ISI","Okay, thanks. And then last one, seems like GAAP assets were up about 10% year-over-year, the Basel III risk weighted assets were up around 7%, is this just a mix thing meaning more securities, highly rated securities or is there any kind of optimization going on that you guys are focused on?","Richard David","It\u2019s exactly what we said. It\u2019s the securities growth at a lower risk weighted asset.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous.","Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous","So on the loan growth, I mean clearly you guys are doing very well. I guess, one of the things I\u2019d scratch my head is when I benchmark you to the large domestic banks and the HA or what\u2019s come out so far in the quarter, clearly the 6.7% year-over-year growth ex-charter one is best-in-class. But then when I benchmark you to the kind of head line numbers for the system, it\u2019s about a line. And it seems like that this can act a clearly there is the small bank trend, which you\u2019ve talked about in the past. And I was hoping you could update us on where you see that level of competition? But then B, there is this kind of new trend of foreign banks really growing quite rapidly at least in the total system data. And I was wondering if you could also offer any thoughts you have there? Is that something that is material and you\u2019re seeing in your markets or is that more happening in the capital markets and leverage lending and not really affecting you?","Richard Davis","Yes, sure. This is Richard. So, first of all, I guess, I think there are four categories. I think of that you said the kind of domestic banks, I think that the regional banks like us, I think of community banks, and I think of the foreign banks. And our intelligence, neither the community banks nor the foreign banks, was taking any market share or creating any impairment to our growth. So, I can\u2019t really look at all the data that you\u2019re looking at. On the HA we typically are about half to twice better than those averages as we track it ourselves. So it\u2019s consistent with what we\u2019re seeing. Community banks are -- they\u2019re not as diversified, so they will go down the path on one or two loan product type and we\u2019ll fight a good fight in certain smaller markets.","At the end of the day when you\u2019re looking for a customer with a need for more than just one loan or one type of loan, we typically win the day on that. And the foreign banks maybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re more centrally located in the middle of country and even to the West Coast, but they are simply not creating a burden to us that we\u2019ve noticed at this point and they have in the past, so both of those categories have found us in the times before. I think I\u2019ll take it backdoor to the longstanding rationale that we\u2019ve used to take it outside of it, I wonder what they are doing to, that make sense category and that is our funding advantage is just substantial, I mean they\u2019re real.","They\u2019re very real and they are very big. And you compare to any of those other three groups from the larger money center banks, to the community banks, to the foreign banks, we view them every time. So thus for this management team getting greedy or sloppy and letting too much of that benefit go away altogether, we\u2019re letting it build itself out. I mean the higher pricing benefits to the highest quality customer, which is why we can have high quality, have growth and have that on a lower risk side and use some of that advantage. So hopefully that makes sense as to why we\u2019re doing. There is no magic here and there is no sustainably risk of this going away unless we were to harm our own ratings. So we\u2019re not planning to do that either. So, hopefully Brian that gives you a little more color.","Brian Foran - Autonomous","That does. Thank you. All my other questions have been asked. Thanks.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research","I am express a little bit of concern about the behavior of consumer deposits as rates rise and wondered if you\u2019ve given much thought to the issues if you guys are testing, if you see the need for any new or different products this time around or if you expect things to be pretty sticky?","Andy Cecere","Nancy, this is Andy. I do think we\u2019re going to see a decline in deposits overall more than what we had seen historically when rates start to move up and we\u2019ve actually modeled that in our rate sensitivity when we give you our numbers. The best example I think is our DDA levels have gone from about $50 billion to almost $74 billion and I do expect, because there is low opportunity cost of that DDA today as rates move up, we\u2019re going to see some decline there. So, we are modeling it that way. We are preparing for it that way. And we also have a number of consumer products that we\u2019re testing in different markets in terms of a little higher rate to continue to grow core deposits.","Richard Davis","Yes, and I\u2019ll add to that Nancy. I said home deposit start to fall because that would be a great indicator that people are using their cash. As you know then they\u2019ll use our -- the line they have been paying for and then they will give a new line. That brings me to utilization a little bit. We are seeing utilization continue to be slowly but surely getting better, slowly is the operative. We are not seeing a huge turn but actually this last quarter was the first increase in our wholesale utilization since 2008, smaller than it might be that\u2019s a pretty big deal and that\u2019s along with the potential of deposits starting to come out. Those would be actually good signs I think of consumers and businesses using their money and then some of our money to kind of fund their growth.","But I will say we also have this advantage that we want to remind people of on the core deposit side with our corporate trust business, which has a fair amount of contractual difference and distinction 15% or so of our non-interest bearing comes from that safer category. And no matter what the stress test that we provide will result in, it allows us with a little bit more of a foundation core deposits that at the end again with this corporate trust we don\u2019t talk enough about but provides the distinction and the uniqueness to our portfolio.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research","Thanks for pointing that out. Richard, your thoughts about the payments businesses right now, are you seeing any opportunities, are you more or less excited as you see better economic activity to add to the payments portfolio?","Richard Davis","Yes, I am really loving it I mean we have it. One of the things I often say to you Nancy directly and the others is, if you like us now you are going to love us all when things get better. But one of the things that we haven\u2019t talk much about is the R&D that we have been spending on payment, mobile payments, not thinking so much as payment which is a space we should be leading in. And there are so many derivatives of what possibly happen and next that people wanting to pay for things and track things and move things. And just about every single prototype we can think of, testing all kinds of different programs and I look forward to the chance to showcase some of those outcomes. It\u2019s our style not to talk about the things we are filing because I want to try them first and while I telegraph that to others and if they don\u2019t work then you will never know and if they do we will brag about it endlessly.","But I think payments it\u2019s going to be that next step and I think of my response to the question that Bill or Brian asked, I think it\u2019s going to be the replacement fee opportunity for banks as we get to the more core checking cost and start getting paid for helping people see, track and move their money more naturally and more quickly in this environment. So I like payment for that reason and I like to diversify. Andy, told you government is turning the corner at least stop shrinking, corporate is getting strong as some of these other green shoots we\u2019ve seen in C&I and the consumer, based on credit volume year-over-year, was up 9%, debit was 5% and prepaid, which is our favorite new space which we have created and graded up 22%. So, for us the payments is a good place to be and like the balance sheet if you like it now you are going to love it later but I think it\u2019s entirely it\u2019s actually favorably toward an increasing economy. So, we will cross our fingers.","Nancy Bush - NAB Research","And I have to throw in one thing, Richard.

[Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon, Eastern Daylight Time, through Wednesday, October 24th at 12:00 midnight, Eastern Daylight Time.","I will now turn the conference call over to Jenn Thompson, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Please go ahead.","Jenn Thompson","Thank you, Casey and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Andy Cecere and Terry Dolan are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s third quarter results and to answer your questions.","Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.","I'd like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page two of today\u2019s presentation, in our press release, and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.","I'll now turn the call over to Andy.","Andrew Cecere","Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry and I will be opening up the call to Q&A.","Let me begin on slide three. In the third quarter, we reported record net income and earnings per share driven by record revenue and positive operating leverage. In line with our expectations, loan growth accelerated in the third quarter, supported by continued strength in consumer lending and a pickup in commercial loan growth.","On the right side of slide three, you can see that credit quality improved in the third quarter and our book value per share increased by 5.3% from year ago. During the third quarter, we returned 78% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.","Slide four highlights our best-in-class performance metrics including a 19.9% return on tangible common equity. Our efficiency ratio, return on average assets, and return on average common equity all improved sequentially and on a year-on-year basis.","Now, let me turn the call over to Terry, who will provide more detail on the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance.","Terrance Dolan","Thanks Andy. If you turn to slide five, I'll start with the balance sheet review and follow-up with the discussion of earnings trends. Average loan grew 0.9% on a linked-quarter basis and increased 1.8% on a year-over-year basis excluding the impact of a student loan portfolio sale in the second quarter.","We saw continued growth in retail portfolios such as mortgage and retail leasing. Credit card loan growth was supported by expansion in both the number of active accounts and sales per active account.","We are seeing good momentum in digital acquisitions across platforms. As expected, commercial loan growth accelerated in the third quarter following modest growth in the first half of the year. Pipelines remain strong and we are seeing CapEx investment and M&A activity among our corporate clients.","Alternative funding sources such as the capital markets and companies own cash balances are limiting the clients' need to access the loan markets, but to a lesser extent, than during the last several quarters.","As investment spending gains traction and companies worked through their cash balances and tax repatriation, we expect commercial loan growth to continue to improve. Consistent with the past several quarters, commercial real estate loans declined reflecting our decisions not to extend credit as unfavorable terms and continued pay downs as customers seek alternative financing.","This quarter, excluding the impact of a student loan sale, commercial real estate contributed a 27 basis point drag to linked-quarter growth and a 122 basis point reduction to year-over-year loan growth. While pay down activity remains a headwind, it is gradually diminishing in intensity and we expect the trend to continue.","Turning to slide six, deposits declined 1.4% on a linked-quarter basis. This included the impact of an anticipated balance migration related to the business merger of a large financial client, which represents about half of the balance decline. This impact is expected to moderate in the fourth quarter.","About half of our deposits are retail customer balances within our consumer and business banking business line where we saw a 0.7% linked-quarter increase in average deposits, driven by a 2.7% increase in non-interest-bearing deposits.","Within corporate and commercial banking, our business customers are deploying the deposit balances to support growth and are migrating balances to alternative investment vehicles. This drove some of the decline this quarter.","Additionally our corporate trust business saw seasonal declines in deposit balances associated with the timing of the receipt and distribution of funds. These deposit flows are consistent with our asset liability modeling expectations.","Slide seven indicates that credit quality improved in the third quarter due to improving economic conditions with customer pay downs resulting in pressure on loan balances, but an improved credit profile. Notably our non-performing assets declined 8.0% compared with the second quarter and decreased 19.7% compared with the third quarter of 2017.","Slide eight provides highlights of third quarter earnings results including a 3.9% increase in diluted earnings per share on a linked-quarter basis. On slide nine, linked-quarter and year-over-year net interest income growth was supported by higher interest rates and earning asset growth which was partly offset by a shift in deposit and funding mix.","Year-over-year growth was negatively impacted by tax reform which reduced the taxable equivalent adjustment benefit related to tax exempt assets. In the third quarter, the net interest margin was 3.15%, up two basis points linked-quarter and one basis point compared with the year ago. The impact of tax reform and taxable equivalent earning assets year-over-year and net interest margin expansion by two basis points.","Our interest-bearing deposit betas continue to perform in line with our expectations during the last few rate hikes. As future rate hikes continue, we expect -- we continue to expect the deposit beta will trend toward 50%, which compares with the current level of about 45%.","The betas on our commercial and deposit -- and trust deposit basis, which represents about half of our total deposits, are in line with our estimated terminal betas. We expect that movement in the overall beta going forward will primarily be driven by our consumer deposit base.","Slide 10 highlights trends in non-interest income. On a year-over-year basis, we had strong growth in payments revenue and trust and investment management revenue partially offset by a decrease in commercial product revenue, mortgage banking revenue, and treasury management fees.","Commercial product revenue pressure reflected market dynamics in corporate bond underwriting and loan syndications. Mortgage revenue was affected by lower refinancing activity and lower gain on sale margins. Despite lingering market headwinds, we expect the year-over-year decline in mortgage banking revenue to moderate in the fourth quarter.","We are well-positioned as a waning refi market transitions to a more robust purchase mortgage market. We are optimistic that gain on sale margins in this business have stabilized and will expand as excess capacity leaves the origination market. The decline in treasury management fees reflects the impact of changes in earnings credits which is typical in a rising rate environment.","Turning to our payments business, we had strong growth in credit and debit card revenue and double-digit growth in corporate payment revenue each reflecting higher sales volumes.","As we have been signaling for several quarters, merchant promising revenue return to mid-single-digit base in the third quarter as we lapped the impact from the exit of joint ventures in the second quarter of 2017.","Merchant acquiring sales volume growth continues to be strong. We expect merchant processing revenue to continue to strengthen in the fourth quarter of 2018. Trust and investment management revenue growth was driven by business growth as well as favorable market conditions.","Turning to slide 11, non-interest expense decreased 1.3% on a linked-quarter basis, partly reflecting typical seasonality and increased 1.5% on a year-over-year basis. Compensation expense increased principally due to the impact of hiring to support business growth and compliance programs, merit increases, and higher variable compensation related to business production.","Notably within non-personnel expenses, professional services expense declined from year ago primarily due to fewer consulting services as compliance programs near maturity where we expect compliance related cost to continue to moderate through the year.","Other expense declined from a year ago due to lower deposit insurance and litigation costs as well as a reduction in cost related tax advantaged projects as we syndicate tax credits in the secondary market.","Slide 12 highlights our capital position. At September 30th, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach was 9.0%. This compares to our capital target of 8.5%.","I'll now provide some forward looking guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased in the low single-digits on a year-over-year basis strengthening from the third quarter growth rate.","We expect fee revenue to increase in the low to mid-single-digits year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage on a core basis in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2018. We expect credit quality to remain relatively stable compared with the third quarter.","Now, I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.","Andrew Cecere","Thanks Terry. The second half of 2018 is shaping up as we had anticipated and momentum is building on our core businesses as we head into the end of the year. We expect the loan growth to continue to accelerate in the fourth quarter and our fee businesses remain on a good trajectory. Merchant acquiring revenue growth is gaining momentum and our other two payments businesses, retail card issuing and corporate payment services, are firing on all cylinders.","In wealth management and investment services, we are benefiting from favorable market conditions even as we continue to grow new accounts and reap the benefits of our strong market position in corporate trust.","We remain diligent in our focus on managing expenses for whatever revenue environment we are operating in and we are committed to delivering positive operating leverage in the upcoming quarter for the full year 2018 and 2019.","We manage our company for the long-term while balancing shorter term financial objectives. This approach means that we will be prudent with expense management, but continue to make traditional investments in our businesses and accelerate investments to enhance our digital and payments capabilities.","In terms of more traditional investments, we recently announced the expansion of our middle-market commercial banking team in the New York metro area where we have a strong presence in the large corporate space for over 10 years and will be able to leverage that existing platform.","On a technology and innovation front, we announced the creation of a new fully digital capability for small businesses to apply for and receive a loan or line of credit. The application of funding time is often less than an hour, improving on a process that can take weeks within the industry.","During the third quarter, we acquired Electronic Transaction Systems, which enhances our integrated software capabilities within our merchant processing business. It expands us into the new municipality industry vertical where we can leverage our government banking relationships within corporate and commercial banking. These investments and future investments will enable us to stay at the forefront in banking and will drive improved operating leverage over the next several years.","We understand the value we create for our shareholders starts with the value we create for our customers. As the banking industry evolves in this new era of digital capabilities, we continue to look for ways to use technology and innovation to make our customers' financial lives simpler and more productive while at the same time protecting their data, their personal information, and their privacy. If we do it right and we will do it right, our customers win, our employees win, and our shareholders.","In closing, I'd like to thank our U.S. Bank team members across the country for bringing their A game to work every day, to deliver on the promise of One U.S. Bank, and driving outstanding results for each of our stakeholders.","That concludes our formal remarks. Terry and I will now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","And your first question comes from John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead, your line is open.","John McDonald","Hi good morning guys. Wanted to ask a little bit about the positive operating leverage, you had a nice print on positive operating leverage this quarter, looks like about 80 basis points. Just wondering how much help you got on the expense line this quarter from some of the accrual reversals and any other one-timers that you mentioned?","And then more importantly as you look out into next year and I think you've talked about shooting for operating leverage gap of 1% to 1.5% next year, what do you see as the drivers for that to accelerate next year to that range you talked about?","Andrew Cecere","I'd ask Terry to start, then I'll jump in.","Terrance Dolan","Yes, John, let me talk a little bit about the expense question that we had. Again our focus is around being able to deliver that positive operating leverage. But at the end of looking at expenses, we're kind of focused on a lot of different areas. You mentioned the litigation accruals, that actually is not a very big driver of the overall change. If you think about on a year-over-year basis, the biggest drivers is that is -- one is related to tax credit amortization costs which are lower this year versus last year. And when you think about it with tax reform and us having lower tax expenses, the capacity that we generate in tax credit production allows us to generate both fee revenue through tax credit syndication, but also reduce our tax credit amortization and that's something that we believe is both sustainable over the long haul.","The second thing that we've kind of talked about, our FDIC insurance is a little bit lower than what we expected and then if we think about our mortgage servicing costs, we continue to be just as the refi market has changed, et cetera, the mortgage servicing type of costs would come down and foreclosure related costs, et cetera. So, those are probably the biggest drivers.","On a quarter -- on a linked-quarter basis, the tax credit amortization represents the majority of the change. So, those are things I would focus on.","Andrew Cecere","And John, Andy. As we look at next year, I would highlight a couple of things. As we've talked about, we've lapped the payments to the merchant revenue issue and you saw that that's growing 4%. We continue to expect that to accelerate as we go into next quarter and next year.","Mortgage revenue which has been a little bit of a headwind in the industry, I think, will start to come back. We are seeing accelerated loan growth, continued economic growth, and then across all our business, we're seeing increase in market share and customer acquisition. So, those are all things that I was positive opportunities for 2019 revenue.","John McDonald","Okay. And Andy just a quick follow-up. Is the 1% to 1.5% still kind of a good target as you sit here now and look out to 2019 for the operating leverage that you're going to shoot for?","Andrew Cecere","Yes, it is.","John McDonald","Okay. And then one quick follow-up Terry. The FDI insurance fees lower that you mentioned, what was the driver of that? And you still have a stepdown coming from the end of the surcharge later in the fourth quarter next year?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. The biggest driver is really the FDIC rate as much as anything. And as we make capital decisions and other things and then if you think about kind of our risk profile, we are getting an FDIC kind of benefit from a rate standpoint, that's probably the biggest driver.","And then I think your second question was really related to the surcharge. If you think about the surcharge, so -- if you think about the fourth quarter, we expect the surcharge to continue and until it ends, we're going to continue to expect it to be there. So, we'll wait for that decision. The impact to us on a quarterly basis is about $20 million related to that surcharge. So that kind of gives you some sense in terms of the size of it as well as you're thinking about that for the future.","Andrew Cecere","And John, importantly, we're not assuming that surcharge goes away as we think about positive operating leverage in 2019.","John McDonald","Great. Thanks guys.","Andrew Cecere","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead, your line is open.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Andrew Cecere","Good morning.","Terrance Dolan","Good morning John.","John Pancari","On the loan growth front, I heard you're on the expectation that we're going to see some good acceleration in growth in coming quarters, your release for next quarter. What is really driving that view? What is changing that you're calling out? Is more about the pay down abatement that you think is going to continue? Or the bond market flow finding its way back to the bank loan market? Or is it more about just outright demand? Thanks.","Terrance Dolan","Yes, I mean, I think it's actually a combination of all of those things you think about it. I mean we've been talking about the fact that our pipelines have been getting stronger and M&A activity has been picking up. We've seen in our corporate payments business the spend by businesses in both discretionary and CapEx getting stronger. So, I think part of it is demand, at least, in terms of what we are seeing. I do -- we're also seeing the pay downs that we saw in late 2017 and in the second -- in the first half this year, those starting to moderate. They are still continuing, but I think they are moderating.","And so, it is kind of a combination of all those different activities. I also think that as the long end of the curve has moved up, the opportunity within the capital market spaces -- that dynamic has changed a little bit. So, I think it's a combination of all of those different things.","And we think -- as we think about the third quarter linked-quarter was up 0.9%, the fourth quarter will get a little stronger and we expect that to get stronger as we move into 2019 as well.","John Pancari","And related to that, the line utilization on slide 16, despite some of these trends, you're still seeing it trend down. I mean is that -- are you signaling an inflection that you expect that we should start to see next quarter?","Terrance Dolan","Yes, well, I guess what we end up looking to utilization rates. We think as kind of stable it ends up balancing kind of up and down. I do believe that when you end up thinking about the optimism and capital expenditures that are -- that we are seeing, I do think that there's the opportunity for utilization to expand and so as we kind of think about that, that's a part of the equation let's say.","John Pancari","Okay. Terry thanks. And then just one last thing on the deposit side, how should we think about overall deposit growth trends going forward? I know you've flagged the volatility from the customer merger and all that you've flagged, but how should we think about growth from this level going forward on total deposit trends?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. So, I think it's really kind of point to three things and I talked about some of those, but just let me just kind of reiterate. One is that our consumer deposits are growing. They grow -- they grew nicely both on a linked-quarter and year-over-year basis. So, I think that that's good and that that tells us that from prices standpoint, we feel pretty good about that and what we're seeing in that market is good.","The large customer -- or the financial customer that was part of a business combination, we've known and we've anticipated that those balances are going to be migrating and we've been working with that customer to kind of know and understand timing. But to, kind of, give you some perspective, on a year-over-year basis, the decline is nearly 100% related to the fact that that customer migration is occurring. On a linked-quarter basis that represents about half of that. So, when we kind of take that into consideration, we know that that's going to moderate in the fourth quarter. When we look at the fourth quarter, we think about 2019 in particular, we actually think it's going to moderate and allow us to be able to grow deposits again.","John Pancari","Got it. Thank you, Terry.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Andrew Cecere","Hey Matt.","Matthew O'Connor","Good morning. Another one on loan growth because you're one of the few banks that had accelerating loan growth this quarter and seem a bit more optimistic than others. Any idea why maybe you're seeing a slowdown and pay downs and a couple of other of your peers have pointed to an acceleration. Is there something different in the mix or is it just the way the lumpiness in that business can be?","Terrance Dolan","Yes, I mean I think -- again it's probably a combination of things that could be lumpiness. We're in different markets. We end up having a much bigger community banking market than maybe some of the other competitors have been describing. So, it probably is a combination of things. It's not necessarily one thing that we can kind of pinpoint, let's put it that way.","Matthew O'Connor","Okay. And then when you talk about accelerating loan growth in 4Q, is that versus the kind of 4% annualized growth that you had in 3Q versus 2Q? Or are you talking about on a year-over-year basis were loans were only up 1% in the third quarter?","Andrew Cecere","Matt, this is Andy. We were talking about that, the 0.9% accelerating to a higher number on a linked-quarter basis.","Matthew O'Connor","Okay, got it. All right. Thank you.","Andrew Cecere","Thanks Matt.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Andrew Cecere","Hey Ken.","Terrance Dolan","Good morning Ken.","Kenneth Usdin","Good morning guys. How are you? First question just on the on the balance sheet and repricing characteristics, so it's getting harder to talk about sequential betas per se, so deposit costs up 10 basis points, how would you characterize that in terms of your expectations of the rate of change in terms of what you saw this quarter? And how that might go forward in the context of that you had previously talked about NIMs continuing to expand. So, can you help us understand that dynamic within?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. So, maybe a couple of things. We end up looking at net interest margin, of course, how it expands, how much better, is always a function of how your balance sheet ends up changing what sort of loan mix you have, et cetera.","Certainly as we kind of think about deposits or funding costs, well, let me kind of step back, I think there's other reasons, our investment portfolio continues to be a creative as we as we see roll-off and that will continue at least through the vast majority of next year.","So, I think there's a couple of things on the asset side that's positive. On the deposit side, I really think that -- and we've talked about this, deposit betas, they are at about 45%. We think they will migrate up to 50% whether it's this next rate hike or the following, but it's slowly moving in that direction.","And our corporate trust and our wholesale deposit pricing is pretty much at terminal level. So, the movement of the deposit betas is really going to be more a function of how fast consumer deposits and the move in.","And we are maybe seeing a little bit more competition in that particular space, but it hasn't been significantly greater. So, I think it's just kind of a function of all those different things.","Andrew Cecere","And Terry our deposit beta assumptions have been consistent with what's happening.","Terrance Dolan","Yes exactly.","Kenneth Usdin","Yes, fair. And Terry to that point you mentioned on the asset side, can you help us dig in a little bit? Can you talk to us about front book, back book, on the securities yields? And also the types of loan growth you were expecting to see increase, is that also the types of stuff that's also accretive to the existing loan yield? Thanks.","Terrance Dolan","Yes. So, on the investment side of the equation, if you think about our portfolio -- our investment portfolio, it has a duration of around four years which is what we've talked about. We are seeing a fairly significant amount of low yielding treasuries and those types of securities that are now rolling off. The -- its pretty consistent with what we talked about last quarter that that roll-off is accretive at a 100 to 125 basis points, so that that continually gives you the opportunity to be able to see some accretion with respect to that particular portfolio.","Now, on the loan side, again, I would point to the fact that we've seen nice growth in residential and we've seen nice growth in our credit card and our consumer type of products. And that type of mix will be beneficial to us as we kind of look in the future and we would expect and anticipate that to continue.","Kenneth Usdin","Okay, got it. Thanks guys.","Andrew Cecere","Thanks Ken.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Erika Najarian","Yes. Thank you. Good morning.","Andrew Cecere","Good morning Erika.","Terrance Dolan","Good morning Erika.","Erika Najarian","So, my first question is a follow-up to the competitive aspects on -- for commercial. The bond market was brought up, but I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of how much competition non-banks like private equity firms, how much competition that's posing to U.S. Bancorp?","And as an add-on to that. What is your on balance sheet exposure to broadly syndicated leverage lending and private equity-backed transaction?","Andrew Cecere","You start there second question.","Terrance Dolan","Yes. So, with respect to leverage lending, that is something in terms of our balance sheet, we have never really had any significant amount of lending in that particular space. So, it's an area that we managed pretty tightly and again, it kind of is reflective of our credit risk profile. So, as we think about the next downturn, we feel like we'll be in a pretty good spot from a leverage lending point of view.","Andrew Cecere","And then Erika on your question on private equity you're now in bank or non-bank competition, I would say that is evident in some of the wholesale categories. I think it's probably most prominent in our commercial real estate category where some of the pay downs that are occurring are because of non-bank competition coming into the marketplace. But as we said and as Terry said in his remarks that is starting to abate here as we come into the third and fourth quarter.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And another follow-up question on the expense side. I wanted to make sure I understood the Ryan run in particular for other expenses. So, as I think about the three year sort of average for other expenses, the average is about $450 million and it was $414 million last quarter and $377 million this quarter. Terry, am I right to think that that's all the tax credit amortization expense that you were discussing earlier? And I'm wondering if that $377 million is a good run rate for us to think about. And whether or not there is an offset in the tax rate line that we need to consider?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. Well, it's already incorporated into the tax rate that we have because when you think about when you establish your tax rate for the year, you think about the entire year in terms of what your tax credit production is going to be. So, it's already a low tax rate.","Here's the way that I would think about it Erika. I do think that the tax credit amortization is going to be an opportunity, it's going to be something that's going to continue, but it also has a quarterly cycle to it. The third and fourth quarter happened to be your strongest production quarters and so tax credit amortization and the impact associated with it, tends to be more dramatic in the third and fourth quarter. So, there's a little bit of a seasonality.","I guess if I were looking at it, I think the $377 million might be a little bit on the lower end of that range, but reasonable.","Andrew Cecere","And the fourth quarter, Terry, is actually higher than the third quarter. So, we'll see a little bit of an increase in that -- in the fourth quarter because of that.","Terrance Dolan","Yes. Last year it went up about $60 million, this year it's probably close to $40 million that it will increase just because of tax credit amortization.","Andrew Cecere","Third quarter to fourth quarter?","Terrance Dolan","Yes.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And just the follow-up question for you Andy. I think that the performance in bank stocks lately have seemed to reflect some revenue concerns rather than credit concerns for 2019. Although, of course, you bucked the trend in loan growth this quarter and I'm wondering what your message is on that positive operating leverage on 1% to 1.5%. So, I guess this is a two-part question. Where is the company in terms of it's -- not less traditional investment spend? So, let's talk about technology for example. And if the revenue environment is less robust for the whole industry than we'd hope, will you still be able to deliver that positive operating leverage for 2019?","Terrance Dolan","Short answer to your question Erika is yes. The longer answer is we do expect credit to continue to be favorable, its 46 basis points in charge-off this quarter. The loan growth is the only reason we added to our reserve. Credit quality underlying that is very stable, but we have good loan growth, so we added to reserve and as we have done in the past. As we think about next year in terms of the revenue, we have some positives as I talked about earlier. It's both the combination of less -- fewer headwinds as well as continuing momentum in certain businesses. But as we've also said we'll manage expenses consistent with what we see from the revenue side equations, sort of like we did in this quarter. So, we expect to continue accelerated revenue opportunity next year and we're managing expenses with that in mind. If the revenue doesn't happen as we think, we'll manage expenses more prudently.","Erika Najarian","That's helpful. Thank you.","Terrance Dolan","You bet.","Andrew Cecere","And Erika maybe one thing that I would just kind of add to that. I think when you end up looking our business mix, so this is one of the things that we've talked about in the past, the business mix having the strong fee base sort of businesses and payments, et cetera and with consumer spend continuing to get stronger, I just see that as something that differentiates us as we think about the future.","Operator","And your next question comes from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill + Partners. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Scott Siefers","Morning guys. Thanks for taking the questioning.","Andrew Cecere","Morning Scott.","Terrance Dolan","Hello Scott.","Scott Siefers","Just wanted to go back to the deposit dynamics for a quick second. First just make sure I understand the large customer migration you talked about that just went from deposits out of deposits, right, rather than a move within the category of total deposits?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. Those are deposit outflows from the company and if you think about it was acquired by another financial institution and they wanted to bring those deposits under their balance sheet. And it's something that we have been anticipating, that's been a part of our NIM and our asset liability modeling process for well over a year.","Scott Siefers","Yes, okay. Thank you for that. And then just within the categories same directional trend that you guys versus others which is sort of money coming out of non-interest-bearing into other categories. But the order of magnitude seemed a little larger for you guys and I've seen in others. So, I guess one given you guys are a little unique in terms of business mix with like corporate trust in there, for example, so there's an element of apples-to-oranges. But if maybe you could just briefly walk through how you guys differ from just sort of a typical bank? And then more importantly, I guess, how will that dynamic flush out or play out here as we move forward just given the uniqueness of your business mix?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. Well, I mean again the thing that we end up really focus on in terms of the uniqueness is our corporate business and I mean within those trust structures as yields have gone up, they continue to look for opportunities to be able to get as much yield as they can within that structure and so migrations from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing is something that we kind of anticipate and expected.","There is a portion of those structures though that is very operational in nature and is sticky within the non-interest-bearing. So, while that migration has been occurring, I don't know whether that will continue to be as strong as it has been in the past.","Andy, if you could--?","Andrew Cecere","Yes, so the corporate trust business is a great -- not only great fee business, but it's a great deposit gathering business. And as Terry mentioned, there's two components to it, one is operational nature and the flows that occur will continue to occur regardless of the rate environment because it is a flow between the bond issuer and the bond holder.","The second component or what I would call more short-term investments and that's where we're seeing more of the volatility, but it's as we expected and particularly in this rate environment is new investment opportunities present themselves, so bottom-line Scott, I don't think it's anything that we didn't anticipate. We're going to be a little bit lumpier because of that second component, but it's in line with what we expect.","Terrance Dolan","Now the other thing is that because of the corporate trust business, the size of our total deposits as a percentage of our total funding cost that even though our deposit pricing may be a little bit higher, our total funding costs are very competitive excuse me.","Scott Siefers","Okay, that's perfect. Thank you guys for the color. And then if I can ask one last sort of tic-tac question. You had the Elan unit sale that you have announced a few weeks back, any revenue or expense impact as we look into like 2019 that you guys would call out from the loss of that business?","Andrew Cecere","Yes. So, I mean that sale is so impressed. Maybe I can just step back a little bit. That is very specific to third-party ATM processing and it's also the sale of our MoneyPass debit card network and so it's not related to our payments business. As I knew there was a little bit of confusion on that early, so I just want to make sure that actually--","Terrance Dolan","It actually rolls up to consumer bank.","Andrew Cecere","Yes. And the -- it would end up kind of dimensional, so 2017 revenue for that business on an annualized basis was $170 million. On a quarterly basis, third quarter, I believe the revenue was around $45 million and then the efficiency ratio of that business pretty similar to the rest of our company maybe a slightly higher, but pretty similar to the rest of our company. So, if you kind of take that information, you can get some sense, both in terms of fourth quarter and 2019.","From a fourth quarter perspective, right now we anticipate that the sale will close at the end of October, but if not in October, then the end of November and we just have to kind of wait and see based upon regulatory approval.","Scott Siefers","Okay. All right. That's great. Thank you guys very much.","Andrew Cecere","Thanks Scott.","Operator","Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Betsy Graseck","Hey good morning.","Andrew Cecere","Morning Betsy.","Terrance Dolan","Morning.","Betsy Graseck","Andy can you talk a little bit about the different levers that you've got on the expense side, when we're thinking about the operating leverage for next year? I know you talked through kind of revenue line items already, but what's in your back pocket there?","Andrew Cecere","Well, one of the things we talked about is we are investing in both traditional as we talked about the expansion in our commercial banking business as well as more of the digital and payments businesses. We did an acquisition in the third quarter as we talked about we are continuing to expand our capabilities on our mobile application, our capabilities in terms of sales activity on that application. And everything you think about from an investment standpoint as a little bit of a digital focus on it. So that will continue.","We have continued opportunity in terms of optimization of different business processes which we are working across the company in terms of our branch optimization across structures and where we are in this space and so forth. So, we have a number of things, a number of initiatives we're working on. And at a high level, actually I would describe it as continue to invest in the future while recognizing that some of the things that we've done in the past we can do better or do lesser.","Betsy Graseck","And your tech investments spend, am I right in thinking it's around $1.5 billion, is that is that accurate?","Andrew Cecere","Yes, so the CapEx related to technology is about $1.2 billion. And as Terry and I have talked about in the past, our operating expense related that probably another $1.5 billion. So, if you combine the two, it's just over $2.5 billion, but the CapEx that we talked about is $1.2 billion.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. Okay. And so that line kind of holds in, but then the headcount or occupancy associated with these other things you're talking about pullback that's the push-pull in the line items?","Terrance Dolan","Yes, that's a fair way to think about it. And just to be clear we've been at that spend level for a year and a half, two years, so that's in the numbers as we think about what we reported today.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. And then can I shift gears a little bit and just ask the thoughts around CECL. I know that's not coming into play until 1Q 2020, but I'm sure you're prepping for it and going parallel next year, so maybe you can give us some thoughts as to how you're thinking about it from an early look perspective?","Terrance Dolan","Yes, I mean as you said we're still kind of in the process of dimensioning it. 2019 is kind of our parallel year. If you end up looking across the entire industry, the entire industry is really in the process of kind of refining their models that they'll use as part of that process.","I would anticipate that we'll have better dimension around what the size of that is later this year. And of course one of the factors that comes into play is what is your outlook with respect to the economy, et cetera, as you get closer to the adoption of it. So, lot of moving parts, but we're on track. We feel good about at lease the position that we're in in terms of us being able to adopt it.","Betsy Graseck","And are there areas you think there's a little give back because some of these ratios look pretty high. Part of it is because we've got very low losses right now, but I'm also wondering if you know there's some parts of the portfolio which could be a net giver of reserves as opposed to a taker?","Terrance Dolan","Yes, that's the interesting thing about CECL, it is very product dependent in terms of within the company, in terms of what the impact of it's going to be. To the extent that you have longer live or longer duration assets like mortgages and that type of product, you're going to actually have a bigger negative impact or increasing the reserve that's going to come into play.","The area kind of -- to me it's a little counterintuitive, but commercial real estate is one of those -- especially on a construction site where you tend to get a little bit of benefit. But we really have to kind of look at the total mix. It's a little bit of a moving dynamic.","Betsy Graseck","Got it, okay. Thank you.","Andrew Cecere","Thanks Betsy.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Andrew Cecere","Hey Mike.","Mike Mayo","Hi. You mentioned digital banking quite a bit -- the digital platform; you've disclosed that you have 18 million customers, if that's correct in prior annual reports. Can you tell us the percentage of customers for online and the percentage of customers that use mobile banking? I think your other five large bank peers all disclosed this and it be great if you could give that to us, not now, then sometime in the future?","Andrew Cecere","I can give it to you now. So, we have 18 million total customers. If I exclude single service customers, so some of our mortgage customers, card customers, and indirect customers who outside our market -- what they would call full banking customers were about 11 million and of 11 million about 50% use our digital platform.","Mike Mayo","And how many -- what percent mobile?","Andrew Cecere","The majority of that is mobile.","Mike Mayo","Okay, great. I got my wish. -- And you've got one price for doing well and one price for not doing so well just follow-up on those two other issues. So when it comes to deposit growth, when we look year-over-year, it still doesn't look great. So, I guess that would kind of neutralize the seasonal aspects. And so I get the one-off merger -- the client lost in deposits and then some other ins and outs, is there anything else going on there? Maybe just what's your forecast for deposit growth over the next year or so?","Terrance Dolan","Yes, I mean I think we've kind of covered all the dynamics that are taking place. On a year-over-year basis, again, the decline is 100% related to this part of our customer. Consumer deposits are growing. When we think about 2019, we do expect growth in deposits and I think that'll be kind of consistent with low single-digits. It will be kind of tied to economic growth, et cetera. But I don't think that we -- there's any unusual sort of dynamics that we haven't talked about.","Mike Mayo","Okay. Then on the positive side, the loan growth -- commercial loan growth, and I noticed been a lot of questions on that. And I'm just trying to get the main takeaway, are you executing better or are you taking more risk? Or is it simply mix if you were to characterize that, kind of what's the main -- a lot more cautious.","Andrew Cecere","Yes, I want to be real clear on one thing it's not taking any more risk. Our credit box has not changed at all and we've been very prudent and strict around and disciplined for a long time and that is not changing at all.","I think it's a function of all the things we talked about. It's expanding our customer base, gaining market share, it's our diversified portfolio. It's not in any one area or geography, it's a function of all those things. And that's why we're feeling pretty good about it going forward.","Mike Mayo","And you open up a new office in the New York area. Are there some other newer offices that are getting traction that's helping with that commercial?","Andrew Cecere","Yes, we've opened up a few offices in the south, the Dallas area and the south -- and the southeast New York. We'll look at other opportunities like this and it's typically leveraging presence that we already have in the market. And we talked about that also thinking about our consumer expansion doing the same, building a customer base that we already have.","Mike Mayo","Great. all right. Thank you.","Andrew Cecere","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. Two questions. One if you look at merchant processing, it's kind of an anomaly in the growth rates. If you look at over last year, its 4% growth quarter-over-quarter. If you look at sequentially annualized, it's the 5% growth, so looks like an acceleration there. But if you look at year-to-date, it's only growing 3%. So, it's kind of strange how those three numbers all kind of working, but is there really -- is the momentum finally picking up here in essence what we are seeing same-store sales and we're seeing some retail purchases and we're getting that lift from the economy we've been waiting on for so long?","Terrance Dolan","Yes, we have been looking at the dynamics. We certainly are seeing a lift from consumer spending getting stronger. Our sales volumes have been quite strong in that 8% sort of range if you will.","The biggest issue on kind of in terms of both year-over-year growth and then kind of how it started to accelerate is really the fact that a year ago, we're starting to overlap the joint ventures that we had -- we've kind of talked a little bit about. But the overall business we've been making some investments in terms of both capabilities, industry verticals, variety of different things which I think as we kind of think about the future is going to continue to enable us to be able to expand revenue.","Marty Mosby","We saw one of your peers yesterday actually announced restructuring in the securities portfolio to accelerate that 100 to 125 basis points of net difference between the market and the portfolio rates. Any consideration since that's already kind of being taken out of tangible book value anyway in the mark-to-market that you just go ahead and realize that loss you know take it -- there was an extraordinary towards into this year and then accelerate the benefit in essence of what you get from what the market's going to give you over the next couple of years.","Terrance Dolan","Yes, I mean short answer is we really don't have any plans to restructure our investment portfolio at this time.","Andrew Cecere","And we've been managing to optimize it all along, right?","Terrance Dolan","Yes.","Marty Mosby","Have you -- you have excess capital, so given the excess capital that you have it is a way to temporarily deploy it and actually accelerate the benefit while locking in rates. We wake up six months from now and all of sudden rates have somehow fallen back down, you kind of lose that opportunity or that window. So, I just was curious since it's already marked and you got to extra capital anyway, if that wouldn't be something that you couldn't lock in those higher rates why you got them?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. Well, like I said, we don't necessarily have any particular plans to do it so.","Marty Mosby","Okay, thanks.","Terrance Dolan","Yes.","Andrew Cecere","Thanks Marty.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Your next question comes from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Kevin Barker","Good morning.","Andrew Cecere","Good morning Kevin,","Terrance Dolan","Hey Kevin.","Kevin Barker","Just a follow-up on some of the deposit flows and some of the deposit questions you mentioned, the movement out of non-interest-bearing deposits specifically around the commercial deposits, do you have any offsets on fee income specifically around treasury management that could increase fee income as some of the balances come off of non-interest-bearing deposits?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. I don't necessarily -- I can't necessarily kind of point to something like that. I mean I do think that when you end up looking -- and a lot of people end up talking about compensating balances as kind of being that offset or whatever, but I mean our core treasury management growth is about a little under 1% and the drag is really related to the rising rate environment, but there's nothing that I would specifically point to Kevin.","Kevin Barker","Okay. And then just to follow-up on the expense side. Your expense growth was below your long-term target this quarter on a year-over-year basis, I think you pointed to about 3% to 5% long-term target on year over year and obviously there's some puts and takes associated with the tax accrual and the amortization. But when you look out into the first half of 2019 and maybe in full year 2019, you think it's possible you could see expense growth run below your long-term target and maybe for the foreseeable future?","Terrance Dolan","Kevin it depends a bit on the revenue side of the equations. So, we're managing the company for positive operating leverage and we'll manage expenses as we think about it consistent with the revenue opportunities. So, the numbers aren\u2019t going to be specific, it's going to be relative to what we think on the revenue side.","Kevin Barker","Okay, all right. That's all I had. Thank you.","Terrance Dolan","Thanks Kevin.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Andrew Cecere","Hey Vivek.","Operator","Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan, please go ahead, your line is open.","Vivek Juneja","Yes. Can you hear me? Sorry.","Andrew Cecere","Yes, yes we can hear you. Thank you. Good morning.","Vivek Juneja","Sorry. Thanks. Sorry to go back to the expense question. Just trying to understand Andy -- Terry, the $377 million, here you it will go up $40 million or so for the seasonal increase, but -- so should we think of that $377 million as a good run rate going forward, is there anything like you talked about a legal accrual changes, is there anything like that that's unusual that we need to factor in as we think about -- I know beyond 2018, I mean is this really the new base?","Terrance Dolan","Yes, I mean I think Erika kind of talked a little bit about the averages associated with other expenses. I mean other expenses tends to be a little bit lumpy. It depends upon what businesses are growing, foreclosure, reserves, -- foreclosure or costs and those types of things in terms of how those are changing.","So, I would say that the $377 million is probably on the lower end of that band. And -- so when you kind of think about the future, I really think looking at kind of the averages associated with other expenses is probably a reasonable way to look at it.","Vivek Juneja","Okay, great. Similar one on the other income side. You called out private equity gains, that's also -- that number is also running above if you look at last six quarter average, which is more like $191 million or $226 million. Again how much of it was private equity and what's a good set of run rate to think about?","Terrance Dolan","Yes, so more of that was really related to the tax credit syndications that we were able to do in the third quarter. And again in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, those tend to be a little bit stronger; it will tend to be a little bit stronger. Now, we have the opportunity to be able to do that if we think about a kind of a full year basis because of the fact that we have a very good and strong production base of tax credit and because we can't -- we don't have the capacity to use all of them, we have the option to be able to syndicate them.","So, I think when you think about on a full year basis, there is kind of a little bit of a step-up associated with it, but it tends to be a little lumpy in the third and fourth quarter because of the -- just the timing of when that production occurs.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. Okay, great. One last thing. At the Barclays Conference, you raised your long-term return on average common equity target by 100 basis points. When we do the math on the tax reform benefit, the benefit to you is 150 basis points. So, is there a plan to catch-up on that additional 50 basis points at some point?","Terrance Dolan","At the high level we announced that the tax improvement in the fourth quarter of 2017, we also announced the step-up on some spend activity, particularly related to digital and payments and so forth. So, that is -- the numbers that we talked about incorporate both sides of the equation which is what we're seeing right now.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. All right. Thanks.","Terrance Dolan","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Saul Martinez","Hey good morning guys.","Andrew Cecere","Good morning Saul.","Saul Martinez","Two quick -- couple of questions. Just changing gears a little bit. Want to ask you how you're seeing the regulatory environment quarreled has indicated that preference for prudential regulations to be based more on complexity that size, you highlighted that very recently. But do you feel like once we get the proposals out of the way for the $1 billion to 250 billion asset banks, you could see some relief for banks of your size and complexity as well?","Andrew Cecere","I'm hopeful Saul, as I think about our balance sheet, our business mix, our risk profile, our trading book which is you know minimal, all those characteristics are more like a smaller regional bank or medium-sized regional bank there like the large money center banks. So, as you know 2155 [ph] talks about the tailoring shall occur and if you think about tailoring based on risk characteristics, I'm hopeful that we'll get some relief.","Saul Martinez","Okay. Okay. And just your changing gears and I hate to beat a dead horse on the other expense question; I just want to make sure I understand it right. But I think Terry you mentioned the $377 million should be you just sort of at the lower end of what a reasonable range would be. But am I right in saying that that reasonable range should also be lower than maybe what it's been in the recent past which is average about $450 million for some of the reasons that you talked about the changes in the tax credit amortization business, lower FDIC surcharges and whatnot. But I guess is that the right way to think about it that range should be a little bit lower than what we've seen historically?","Terrance Dolan","Yes, I mean whatever your assumption is with respect to the surcharge in the future, I mean that's kind of where that ends up getting the impact. I mean your point is well taken I think that I wouldn\u2019t just focus on other expenses though. I'd focus on how we're managing the overall expenses. We've got opportunity with respect to the plans and risk programs and mortgage servicing and a whole variety of different things. So, I know there's been -- and I think my horse might be dead. I wouldn\u2019t just focus on other expenses, let's put it that way.","Saul Martinez","All right. No, point taken. Thanks a lot.","Terrance Dolan","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning Andy. Good morning Terry.","Andrew Cecere","Good morning Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you guys to share with us -- when we go back and look at your non-interest-bearing deposits to total deposits during the 1994-1995 tightening cycle or even to the 2004 to 2006 tightening cycle, they held in pretty constant. Particularly in 2004 to 2006, you really didn't lose much in non-interest-bearing deposits. Can you give us some color? Do you think your mix is similar to those time periods? I know Andy, you've obviously -- both of you have been in the bank a long time, maybe you can share with us some comparisons to those time periods?","Andrew Cecere","Yes Gerard, I don't think our mix is all that different. I do think in those time periods, we were in the midst of acquiring corporate trust businesses that they have impacted the activity in the deposits because we were growing -- we've done 22 acquisitions in corporate trust over the years, many of them in the years that you describe. So, that may be a factor in the comps.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then following up on regulatory. I know you guys have done everything required from your BSA\/AML issues; can you just give us an update on where that stands now?","Andrew Cecere","We have. We completed our activity and our verification from an internal standpoint on June 30th consistent with our schedule. It now sits with the regulators and we're hopeful.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. And just one quick question. What's the duration of the securities portfolio?","Andrew Cecere","Yes, the duration is about four years.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Brian Klock","Good morning.","Andrew Cecere","Good morning Brian.","Brian Klock","So, I promise I won't ask anything about other expenses. I know that you guys talk about the average commercial real estate loan growth and it seems like maybe even some of the headwinds that others have seen in the industry, the pay downs and those sort of headwinds might be abating, but it seems like on end of period basis, I look at page 20 of your sup, if I'm right, commercial real estate loans, the first time you end of period loans have actually grown since the first -- or third quarter of 2016. I'm just wondering is there anything that you're saying is this sort of the inflection point when you think about overall end of period balance growth going forward.","Terrance Dolan","Yes. It\u2019s a good question. We certainly hope that it is. The end of looking at commercial real estate as we said, pay downs were particularly strong. Before tax reform, a lot of commercial real estate developers were derisking, taking a lot of things off -- a lot of their chips off the table and they were paying down and then they had the uptrend to be in the capital market space. So, those were definitely some headwinds.","We haven't necessarily changed -- we haven't changed with respect to our credit box. We're still not -- we're not doing anything crazy from a structural standpoint. So, we are optimistic that it is at an inflection point and no, big part of it is just the pay downs that we saw earlier in the year and have really started to slow.","Brian Klock","Got it. Thanks for that. And just trying to triangulate -- I haven't tried to put it back through my model yet, but the big picture guidance you gave for the fourth quarter, it seems like it's implying at least a continued upward trend -- really flattish to upward in the NIM. I know you don't give NIM guidance, but is that a fair assumption even with your beta assumptions that the NIM could be better in the fourth quarter than the third?","Terrance Dolan","Yes. Well, as we said, I mean when we think about the opportunity for NIM to expand, we still think there's opportunity for expansion.","Brian Klock","Great. Thanks for your time guys.","Andrew Cecere","Thanks Brian.","Terrance Dolan","Thank you.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters for any closing remarks.","Jenn Thompson","That concludes our earnings call.

Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Andy Cecere, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon Eastern Time through Wednesday July 25, at midnight. I will now turn the conference call over to Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. Please go ahead.","Judith T. Murphy","Thank you, Holly, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's second quarter 2012 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analysts' schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.","I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings on file with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Richard.","Richard K. Davis","Thanks, Judy, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to share our record quarterly results with you this morning, and I'll begin with the highlights on Page 3 of our presentation.","U.S. Bancorp reported record net income of $1.4 billion for the second quarter of 2012 or $0.71 per diluted common share. Total net revenue was higher by 8.1% over the same quarter of 2011, driven by 6.6% growth in net interest income and 9.7% growth in fee revenue.","As importantly, we achieved positive operating leverage on both a year-over-year and linked quarter basis. The total average loans grew year-over-year and linked quarter by 7.7% and 1.9% respectively, and we experienced strong loan growth in total average deposits -- strong growth in total average deposits of 10.5% over the prior year and 1.3% linked quarter. Credit quality continued to improve as net charge-offs declined by 8.9% from the prior quarter and non-performing assets decreased in total by 6.9% or 12.3% including covered assets.","We generated significant capital this quarter through earnings and ended the quarter with a Basel I Tier 1 common equity ratio of 8.8% and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.7%.","We repurchased 13 million shares of common stock during the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date share buyback total to 29 million shares. Since the beginning of the year, we have returned 62% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Trends in our industry-leading performance metrics are shown on Slide 4. Return on average assets in the second quarter was 1.67%, and return on average common equity was 16.5%. Our company's long-term goal is to achieve a normalized ROA in the range of 1.6% to 1.9% and an ROE between 16% and 19%. Both performance ratios are within their respective ranges.","Our net interest margin and efficiency ratio are shown in the graph on the right side of Slide 4. This quarter's net interest margin of 3.58% was 9 basis points lower than the same quarter of last year and, as expected, a few basis points lower than the prior quarter. And Andy will discuss the margin in more detail in a few minutes.","Our efficiency ratio for the second quarter was 51.1%, lower than both the prior year and previous quarter, and we expect this ratio will remain in the low 50s.","Turning to Slide 5. The company reported total net revenue in the second quarter of $5.1 billion, an increase of 8.1% over the prior year's quarter and 2.8% higher than the previous quarter. The company's net revenue benefited from growth in both our balance sheet and fee-based business lines. And mortgage banking and payments were particularly strong this quarter.","Our growth in average loan and deposit balances is shown on Slide 6. Average total loans outstanding increased by $15.3 billion or 7.7% year-over-year. As expected, linked quarter growth in an average total loans accelerated slightly from the previous quarter as balances grew 1.9% compared with the first quarter's linked quarter growth of 1.5%.","Excluding covered loans, our runoff portfolio, average total loans grew by 10% year-over-year and 2.4% linked quarter. The increase in average loans outstanding was primarily due once again to strong growth in commercial loans, which grew by 23.2% year-over-year and 6% over the prior quarter. Residential real estate loans also showed strong growth, 19.6% over the same quarter of last year and 3.5% over the prior quarter. Consumer lending was more muted, with the exception of auto loans and leases, which have been showing solid growth for a number of quarters.","We continue to originate and renew new loans and lines for our customers. New originations excluding mortgage production plus new and renewed commitments total over $45.5 billion this quarter.","Total revolving corporate and commercial commitments outstanding increased year-over-year by 24.3% and 3.7% on a linked quarter basis, while utilization remains fairly consistent at approximately 25%. This increase in commitments, coupled with the quarter's strong commercial loan growth, indicates that we're continuing to gain market share.","Total average deposits increased by $21.9 billion or 10.5% over the same quarter of last year, while total average deposits grew by $3 billion on a linked quarter basis or 1.3%.","Turning to Slide 7, in credit quality. Total net charge-offs in the second quarter declined by 8.9% from the first quarter of 2012, while non-performing assets decreased by 6.9%, or 12.3%, including covered assets. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 0.98%, improving from the 1.09% recorded in the first quarter and now below the 1% through this cycle net charge-off rate that we expect given the current mix of our loan portfolio.","Turning to Slide 8. As the graph on the left illustrates, early- and late-stage delinquencies, excluding covered assets, improved again this quarter. On the right-hand side of Slide 8, you will see that the positive trend in criticized assets also continued. Both of these statistics provide us with confidence that net charge-offs and non-performing assets will once again trend modestly lower in the third quarter of 2012.","Given the second quarter's improvement in credit quality and our expectation that this improvement will continue going forward, we released $50 million of reserves compared with $90 million in the first quarter and $175 million in the second quarter of last year.","I will now turn the call over to Andy.","Andrew Cecere","Thanks, Richard. Slide 9 gives you a view of our second quarter 2012 results compared to various comparable time periods. Record diluted EPS of $0.71 was 18.3% higher than the second quarter of 2011 and 6% higher than the prior quarter.","Slide 10 lists the key drivers of the company's second quarter earnings. The $212 million or 17.6% increase in net income year-over-year was the result of an 8.1% increase in net revenue and a decrease in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a 7.3% increase in noninterest expense.","Net interest income increased year-over-year by $169 million or 6.6%. The increase was largely driven by a $26.2 billion or 9.4% increase in average earning assets, in addition to strong growth in low-cost deposits.","The growth in average earning assets included planned increases in the securities portfolio and growth in average total loans, as well as loans held for sale, partially offset by a lower cash position at the Fed.","A net interest margin of 3.58% was 9 basis points lower than the same quarter of last year, primarily due to the expected increase in lower-yielding investment securities and a decrease in loan yields, partially offset by lower cash balances at the Fed and lower deposit costs.","Noninterest income increased by 9.7% year-over-year. Mortgage banking revenues was very strong again this quarter as production increased by 150% year-over-year and gain on sale margins improved. These positive variances in mortgage banking and several other major categories were partially offset by a 17.8% decrease in credit and debit card fees due to legislative changes to debit card interchange. Offsetting the impact of this unfavorable change in debit card fees was legislative-related mitigation activity, including the final elimination of the unused rewards and higher overall transaction volumes.","Noninterest expense was higher year-over-year by $176 million or 7.3%. The majority of the increase can be attributed to higher compensation and benefits expense, an increase in professional services primarily due to foreclosure review and other expense, which included an accrual related to the Visa settlement. This accrual accounts for the temporary reduction interchange included in the settlement terms.","Net income was higher on a linked quarter basis by $77 million or 5.8%. This favorable variance was the result of a 2.8% increase in net revenue and a 2.3% decrease in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a 1.6% increase in noninterest expense.","On a linked quarter basis, net interest income was higher by $23 million or just under 1%. Average earning assets grew by $3.7 billion, and net interest margin was, as expected, 2 basis points lower than the prior quarter, as the negative impact from the repricing of the investment securities portfolio and slightly lower loan yields were offset by a reduction in cash balances at the Fed and the positive impact from repricing of maturing debt.","The average balance on our investment securities portfolio was $73.2 billion in the second quarter, $10.2 billion higher than the second quarter of 2011 and $1.7 billion higher than the previous quarter.","During the second quarter, we transferred approximately $12 billion of securities from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity, reflecting our intention to keep these securities until maturity and subsequently reducing the volatility of OCI going forward. Assuming stable cash balances and the current Basel III liquidity requirements, we expect to maintain the investment securities portfolio at or around this level for the next few quarters.","Also, given the net interest rate environment, we expect net interest margin to be fairly stable in the second half of 2012, as repricing pressure on the securities portfolio is offset by the benefit of a reduction in funding cost as higher-cost debt matures and is replaced by lower-price debt and\/or deposits.","On a linked quarter basis, noninterest income was higher by $116 million or 5.2%. This favorable variance was primarily the result of strong growth in payments and mortgage banking as well as increases in the majority of other fee categories. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense was higher by $41 million or 1.6%, primarily due to the Visa settlement accrual and mortgage servicing review project, partially offset by lower marketing business development expense.","Turning to Slide 11. Our capital position remains strong and continues to grow. We have included estimates of our Tier 1 common equity-to-risk-weighted asset ratio using the Basel III proposed rules published both before and after June 7. Based on our preliminary assessment of the full impact of the proposed rules for the Basel III standardized approach released for comments in June, we have estimated that our Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio was approximately 7.9% at June 30 versus the 8.4% estimated at March 31 under the prior proposal.","The reduction in our estimated ratio was primarily the result of an increase in risk-weighted assets under the newly proposed rules of approximately 7%. At 7.9%, we are both well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement but slightly below our targeted ratio of approximately 8%, which includes a cushion for a yet-to-be-defined SIFI buffer and our own internal buffer. We expect to reach our target ratio during the third quarter.","Slide 12 provides updated detail on the company's mortgage repurchase related expense and the reserve for expected losses on repurchases and make-whole payments. Our outstanding repurchases and make-whole request balance at June 30 was $164 million, compared with $134 million at March 31.","As you may recall, we increased our mortgage reps and warranty reserve in the first quarter of 2012 in response to changes we had seen in the GSE sampling method. During the second quarter of 2012, we accrued $45 million and believe the level of reserves at June 30 is appropriate. We continue to expect mortgage repurchase requests to remain fairly stable over the next several quarters.","I will now turn the call back to Richard.","Richard K. Davis","Thanks, Andy. So to conclude our formal remarks, let me turn your attention to Slide 13. The momentum continues this quarter and hopefully beyond. We grew our balance sheet and customer base and we gained market share. We grew net revenue, we achieved record earnings and industry-leading performance metrics for the quarter, as well as positive operating leverage. We continue to invest in our businesses, and we saw our credit quality continue to improve. Our capital and liquidity positions remain strong and they're growing. And we've returned 62% of our earnings year-to-date to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks.","Our company continues to invest for the long term in our diverse and stable mix of businesses, products and services and in our employees and in the communities that we serve. Consistent, predictable and repeatable. Our straightforward approach to doing business has allowed to deliver industry-leading performance and returns to our shareholders, and we look forward to doing more of the same during the rest of 2012 and the years to come.","That concludes our formal remarks, Andy, Bill Parker and I will be happy to answer questions from the audience.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Erika Penala, Bank of America.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question is for Andy. Could you walk us through, in terms of the components, margin stability for the back half of the year? And I guess, my more detailed question underneath that is, could you give us a sense of how much debt is maturing in the second half and at what rate and what replacement rate you're assuming, as well as, I notice on an end-of-period basis, the cash balances were actually up, what size bond portfolio you're assuming for the rest of the year?","Andrew Cecere","Okay, Erika. So the key moving parts are the negative is the investment securities reinvestment risk, and the offset to that is the debt repricing, which will be at a lower cost, replaced by either additional debt issuance and\/or deposits. The differential of those 2 things is essentially causing us to be -- to have an expectation of neutrality in net interest margin for the rest of the year. In terms of the cash balance, Erika, any day there's fluctuations in that cash balances. And I'd like to look at it more at the average for the quarter, which was down from about $4 billion in the first quarter to about $1.5 billion in the second quarter. And again, the level of loan growth and deposit growth is fairly stable, as you saw in the second quarter. So I would expect a little movement around that but not substantial.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You don't happen to have the dollar number of the debt maturing and the rate at which it's maturing for the second half of the year, do you?","Andrew Cecere","I do have that. In the second quarter -- in the third quarter, we have about $6 billion maturing, and I would say the debt that's coming off versus what's coming on is favorable right around 100 basis points.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And my last question before I step away from the queue relates to CCAR. I guess perhaps it's too early to tell, but now that the NPR proposal is out, do you anticipate that the CCAR is going to take into account Basel III ratios rather than Basel I when thinking about approving capital return for the banks next year?","Andrew Cecere","Well as you know, Erika, the last CCAR actually took into consideration both Basel I and Basel III. It was Basel III under the stressed environment and -- Basel I under the stressed environment and Basel III under sort of the glide path. And I would expect a similar sort of set-up constraints in the new one next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom, RBC Capital Markets.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A question for maybe Richard or Bill on Slide 7, the credit trends. Richard, you've talked about this concept of the industry over-earning in the past.","Richard K. Davis","Yes.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And just curious if you'd be willing to take a stab at going below 1%. How long does this phenomenon last and how low can the charge-offs potentially go for the company? Just kind of big picture would be helpful.","Richard K. Davis","Yes. I'll start and Bill can clean up. The 0.98% is about where I thought we'd be right about now because in the last few years, we and the others have not been taking much risk on lending, which is probably, at end of the day, what we are supposed to do but have to be very careful. I think that we stay below 100 basis points for a few quarters just because the math of it says that we don't have any loans that would be coming to some point of stress, I don\u2019t believe, in the next couple of quarters based on our prudent underwriting of the last year or so. I will say, you'll remember that we have a credit card, fairly important credit card book, that does affect our overall ratios, and that's probably the one that's coming now to its most nearest bottom, where it'll start to move up probably sooner than the rest of the portfolios. But for the rest of it, I think we're going to stay under 1 for a while. My hope is that based on appropriate accounting trends that we can continue to have a certain level of unallocated reserves remaining so that we don't find ourselves releasing reserves to a point of unsustainable performance only to have to build them back as things start to move up. I'll also close by saying I don't think the 0.98% falls to anything like 0.5 or 0.6. I think it floats around the high 8s and high, midpoint 9s, but it probably eventually gets above 1. And I'll actually be looking forward to that because that means we've been optimal in doing the right risk\/reward balance and making sure that we're taking the right risks and rewards for our customers. But I would say it's another few quarters and not very aggressive in its movement from here. Bill, do you want to add?","P. W. Parker","Yes, I'll just say, John, that how long it stays below 1 and how low it goes is in a large part a function of how strong the economy is. If it stays at this very moderate growth level, that's positive. But we wouldn't necessarily see that loss rate go way down, given the continued high unemployment rate. But if we do enter into a very robust economic growth and see unemployment go way down, see loan growth go way up, then clearly, we could get a much lower rate. But a large part of it remains a function of the economy.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just to follow up on that, obviously, the pipelines are strong. But are you sensing any incremental borrower caution or any potential changes in activity between now and the end of the year?","Richard K. Davis","Yes, a little bit. This is Richard. I like to characterize things in quarters. So I think quarter 4 was a pretty strong ending as it related to our customers' sense of things. Quarter 1 remains strong for a quarter at the beginning of the year. And then quarter 2, I'd say the last month that quarter 2 started to taper off a bit in terms of appetite for risk. No surprise, but as you think about it, we're getting close to a number of moments. We're coming close to the election. We're coming closer to the fiscal cliff decision. We're certainly not getting better news from Europe as it relates to the confidence of our customers. And then the economy isn't strengthening. It's not falling apart, either. It's just not getting better. So I would say that we saw slight tempering in the end of quarter 2, and I think we'll continue to see that between now and the solution that is in the opting [ph] for any of those outcomes, particularly the election, the fiscal cliff, which at least have deadlines on them as we all know. For us, as it relates to our loan growth, we're 1.5% linked quarter in quarter 1, 1.9% for quarter 2. Our current forecast shows us pretty steady to that level where we've been right now. So I don\u2019t think we're going to see a ramp up, but we're certainly not seeing things go backwards. But our customers' behavior, both on their continued decision to take on commitments that they are not using and their caution in not extending themselves in places that they're not comfortable continues to remain. And that story is kind of just more of the same, with a slightly negative bias to their confidence.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers, Sandler O'Neill.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess a couple of questions. First just generally on mortgage. Another pretty strong quarter, and you guys obviously have beefed up in that business pretty considerably over last couple of years or few years. So just curious, anecdotally your thoughts on how long it can stay strong given the rate environment and any additional opportunities you might see there.","Richard K. Davis","Yes. This is Rich. I'll go first. We know that this is an unsustainable moment in time because refis are so robust. They're about 2\/3 of our originations right now. And with interest rates this low, they're not going to stay there forever. So we're going to continue to enjoy the benefits that accrue to a high-quality producer like we are with a good brand, and we're not going to withhold any opportunities that come along. But we're not building this church for Easter. There are number of things we're doing to make sure that we have the right people and the right processes in place. But we're also building with a certain level of temporariness as things will eventually start to flatten out. I think our market share will continue to grow as it has as much for our own efforts as it has been the changing in the marketplace. And I think in the future, say, 3 years forward, when there is a more normalized environment, we should have very significant market share of a more traditional new home market business for which we will build an infrastructure that can withstand that and grow with it but not put ourselves over our skis at moments like this, where it's probably not sustainable. I'll have Andy talk a little more about the margins we're getting right now. And you're right, the pipeline is strong in quarter 3. It looks a lot like quarter 2.","Andrew Cecere","Right. So you know, as Richard mentioned, about 70% of our activity in the first quarter was refinancing, and that dropped to low 60s in the second quarter. Gain-on-sale margins fell a bit from about 2.30% to about 2.18% from quarter 1 and quarter 2. So our expectation for quarter 3 is a similar volume, perhaps a little bit of further pressure on gain-on-sale margins. And then again, fourth quarter is going to depend a little bit about where rates are at that time.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. It's helpful. I appreciate that. And I just wanted to ask another question. You guys are in the journal, I guess it was yesterday or today on that Los Angeles lawsuit. And you've talked about sort of the market confusion regarding being a trustee versus actually owning some places when these lawsuits come up. I was just curious if you had any thoughts on that most recent one?","Richard K. Davis","Yes. I do. Besides the fact that I hate it, is the -- we don't own any of those properties. And it's a classic case of misinformation and the confusions created by the role of the trustee. The trust owns these RMBS. But in turn, they're owned by the investors, and we have a limited duty as a trustee. And in fact, we don't have any rights to go in and touch the properties. And while that doesn't pass the test in the public jury, it is accurate and it's the way the trustees were built. We have in this particular case since they had their bully pulpit yesterday for wholly incorrect information. I guess I have mine now to say that none of the information that they have provided was accurate. We've been working with them for 18 months to try to understand what they really wanted, and we're even willing, above the duties of our responsibility, to connect with the servicers and help try to figure out where these properties are falling into disrepair and to no avail. For the record, we have 46 of those properties in LA County, for which they were actually -- we can get our hands on, and U.S. Bank owns only 18 properties outright in the LA County that are foreclosed, and every single one of them, with pictures to evidence, are in good shape and in great repair. So we will continue to manage this through the courts and do our good duty of making sure that people understand the role of the trustee. But I think at this point, it's disappointing but it's not altogether surprising because, if it's not here, it's sometimes in bankruptcies or other places where the bank gets tagged as the owner or the creator of the problem, and we just have to go back through the right courses to explain our position. And usually we don\u2019t have to do that after a press conference, but we will have to do that this time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin, Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Richard, I was wondering if you give us a little more color on other parts of the loan book. I noticed that commercial mortgage grew a little faster this quarter. If you can walk us through that. And also your appetite for continuing to build the residential mortgage portfolio. I know it's a relatively still small percentage but just from an asset liability perspective, if you can give us some color on that.","Richard K. Davis","Yes, a little color on all of it. So our loan growth in the C&I market business was actually strong, and I'm happy to report across the board 6% linked quarter, and it was all the way from small business, including SBA, up to middle-market and all the way up to large corporate. In terms of markets, we said last time and we'll say it again, we're not seeing a real distinction across geographies except in commercial real estate, where the coasts are stronger for reasons that make sense, I think, than some of the markets in the Midwest. Our investment in all these businesses can continue to be attractive to me because it's an opportunity for us to slightly and quietly move market share get opportunities with business with other customers we haven't had before it. Namely, on the more corporate side, I would say our growth is first and foremost, our own new marketing efforts and being more -- invited to more opportunities, including syndicated deals and now the chance with Capital Markets to lead many of those deals. Second in order would be our own customers giving us more of their business, and third, and probably the diminishing level from prior quarters, would be the benefit of the European banks starting to retreat. In the other parts of the market it's just old-fashioned market share and customers giving us more business. And in Commercial Real Estate, it happens to be a business we're very good at. We have, as you know, from stress test results to prior quarters review, we have a very good book and an amazingly strong team. So that probably is a place where without a European benefit so much, we've been getting invited to a lot more opportunities because I think we said no to a lot of people in the last cycle, and as much as they might have hated it then, they're back saying, \"Look, you said no when it was easier to say yes and the fact is I suspect you're going to take care of me all the time because your best interest must be mine, so let's sit down and talk.\" And I'm going to continue to see growth in Commercial Real Estate, which is what I think you're seeing a bit latent. CRE is always late, last in and last out, and I think we're getting the benefit that we saw with C&I a couple of quarters later. So Bill, I'll stop there and turn it to you in terms of more color around the loan book.","P. W. Parker","Yes. In terms of the mortgage, obviously, there's not a lot of construction activity other than multifamily. We do have a fairly robust multifamily construction pipeline. But on the mortgage side, we have a lot of large institutional customers, a lot of REITs. There's been a lot of repositioning of Class A properties, and we're more than willing and able to provide financing to those institutional clients for that mortgage category.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Got it. My second question, just to put it to the deposit side for a second. Continued good growth, and I'm just wondering, is it from new customer adds? Are you seeing any flight-to-quality benefit? And also just a little color on this broker\/dealer list that you saw on the large time deposit category?","Andrew Cecere","Yes. It's across all those categories. We're seeing good growth in our retail customer base across the branches and savings account principally. The DDA growth is principally driven by wholesale as well as our Corporate Trust business, which is a great source of DDA deposits. And we have a very robust broker\/dealer group that will have fluctuations up and down. But from a core basis, in terms of long-standing deposits, those are growing across the board.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And last little nitpicky one, just the professional services was up on some mortgage-related stuff that's been elevated in the past. Can you just explain that and then talk about like is this going to be just a continued kind of elevated type of expense that we're going to have to deal with just until all of the stuff is settled out?","Andrew Cecere","Yes, Ken. So that is principally due to the mortgage consent order review that many banks are facing. It's a third-party review that's going on. It cost us just over $50 million in the second quarter. We would expect a similar level in the third quarter and then start to fall off in quarter 4 and going into 2013.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Ketron, UBS.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Richard, maybe a question for you on the Visa MasterCard litigation and maybe your view on that. It looked like you have accrued some charges for the quarter. But maybe how the settlement plays out for U.S. Bancorp, especially given the fact there could have been a larger negative overhang as the year progressed. And now it looks like, for the most part, it has been resolved.","Richard K. Davis","Yes. So I'll talk about a settlement that seemingly nobody likes. After 7 years, you would have thought we got that right. As you know, we are not a party to that directly, but we are influenced by the outcome. And in fact even if we were a party, we would have been allowing Visa and MasterCard to do our bidding. In this case, I think the settlement itself was acceptable because first and foremost, we have, like other banks, have a great deal of money reserved for this particular lawsuit for many years especially once they both became public companies. And that money for the most part was used for this and that's what we wanted it to be used for. The overhang of 10 basis points for 8 months, as you can see, we accrued for that, so that's now behind us. I do worry that it might pierce the veil in terms of what merchants will want to do on month 9. So I think we need to keep our eyes open and make sure that, that satisfies the Court's requirement. And we will also have 8 months to see whether that money actually does get passed along to consumers or to retailers or where it goes. And then probably the trump card, Greg, biggest issue is the surcharging and the permission now that's granted. As you know, AMEX doesn't have that opportunities. So it will be interesting to watch between those issuers, between MasterCard and Visa versus AMEX, how that plays out. And I do think it's very interesting and provocative to see what kind of actions the retailers will take because typically surcharging is a negative feeling and impact to consumers, and I would suspect that most of them probably won't jump on it. Lastly, and you know what I've read, but there -- it's not final. They still have an opt-out opportunity, so it'll be interesting if all the large merchants and some of the chains of, say, the fast food chains or the convenience store chains, all accept this or not because it may in part be just a starting point to the continuing saga that's now 7 years old. So I don\u2019t expect it to be conclusive. I think we have a lot to watch. I actually appreciate the extra time we'll have even over the holidays to see how this all plays out. And it's not going to be hugely material to U.S. Bank. We're also an acquirer so at the end of the day, there is some counter hedging benefits to whatever the solution is. But I think it's a very instructive to watch. And it's very different than Durbin. It had nothing to do with congressional oversight. It had nothing to do with customers weighing in on it. This is a retailer versus card business, and I think it's got probably halfway through the game. We'll see how it goes in the next couple of months.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. I appreciate your insight. And Andy, on margin, when you look at the average cost of interest-bearing deposits, it was down about 43 basis points for the second quarter. Do you think there's appreciably more room to down price as we work our way through the rest of this year and into 2013?","Andrew Cecere","Yes, Greg, there's some room. You think about that average, that includes some deposits that are very low. Some are between 3 and 5 basis points, and then some are well above the 40 basis points. And the opportunity would be for those set of deposits that are above 40, and we still have some room there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby, Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I had a question -- 2 questions about this overall economic activity. If you're looking at -- just curious on Page 6. If you look at the deposit growth and you kind of work from third quarter to second quarter, we're seeing deposit growth go from 18% down to 10.5%. On the other side, you got loan growth growing up from 5% to almost 8%. So the gap between those, while we're not seeing a big shift in dollars, the growth rate gap is closing. That's gone from about 13% down to about 3%. And I just know given the kind of position you all have in the marketplace and the growth that you're seeing on the revenue side, do you think that this is related to kind of some underlying tones to the economic activities?","Andrew Cecere","As we talked about, Marty, your observation is correct. The differential between loan growth and deposit growth is condensing so that they're almost at the same level now. So we are at the 1.09% and the 1.3% on a linked quarter, and in fact, flipping to loan growth being a little higher. So there was a period last year where there was very limited loan activity and tremendous deposit activity as particular corporations were building liquidity on their balance sheet, and effectively on our balance sheet. That seems to have slowed and sort of leveled out. So there's more of a balance right now, and that is sort of what we're anticipating going into the third quarter.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And so it's not really the quick shift that we've seen in the past but maybe there's a slow boil that's kind of going on underneath?","Andrew Cecere","Yes. It isn't a massive change all in one quarter, but it is over many quarters shifting a little bit. That's correct.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Would you also say given your transaction processing business, what are you seeing in the activity levels there? Is it encouraging at all? Or is -- we had a nice uptick this quarter from seasonality, but how was that relative to your expectation?","Richard K. Davis","I'd say that in terms of same-store sales, Marty, we have both a good view of the whole domestic market and even a little peek into Europe given our position over there. But year-over-year sales for our Elavon business was up 2.2% and primarily led by government, financials and apparel. Without the airlines, which is a huge portfolio for us, it's up almost 3%. On the negative side, furnishings, consumer purchases and entertainment were on the downside, are negative. So what you're seeing is I think the reduction of a long, torturously long recession with a slow recovery, where people are spending on what they have to spend on but they're probably still lagging on spending on the more discretionary benefit. And for us, the 2.2% year-over-year growth is pretty much what we thought it would be and expecting it to probably be settling into the summer months, somewhere in that same range, not getting much better, not getting much weaker. And consumers are less affected by those issues I mentioned earlier like the election and the fiscal cliff. But as we get closer to those points in time, for better or for worse, they'll start to become more engaged in that dialogue and their actions and behaviors may be affected by it. But for now, we think it's pretty steady state.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And just last question detail, you mentioned Visa accrual in a couple of places. In the press release, you say that noninterest expense was up $41 million primarily due to Visa. Can you -- what was the actual number for the Visa accrual this quarter?","Andrew Cecere","$65 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Todd Hagerman, Sterne Agee.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Richard, I have a couple of questions just in terms of the loan growth. One, in terms of the Commercial Real Estate, and you specifically referenced the multifamily opportunity pipeline. But I'm curious obviously you have more room to grow that portfolio relative to the overall size. And I'm just curious as you think about your risk balance, if you will, how do I think about just kind of that risk balance and the ongoing growth in Commercial Real Estate, multifamily in particular, how much -- where are you in terms of pricing and kind of thoughts in terms of where you want that portfolio to go, all else being equal?","Richard K. Davis","First of all, let me remind you that historically, gosh, you can go back probably a decade, we've always had a fairly large Commercial Real Estate book. So in any point in time, I'm not worried about the size of that as it compares to the size of our total assets. So we're comfortable with that because we're good at it. I have the same management team for 19 years running that business, and so I would take more opportunity, like you said. But let me jump on one thing -- multifamily. We're not always a bellwether, but we had a strong opinion 2 quarters ago, first part of the year. We felt new construction, strong as it is, is risky in overheated markets. And we've been actually walking away from deals in certain markets where we think that the total housing stock is going to be too high once you put the foreclosed properties back into the marketplace and you have what has yet to be built multifamily. So you might be disappointed or impressed, I don\u2019t know which, but we're not engaging in some of those opportunities in overheated markets particularly like Boston and Chicago, but we just think it's just too risky. So we're passing on opportunities not because the credit quality doesn't look good today. We just think that the future as we see it isn't going to be strong enough to account for it. You've got other categories, though. New housing sales, we're at historic lows and we'll continue to be light, and we're going to continue to participate with the only high-quality national builders. Office buildings, new constructions continue to be limited. Vacancy rates in the big cities are about 15%, ranging from 7% to 20%. And major suburban markets were even worse, more like 15% to 20%, so there's not a lot there but to work with your current customers, refi them or take higher position. On the retail side, there's new construction, which is virtually nonexistent unless you're building a next phase or a fill-in to finish off a project. Hotels and motels are experiencing pretty good trends right now, but new construction is still limited. Industrial, limited by the same views that C&I customers are when they're not sure what we're going to need in the future. And as I said earlier, the coasts are stronger than the middle of the country, where we have a lot of our business. So for us the growth you're seeing is an extension of invitations by customers that we've not worked with before and current customers, reducing the number of banks they're using and giving us first shot in many cases to have a higher position. Nothing magic but there's no -- I have no guard rails on this one. If the right business is there, I trust this group and our underwriting to take all that they can. I'm not concerned about the concentration, but I'm also telling you, we're not going to get probably half as much as we could have because we simply don't think it's strong enough right now to get that deep into that business.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. I am assuming again within that portfolio, you haven't changed kind of the underwriting standards in terms of what you traditionally required in the past, as you mentioned.","P. W. Parker","No, I mean, This is Bill, no we -- short answer: no, we haven't changed our underwriting standards.","Richard K. Davis","By the way -- by the way, anywhere.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then I'd just segue into the card portfolio. Again, stabilizing credit metrics over the last couple of quarters. If you could just kind of give us an update in terms of where you think that portfolio is headed at this point, if you're doing anything different from a marketing or point-of-sale customer contact position?","P. W. Parker","One of the efforts we have, which has been very successful, is telling through the branches. So we've -- obviously we've always had direct mail as a source, but we've made a point of improving our originations out of our retail branches. That gets a very high-quality customer, one that we can provide other products and services to. So that's one change we've really focused on, especially this year. And in terms of just the outlook, I mean, the credit conditions are obviously very favorable for cards right now. It's a competitive market, but the credit outlook is very strong.","Richard K. Davis","And so -- this is Richard, but we're not going to go downstream on that line. We're not going to sub-prime or near prime. We're just not going to do that. And that's probably a lot of opportunity, and I'm not even saying those doing it are making a mistake, if they get paid for. We're simply going to stay in the very prime and, as much as we can, customer-generated business, where we know our customer and that we believe that they would think that relationship is strong enough to make it first among few to be paid back. So I see it as a growth business. Our group is very good at it. We'll continue to extract more opportunity from the customers we have, but I'm not going to go into an underwriting game here to try to improve the volume.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes. The point that I was just trying to make was you're kind of within your normalized band now today. I'm just kind of more curious in terms of do you see more the growth opportunities staying within that band?","Richard K. Davis","Yes. And so I think the answer is, within that band, yes, but not to extend the band to get more.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush, NAB Research.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","Sort of a big question for you. I don't know if you listened to the Bernanke testimony yesterday. But one of the senators went through this long litany of evil deeds associated with the banking industry, including LIBOR and blowing up hedges and everything else, many of which are not directly applicable to you but unfortunately your company gets caught in that same web. But I think more ominously, we're hearing from a lot of investors who are just looking at the returns from the banking industry over not just the past several years but a very long term and just saying, you know what, the returns haven't been there. How do you remedy this? And how do you get your company out of this? \"It's a bank, therefore, I don\u2019t want to invest in it\" kind of psychology that seems to be developing pretty quickly here?","Richard K. Davis","Yes. That's a big question. And I saw parts of the testimony. If there was a long rambling senator, I probably checked out. But I will tell you the way for us to tell the story for U.S. Bank and it does derive to the entire industry eventually, but the thing you got to love about a bank, and you hate about a bank, but you love that it's an annuity, technically and literally an annuity. And unless you have big surprises, which what we're dealing with in the last couple of years, you really can pretty much bank on it, pun intended. But you know this. I mean, you've got --  you can't kill it and you can't change its course very quickly because the loan book and the deposit book move fairly slowly. But first of all you've got to ring-fence the risk and describe to your investors what those risks might be and convince them in a way you didn't used to that you have your handle on the risk and that you're not willing to take additional risks for rewards that are unsustainable. The second thing for the U.S. Bank story, and I'm preaching to the choir here, is that the derivative of our income, 50% or thereabouts, is coming from fee businesses like trusts and like payment businesses, also serves as kind of a buffer against the vagaries of interest rates and market perception. We hear only have half as much about what Bernanke is thinking about interest rates as somebody else because while they're all affected by the economy, you and I both know we have these other cylinders that provide us with this fee business, which is less consistent but also has a whole lot less variability. So ours is to tell the story of the composition of earnings, to talk about the simplicity of the business, remind them of the annuity function of it, identify the risks, call them out, ring-fence them, and let people know that we've got a pretty good handle on it and always be straightforward and as consistent as we can be. And when we have to guess -- prove that we were as close to right as possible so that next time we guess, you're going to trust it. I will say that as a ring-fence stat. [ph] The second piece goes for the industry, Nancy, I don't know that I'll be here long enough for the industry to get its legs back and the reputation it probably used to have. We have done a lot of studies. We know that people love their bankers. That's who they pick. They actually like their bank, that's what they pick. They actually hate this industry because they've been told to hate it. And every once in a while there's another break-in in the neighborhood that doesn't help. So I think we have to work from the bottom up and let each bank rehabilitate its own relationship with its customers. Eventually that will pass through. And I think high tide helps everybody. And when the economy does get better, and it will, and the banks can prove themselves to be the catalyst to that big recovery, a situation which we used to do and I think we will, just de facto be one of the reasons for it, then I think a lot of that criticism starts to fall away, and a future senator in a future hearing won't feel the need to pick on a bank for the popularity of beliefs but actually might actually thank the bank for having been there when they need it to be. But that's years away. So in the meantime, we'll mind our own business, tell our own story and cross our fingers.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","Yes. This story that's in L.A. is sort of demonstrative that it's nebulous, it's not true, but these municipalities feel that they can throw that out there and get some bucks in turn from some settlement somewhere. And as we look at the Wells Fargo settlement, we see that actually does work. I mean, how long do you think it's going to take this stuff, specifically around your company, to go away? Is it just a residual of the housing crisis and when the housing crisis turns, that kind of stuff finally goes away?","Richard K. Davis","I think the housing crisis is the original issue, but let's agree that it's basically an economy. So the weak economy causes the City of LA to have a city attorney looking for places to raise up revenue. And what they're asking us to do there is change the legal bounds upon which a trustee's responsibility because they can get to the original servicers. So the housing is the reason for the topic, and frankly, people forget that there are 3 places where people own houses. There are the GSEs, by far the majority. There are the banks that own them outright, which people spent all their time on. And then there's this private group of trusts that own the RMBSs, and no one can get to them. And there's no construct to get that group together. It's like a bad co-op getting together for their annual meeting in Apartment 16B. I mean, you can't get them together to identify where they can agree to reduce the value of their trusts in order to get the houses onto the market. So they're going to go through another door. I should only hope that it doesn't impede the original goal of the trustee because if the changes the rules of what that means, then I don't know that anybody would want to be a trustee if all the responsibility falls to them eventually through some eyes of the law, and so far that hasn't happened. But I think answering your question I think as long as the economy is weak, everybody, everywhere will seek a place where there might be a deeper pocket to try to find an opportunity, even if it's not legal, to raise the specter of question and try to find some opportunity. I'm not a settler, I don't like to settle much at all because I think right is right and I'm a fairness doctrine guy. At the end of the day, I'll settle if it's better for my shareholders, but not at all in the first, second or third pass because it's just wrong if it's not right.  And so we'll hold on a little longer to make sure we get treated fairly at the end of the day. We'll do what's right at the end. I'll tell you, Nancy, this a multiyear issue, and we'll probably face this and many others we haven't heard from yet as an industry for the next couple until the economy is assuredly on its feet and doing well again.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo, CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I think you've talked some about the interest rate environment but you could elaborate more? How much more negative impact could there be if rates stay at these unexpectedly low levels.","Andrew Cecere","Well, Mike, this is Andy. We're expecting them to stay at this level for the rest of the year certainly, and that is the environment for which we're projecting relatively stable net interest margin because again, the headwind of the reinvestment risk on the securities portfolio is essentially offset by the opportunity on the reestablishment of our debt at a lower cost. And those 2 things right now as far as we can see the rest of this year stabilize our margin to today's levels.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","But more generally, if over the next 3 years we have the rate curve the way it is today, are you half done with the pain or you expect a lot more pain for you or for the industry? Because one bank yesterday said, well, it's all done. It's all in the numbers and these low rates shouldn't hurt anymore. Whereas I thought you gave one presentation saying, oh no, it could actually hurt some.","Andrew Cecere","Yes. So Mike, for the rest of the year, again, it's stable. If this exact rate environment went into next year I think for us and for industry, it will be a little bit of a negative bias because the yield curve is relatively flat. Low rates are at the low, and the short end rates are as low as they're going to go. And we are, as you know, positively biased to an increase in rates. We're asset-sensitive, so we would benefit from an increase in rates or a steeper yield curve. I don\u2019t think it's material next year if it stays at the current level, but there's a negative bias.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And longer term, you go 2 or 3 years out?","Andrew Cecere","I would have the same answer.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","So not material, though?","Andrew Cecere","Continued negative bias but not hugely material.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then separately, as far as acquisitions, what's your appetite? One thing you can do on an environment with some revenue headwinds is cut more costs or buy other banks. Where do you stand on that?","Andrew Cecere","Well, we always look at opportunities that are presented. I will tell you that right now it's a fairly quiet environment in terms of M&A. There isn't a lot of activity going on from the traditional bank standpoint. What you've seen us in the past look at are small corporate trust transactions, payments transactions, that's both on a merchant acquiring side as well as the card issuing side, and those types of things are always in the works. None of them are huge and material, but those are the types of things we're focused on.","Richard K. Davis","And Mike, we have all the powder we need, both time, energy and capital, if we want to go after something. So it's not an issue of not wanting to. We just don't have anything that's out there we like. And we look at a lot of things and turn them down because the price points aren't very attractive. I think you'll see between now and the end of the year a number of payments and\/or corporate trust deals that won't register at headline level but they'll continue to be the calling together of opportunity that we think present itself for scale and\/or efficiency in markets and we're going to continue to deliver those to you all. But in terms, as Andy said, of traditional bank deals, they're simply not out there at the level we like and we're not reaching for them because we don't need them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David George, Baird.","David A. George - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Question on capital. You bought back looks like 13 million shares. You returned over 50% again of your earnings to shareholders on the quarter. I notice you released kind of your estimate of the new Basel guidelines at 7.9%, using that math. Does that make you think any differently about buybacks? Are you -- does that change your view on returning capital near term?","Andrew Cecere","Sure. This is Andy. We, as you know, the new rules came out in June 7. On June 7, as we worked through the new rules, we paused our buybacks for the remainder of the second quarter. The new rules resulted in about a 7% increase in our risk-weighted assets. We are bound by the standardized approach because our capital ratios would actually be better or higher under the advanced approaches. So we're bound by the standardized. We -- as you also -- as we also talked about, moved about $12 billion from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity in our securities portfolio because we intend to hold those securities and because it reduces the volatility. So given all that, our target capital ratio under the new calculation is approximately 8%. And as you mentioned, we're at 7.9%, so we expect to be there in the third quarter and expect to continue to go back to the buyback program in the third quarter.","Richard K. Davis","So let me -- this is Richard. Let me just make it easier. I'll do the math for you. Last quarter, we're at 8.4% Tier 1 under Basel III, and we've stated our goal of 8.15%. That 8.15% was 7 plus 0.5 for a buffer for domestic SIFI, which we have no guidance for, and 0.65 for just other buffers. Based on the actions that Andy just talked about, we think that the OCI volatility is lower. So we're bringing that 8.15% down to 8%, which is 0.5 and 0.5. And we're now at 7.9% under the new rules. So we went from 8.4% compared to 8.15%. Now we're at 7.9% compared to 8%. And based on your question and his answer, we'll accrete back to 8% very quickly in this quarter, and then we'll continue our way.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Paul Miller, FBR.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I want to go back to the again your average balance sheet on your NIM. And I think one of the first questions you talked about -- somebody asked a question about how much borrowings you got repricing. Are they short-term borrowings or long-term borrowings that are repricing?","Andrew Cecere","Yes, It's a combination of both, Paul, and it's about $6.5 billion that is going to mature. So it's not repricing. It's maturing third quarter that will be replaced by either other issued debt or deposits.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And then on your time deposits, you have $14 billion that same relatively consistent. My guess is most of that is a 1-year paper. Is that repricing also and what type of level are they repricing at?","Andrew Cecere","Yes. So I would say our deposit balances in total, including those time deposits that you're referring to, are repricing, but the differential on what's coming on versus what's coming off is not as dramatic as the debt side of the equation.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So you have CDs that you're repricing above 1%?","Andrew Cecere","We have either the differential between what's coming off and on is not nearly the same again as what the debt differential is. And that's why we focused on that because that debt differential is the big tailwind [indiscernible] on the securities. That's right.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then on the security portfolio, did you guys disclose, if you did, because I've been jumping all around today, what type of CPR rates you were seeing on those portfolios?","Andrew Cecere","We did not, and it hasn't changed dramatically. We have a little bit higher prepayments because of the rate environment, but it wasn't a dramatic change from where it has been the last few quarters.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And your duration. I think you said it's short-term. But have you disclosed what it is? I think it's -- is it around 3 years?","Andrew Cecere","It's under that number. What we're putting on, what the duration of -- what the average life of the book is stated in our Q. The duration is in that 2-year neighborhood.","Operator","And at this time there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to you for closing remarks.","Judith T. Murphy","Good, thank you, Holly, and thank you all for listening to our results. If you have any follow-up questions, as usual, feel free to call. And we will talk to you next quarter.

This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon Eastern Daylight time through Wednesday, April 25 at 12:00 midnight Eastern Daylight time.","I will now turn the conference call over to Jenn Thompson, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp. ","Jenn Thompson","Thank you, James, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Andy Cecere, Terry Dolan, and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s first quarter results and to answer your questions. Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.","I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today\u2019s presentation, in our press release, and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. ","I will now turn the call over to Andy.","Andy Cecere","Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry and I will open our call for questions. I\u2019ll start on Slide 3.","In the first quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.96, which compares with $0.82 reported in the first quarter of 2017. During the quarter, a lower than expected tax rate offset by a transitional change in vesting provisions within our stock-based compensation program increased earnings per share by one penny. On a year-over-year basis, first quarter net revenue increased by 3.4% to $5.5 billion. Excluding the impact of tax reform on our net interest income, revenue growth would have been 3.9%.","Loan growth is seasonally lowest in the first quarter of every year. Pay downs have been a headwind in recent quarters due to capital markets activities by customers and our disciplined underwriting in commercial real estate at this stage of the business cycle. In addition, in the first quarter loan demand has been lower across the industry. These factors offset solid growth in our retail loan portfolios and underlying strength in new business and market share gains in our commercial portfolios. We believe the early part of this year will prove to be a transition period. Tax reform impacted not only loan growth this quarter but also commercial products revenue as it influenced the timing and level of corporate bond issuance and deal funding. Combined with strong growth in pipelines, conversations with our customers gives us confidence that commercial loan trends will improve as we move further into the year, although the timing of more robust growth tied to a resurgence in capex investment remains uncertain. ","In the meantime, we are focused on gaining market share across our lending [indiscernible] products. This quarter, we saw improved sales volume growth in merchant processing, higher sales growth in credit card and commercial payment services, and strong growth in new customer accounts and client balances in our wealth management and investment services businesses. We expect this momentum to continue into the year.","On the right side of Slide 3, you will see that credit quality was stable in the first quarter and our book value per share increased by 5.9% from a year ago. During the quarter, we returned 68% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. ","Slide 4 highlights our best-in-class performance metrics, including a 14.9% return on average common equity, a 1.5% return on average assets, and our tangible return on common equity was 19.3%. Our efficiency ratio rose modestly from a year ago to 55.9%, reflecting increased investment in spending on technology and innovation and certain transitional matters related to stock-based compensation that Terry will address in a moment. As we discussed previously, we are stepping up our business investment in digital-first capabilities, revenue enhancing initiatives and business automation. We expect the 55.9% efficiency ratio to be the high for the year. ","Now let me turn the call over to Terry, who will provide more detail on the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance.","Terry Dolan","Thanks Andy. If you turn to Slide 5, I\u2019ll start with a balance sheet review and follow up with a discussion of earnings trends. ","In the first quarter, average loans grew 2.3% compared with the first quarter of 2017, a decline by 0.1% on a linked quarter basis. During the quarter, we reclassified $1.5 billion of student loans originated under the federal loan program to held for sale. As you know, we exited the student loan origination business in 2012 and the runoff portfolio is now strategically important to our future businesses. The reclassification did not materially affect our average balance sheet for the quarter; however, it did affect ending loan balance growth.","Turning to core trends, average loan growth is slowest in the first quarter for each year, reflecting seasonality affecting credit card, auto lending, and mortgage banking in particular. This quarter, mortgage loans increased 0.9% sequentially but were up 3.9% year-over-year. Similarly, retail loans declined 0.2% sequentially but increased 6.1% year-over-year. Retail and mortgage loan growth is seasonally stronger in the second quarter of each year and we feel good about core trends in auto lending and leasing, where we continue to gain market share, and credit card balances.","Adding to the impacts of seasonality on retail loan growth this quarter were a few factors. Commercial and commercial real estate portfolios continued to be impacted by elevated levels of pay downs. While average commercial loans increased 4.0% from a year ago, average balances declined 0.1% sequentially. Pipelines improved as the quarter developed and we continue to grow commitments, however, line utilization remains at historical lows and pay down activity was exacerbated this quarter by corporate clients flush with cash on the heels of tax reform and continuing to deleverage their balance sheets.","Turning to commercial real estate, average loans declined 6.5% year-over-year and 1.6% on a linked quarter basis. The risk-reward dynamics in commercial real estate remain unfavorable in our view, particularly in multi-family and certain areas of commercial mortgage lending. That discipline is influencing decisions to not extend credit on unfavorable terms and adding to the elevated pay down pressures driven by customers accessing the secondary market.","This quarter, commercial real estate contributed a 25 basis point drag to linked quarter average loan growth and a 160 basis point drag to year-over-year average loan growth. In the near term, we intend to remain disciplined in our commercial real estate lending.","Turning to Slide 6, average total deposits increased 1.9% year-over-year but declined 1.4% on a linked quarter basis. The linked quarter decline partly reflects typical first quarter seasonality that we see in corporate and commercial banking and wealth management and investment services. Within our corporate trust business, CLO issuances and deal closings tend to be seasonally lower in the first quarter, impacting balances. In addition, investment managers deployed funds for loan and other asset purchases, taking advantage of favorable debt market conditions in the early part of the first quarter.","Recently, our deal pipeline strengthened within the corporate trust business and ending deposits began to seasonally increase across the business lines. Slide 7 indicates that credit quality was relatively stable, net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans increased three basis points on a linked quarter basis, and were down one basis point compared with the first quarter of 2017. Non-performing assets were essentially flat compared with the fourth quarter and down 19.5% from the first quarter of 2017.","Slide 8 provides highlights of first quarter earnings results. Please note that during the first quarter, the company adopted accounting standards related to revenue recognition and certain revenue and expense categories have been recast to reflect the change in accounting standard. The adoption had no material impact on operating income, as you can see on Slide 9. ","Slide 9 also shows how tax reform impacted our first quarter net interest income and the related revenue growth rates. In the first quarter, net revenue of $5.5 billion was down 2.3% compared with the fourth quarter and up 3.4% versus the first quarter of 2017. Adjusting for the impact of tax reform on our taxable equivalent net interest income, revenue increased 3.9% on a year-over-year basis.","On Slide 10, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $3.2 billion in the first quarter, essentially flat compared with the fourth quarter and up 5.5% year-over-year, which was in line with our guidance. Linked quarter growth was impacted by two fewer days while year-over-year growth was supported by growth in loans and higher loan yields.","In the first quarter, the net interest margin was 3.13%. This is two basis points higher than the fourth quarter net interest margin of 3.11%. Both periods include the impact of the reclassifications related to the revenue recognition standards. Excluding the impact of tax reform on tax exempt earning assets, the net interest margin increased by four basis points on a linked quarter basis. The increase was driven by higher yields on earning assets due to higher rates and a steeper yield curve, partly offset by higher funding costs. ","Our interest bearing deposit betas continued to perform in line with past experience and our expectation after the December rate hike. We expect the total interest bearing deposit beta following the most recent rate hike will be about 40%. As future rate hikes occur, we continue to expect our deposit beta will gradually trend toward our 50% level.","Slide 11 highlights trends in non-interest income, which decreased by 4.1% on a linked quarter basis and increased 0.6% on a year-over-year basis. Linked quarter results are affected by seasonality within our credit and debit card, merchant processing, and mortgage banking businesses. On a year-over-year basis, we saw growth in credit and debit card revenue and corporate payments revenue due to higher sales volume. Merchant processing services revenue increased 2.5%, supported by strong volume growth. Merchant processing revenue continues to be impacted by exiting two joint ventures in the second quarter of 2017. We continue to expect that merchant acquiring revenue will return to a more normalized mid-single digit pace by the third quarter of 2018.","Trust and investment management fees increased 8.2% year-over-year, driven by business growth, net asset inflows and favorable market conditions. Strong growth in payments revenue, trust and investment management revenue, and deposit services fees was partially offset by an 11.1% decrease in mortgage banking revenue, which was affected by lower refinancing activity and lower gain on sale margins, and a 10.9% decrease in commercial product revenue. Treasury management fees declined 2%, reflecting the impact of changes in earnings credit, which is a trend typical in a rising rate environment. ","Client behavior related to tax reform was a headwind to our commercial products revenue this quarter. Meaningful deleveraging by clients flush with cash led to reduced corporate bond issuance and investment-grade underwriting activity. There was also a significant reduction in municipal market activity due to a pull forward of issuance into the fourth quarter of 2017 related to tax reform. Corporate bond market conditions have improved in the early weeks of the second quarter and announced M&A activity continues to pick up.","Turning to Slide 12, non-interest expense decreased 0.6% on a linked quarter basis, excluding notable items included in the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, expenses grew by 5.0%, in line with our expectation for the quarter. Personnel expenses were the biggest driver of costs while non-personnel expenses declined 1.2% from a year ago. Compensation expense increased 9.5% principally due to the impact of hiring to support business growth and compliance programs, merit increases, higher variable compensation related to business production, and the impact of changes in vesting provisions related to stock-based compensation programs. This vesting change was related to changes in our compensation programs in response to shareholder feedback and to ensure competitive programs within the employment and [indiscernible] market. The vesting change negatively impacted year-over-year expense growth by 130 basis points. Excluding this impact, total non-interest expense would have increased by 3.7% and compensation expense would have increased 6.9% from a year ago. ","Notably within non-personnel expenses, professional service expense declined 13.5% from a year ago, primarily due to fewer consulting services as compliance programs near maturity. As we discussed previously, we\u2019ll hit an inflection point in the growth rate of costs related to the build out of programs related to our consent order in the second half of 2018. Compliance related costs will continue to moderate through the year. ","We have started to deploy increased investment dollars towards digital capabilities and innovation projects, multi-cultural initiatives and brand. The impact of these investments will occur over the next several quarters and the magnitude will depend upon the timing of our investment opportunities. Including the impact of these business investments, we still expect full-year 2018 expense growth will be within the 3 to 5% range we think of as normalized. As a result of our investments, we expect stronger revenue growth, improved productivity, and expense efficiencies in the future. ","With respect to income taxes, our tax rate on a taxable equivalent basis declined from approximately 29% in 2017, excluding notable items, to a tax rate on a taxable equivalent basis of 18.9% in the first quarter of 2018. This tax rate was slightly lower than expected due to the accounting impact of stock-based compensation and the resolution of certain tax matters during the quarter. ","Slide 13 highlights our capital position. At March 31, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach was 9.0%. This compares to our capital target of 8.5%. ","I will now provide some forward-looking guidance. For the second quarter, we expect net interest income to increase in the mid-single digit range on a year-over-year basis. We expect fee revenue to increase in the low single digit range year-over-year. As a reminder, fees are seasonally higher in the second quarter. We expect expense growth to be in the mid-single digit range year-over-year, within our long-term growth target of 3 to 5%. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the full year 2018. We expect credit quality to remain relatively stable compared with the first quarter, and our full-year tax rate on a taxable equivalent basis is estimated to be about 21%.","I\u2019ll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.","Andy Cecere","Thanks Terry. The early part of 2018 is shaping up as we thought it would. The economy is on solid footing and consumer and business confidence is strong. While the business confidence has not translated into increased lending activity yet, we believe it will. Strong consumer spending supported by a strong job market, higher wages and lower taxes should drive more business activity and business investment in technology and infrastructure, and we are well positioned to win the lending business that comes with it. Business optimism is evident in the conversations our bankers are having with our clients and we are seeing that in terms of increased commitments and more robust pipelines. ","I feel very good about the outlook for our fee businesses. We are reaching an inflection point in merchant processing revenue and our focus on retail-driven purchase mortgages is enabling us to capture market share in mortgage banking. While reduced headwinds are a positive development, I am most excited about the sales and volume trends we are seeing in some of our higher return fee businesses like payments and trust and investment services, which provides fuel to an already good momentum heading into the second quarter and beyond.","As we have discussed previously, we are accelerating technology and innovation investments spent on initiatives aimed at enhancing the customer experience and leveraging our competitive positioning with a particular focus on payments, digital and mobile banking, and B2B capabilities. These investments will position us at the forefront in banking and drive improved operating leverage over the next several years.","In closing, I\u2019m confident that our business model combined with the hard work, dedication and integrity of our entire U.S. Bank team will enable us to deliver improving returns on equity for shareholders in the near term and over the longer term without compromising our risk profile.","That concludes our formal remarks. Terry, Bill and I will now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Your first question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, please, your line is open.","Ricky Dodds ","Hey guys, this is actually Ricky Dodds from Matt\u2019s team. Just a quick question on expenses. Appreciate the color you gave. Just wondering if you could talk about expense growth as we exit 2018. You\u2019ve had an uptick in costs this year and recent years, and I was wondering if we could see expense growth sort of at the lower end of your long-term range in 2019, or maybe even below that. Thanks.","Terry Dolan","Yes, this is Terry, and thanks for the question, Ricky. With respect to expenses, we certainly expect them to be in 2018 kind of in the higher end of that range, as we\u2019ve said. As we get into 2019, one of the things that we expect and we think is important is that we would start to see revenue accelerate because of some of the investments that we\u2019re making, as well as some of the efficiencies that we would expect from business automation and other activities that we are investing in. So I don\u2019t know whether it will come down to the lower end of that range in 2019, but I think we\u2019ll start to see an inflection point where it will start to come down in the range during 2019.","Ricky Dodds","Got it, thank you. Maybe a follow-up, sort of switching gears, just thoughts on mortgage banking for the year. It was a bit weaker than we had expected in the first quarter, and just wondering if there\u2019s any read-throughs there; and then just overall thoughts as we move throughout 2018.","Terry Dolan","Yes, so again let me take that question. On mortgage banking, I think we\u2019re kind of seeing a couple of different things. One is that we\u2019ve had a very strong focus on enhancing the retail channel and focusing on purchased mortgages over the last couple of years. What we are seeing in our particular business is we\u2019ve actually seen applications increase on a year-over-year basis by about 11% but the revenue coming down on a year-over-year basis, and that\u2019s principally because in the industry, it\u2019s very competitive in terms of the gain on sale margins that we are seeing and that the industry is seeing, particularly in the correspondent banking. ","I think that as the year progresses that margin compression is placing a lot of pressure on our competitors. We\u2019re continuing to capture market share and as capacity in the industry starts to go down, we should start to see improving margins, but the timing of that is hard to know. ","Andy Cecere","And Terry, I\u2019d add that our capabilities in the digital front, specifically our loan [indiscernible] positions us well for that gain on share in the retail side. ","Ricky Dodds","Thanks guys.","Andy Cecere","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore. Go ahead, please, your line is open","John Pancari","Good morning. ","Andy Cecere","Morning John.","John Pancari","To the deposit topic, on the non-interest bearing deposits, down about 6%, I know you mentioned that\u2019s seasonality, but the year-over-year balance is still down about 3.5% or so. Is there something else going on there? Is this more of the impact of higher rates and deposit betas picking up? Just want to get some color on that, thanks.","Terry Dolan","Yes John, this is Terry again. When we look at deposit trends, for us it\u2019s really kind of important to look at the business mix of our deposits. We typically in the first quarter see deposits being down on a seasonal basis, and that\u2019s because deal flow within corporate trust tends to be higher in the fourth quarter and then lower in the first quarter, so we always see kind of a run-off. If we look at the deposit outflows that we saw in the first quarter, we didn\u2019t see anything significant in the consumer or the retail side at all; in fact, they were pretty stable from fourth quarter to first quarter. The wholesale or our corporate and commercial banking deposits were down, but if you end up looking year-over-year, seasonally it\u2019s about the same. ","The most significant decrease that we saw was within our corporate trust business, and we really think that\u2019s tied to three factors. The first is the fact that a lot of CLO deals got pulled forward because of tax reform into the fourth quarter, so fourth quarter balances were higher, and in the first quarter the CLO investment managers started to deploy those deposit balances out of the trust, so that\u2019s pretty natural, but I think because of the pull forward it was more pronounced in the first quarter. ","Second is just timing of M&A activity. We have escrow balances and we saw an outflow of escrow balances, which is really tied to M&A deals. With the pipeline of M&A strengthening, we would expect that to get stronger. And then, just normal seasonality, so it\u2019s kind of three different factors that are happening in the corporate trust business, not as much really tied to deposit pricing.","Andy Cecere","Terry, I\u2019d add our deposit beta assumptions were consistent with our expectations, approaching 40. We still expect them to hit 50 towards the middle and last part of 2018. The other point I\u2019d make is that we saw acceleration in deposits actually here early in the second quarter. ","Terry Dolan","Yes, yes.","John Pancari","Got it, thank you. Separately on the loan front, in terms of your expectation around the trajectory of loan growth, are you still comfortable with a GDP-plus of loan growth as you look at 2018, or could it be weaker just given the trends we saw this quarter? Thanks.","Andy Cecere","Well, it does appear to be a little stronger in the second quarter than the first quarter, but we still think it\u2019s probably going to pick up mostly in the second half of the year. We did see in the C&I side, for example, our ending balances were higher at the end of the quarter, so there are signals that it\u2019s starting to pick up.","John Pancari","Okay, so you\u2019ll still go with the GDP-plus range for the full year?","Terry Dolan","Yes, I mean, that\u2019s something we talked about last--you know, we\u2019ll see loan growth, for example, in many of our retail categories, and that\u2019s going to be more tied to what GDP is doing, etc. I think we see a number of signs that would still make us feel comfortable at this point.","John Pancari","Okay, thank you.","Andy Cecere","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald from Bernstein. Go ahead, please, your line is open.","John McDonald","Hi guys. I wanted to follow up a little bit on the expenses. Just maybe bigger picture, Andy, the 3 to 5% normalized expense growth, you mentioned that a few times, and it\u2019s something you targeted at the investor day in 2016. Just remind us, what are the foundational assumptions of why 3 to 5 is what you target over time, and the reason I\u2019m asking is we get the question, other regional banks seem able this year and maybe next year to self-fund their tech investments and keep investments pretty flattish this year and next. What\u2019s different about U.S. Bank in terms of maybe where you are in the cycle that you\u2019re at 3 to 5 and in an elevated year you\u2019re at 5, when others are doing flattish?","Andy Cecere","Well John, I\u2019ll start with the fact that we\u2019re starting from an efficiency ratio a bit lower than those other banks that you\u2019re describing. I do think we\u2019re going to, and we are going to focus on positive operating leverage and making sure that our expense growth is below our revenue growth, but at the same time we want to make sure we\u2019re balanced in terms of making investments for the longer term. If we\u2019re factoring all those things into our number of 3 to 5%, I do think it will range in there for sure. I do think that there are periods it will be at the low end of the range, but we want to make sure we\u2019re thinking about things not only in the short term but in the long term.","Terry Dolan","John, the other thing that I would just add to that is it\u2019s important to remember our business mix relative to a lot of our regional banks that we end up competing against. With the payments business and the investment management business in particular, in the payments business a lot of those expenses are more variable in nature and so as revenue grows, expenses will grow with that, not to the same level, but--so the business mix ends up impacting that a little bit.","John McDonald","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Just as a reminder, what do you guys think is an appropriate medium term efficiency target for you guys, say over the next one, two, three years?","Andy Cecere","Well, as I said in the prepared remarks, John, I do expect that this first quarter is the high point for the year, and we continue to expect it will be in the mid to low 50s in terms of our efficiency ratio, so I expect it to migrate down principally because we\u2019re going to have positive operating leverage.","John McDonald","Okay, great. Then just a reminder, Terry, where you stand on interest rate sensitivity. Has anything changed there, and can you remind us of the split between the long and short end sensitivity?","Terry Dolan","Yes. If you end up looking at our balance sheet, probably about 50% of our assets benefit from the short end of the curve in terms of movements in interest rates, and about 50% of it benefits more on the long end of the curve. That\u2019s really what our business mix has been overall.","From an asset liability sensitivity perspective, one of the things I would kind of maybe point out, and Andy talked a little bit about our deposit betas, but if you think about our corporate trust business, we\u2019re getting closer to what I would call that terminal beta level, and that\u2019s kind of starting to being baked into our rate movements, as well as on the wholesale side. The movement up of deposit betas for us, I think will be impacted by, and I think relative to maybe some of our competitors, so that\u2019s the way we think about it.","Andy Cecere","Because for about half of our balances, it\u2019s already at the highest level.","Terry Dolan","Yes.","John McDonald","Great, and then just one follow-up. You mentioned the overall retail beta, or the beta assumptions getting to, I think you said 40 later in the year. Could you just talk about the retail beta and is that the terminal assumption there, or would you expect to go higher than the terminal on the retail over time since it\u2019s been so low for the first part of the cycle?","Terry Dolan","Yes, so the movement from 40 to 50 is probably going to be more so an assumption that retail deposits are going to start to move upward in terms of deposit betas. Through the most recent rate cycle or rate hike, we have seen very, very little movement in terms of deposit pricing. I do think that with the March rate hike and as we get into the rest of the year, we are going to see more competition with respect to retail deposits and we\u2019re just going to be pricing to meet that competition. ","John McDonald","Okay, thanks guys.","Andy Cecere","Thanks John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please, your line is open.","Betsy Graseck","Thanks, good morning. A couple questions. One, just to continue the last conversation, your loan to deposit ratio appears to be pretty low - I think it\u2019s in the low 80s. I wonder if that\u2019s something you can use strategically to hold back on deposit beta at all.","Terry Dolan","Yes, I think the way that I would think about it, Betsy, I do think that there is that opportunity. I think we can be a little bit more targeted and more focused with respect to how we think about retail deposits. We price in 120 different markets and so we surgically look at where the competition is moving rates, and then we only really have to move in those particular markets. I think your point is correct in the sense that we can be more targeted and we can be a little bit more focused with respect to deposit betas as they end up changing. I think that again we haven\u2019t seen a lot of movement yet, but that\u2019s something that we\u2019re expecting. ","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Then separately on capital return, dividend payout ratios, that kind of conversation, obviously the Fed put out the SCB proposal recently. Maybe you could talk a little bit about how you see that proposal impacting you and your minimum capital ratios that you have been targeting, because obviously your SCB is well below the ratios that the Fed has been putting out there. The SCB of 2.5%, you\u2019re well below that, I believe, so maybe you could talk a little bit about that as well as how you think about the dividend payout ratio over the next couple years here, given that the soft cap is likely to be removed.","Andy Cecere","Betsy, this is Andy. We continue to be bound by the base case, not the stress case. Our base case target is 8.5% common equity Tier 1; we\u2019re at 9%, so we\u2019re in the range. Our capital distribution has been in the range of our long-term targets of that 30 to 40. I do think the one change that this may offer an opportunity to do is to increase the dividend component of that share versus the buyback, so you might--you will see us increasing the dividend piece as this rule becomes more clear.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Any expectation for how much that could move over time? I\u2019m not asking for the specific CCAR because I know you can\u2019t talk about that, but you\u2019ve been in the low 30s but then if I look pre-crisis, 10 years ago, you did run with a much higher dividend payout ratio, so just wondering how you think about what kind of over time payout ratio your business can handle, given the low earnings volatility that you typically have.","Andy Cecere","Sure. So Betsy, as we think about the 30 to 40 on dividends and 30 to 40 on buybacks, I could see our dividend component migrating towards that 40.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. All right, thanks so much.","Andy Cecere","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Go ahead, please, your line is open.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning. My first question is a follow-up to what John was asking, and appreciate, Andy, that you\u2019re reminding us of the medium term efficiency target of mid to low 50s. As we think about 2019, I\u2019m wondering if you could give us sort of a sense of timing of the investment spend relative to the revenue that you would reap from that investment spend, and I guess really the question I\u2019m asking is as we think about the efficiency ratio migrating over time lower, what that rate of change is going to look like in the initial year beyond 2018.","Andy Cecere","Erika, I think we\u2019re making these investments that we talked about with a particular focus on customer experience and digital, B2B, all those things I\u2019ve talked about. Those expenses are now starting to be baked into the run rate that you\u2019re seeing in the first quarter and you\u2019ll continue to see for the rest of the year. We\u2019re going to work on the expense growth to be in that 3 to 5% range under the assumption that our revenue growth is above that, and we\u2019ve talked about our revenue growth assumptions, so to the extent the revenue growth is robust, I would expect--and as expected, I would expect our expense to be 3 to 5%. If the revenue growth is below that, we\u2019ll manage expenses down consistent with what our revenue opportunities are, again with the objective of continuing to deliver positive operating leverage and a lower efficiency ratio over time.","Erika Najarian","Okay. I just wanted to ask a little bit about the commercial real estate dynamics. You\u2019re typically the bellwether in terms of credit inflection trends, and I\u2019m wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on some of the unfavorable terms that you\u2019re seeing as some of these loans come up for refinancing. I think the worry that the industry or the market has is that a lot of commercial real estate loans had been struck at ultra-low rates, and I\u2019m wondering whether or not part of your decision to not refinance is that the developers have other options for continued low rates outside of the banking industry and outside of U.S. Bank, and you\u2019re refusing to underwrite it under market rate.","Bill Parker","This is Bill. That\u2019s certainly part of it. It\u2019s either rate, and it\u2019s often tenure and just the lack of recourse structure on these long-tenured deals, whether it\u2019s insurance companies or the securities markets are offering, so that\u2019s where we\u2019ve seen the runoff in what we call the standing loan side, or mortgage loan side. On the construction side, we\u2019re still very, very active - we actually did see our ending construction loans up a little bit in the first quarter, so that was encouraging. That\u2019s where we focus, that\u2019s where we can add the most value.","Erika Najarian","Got it, thank you.","Andy Cecere","Thanks Erika.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Go ahead, please, your line is open.","Ken Usdin","Thanks, good morning everyone. Can I follow up on the payments and the restatement for the revenue and expense recognition? It would seem that you\u2019re taking out that rewards payment that was in short term borrowings and also putting that back in, and that\u2019s what changed out of the NII side. Is that right to say?","Terry Dolan","That\u2019s correct.","Ken Usdin","So then as a go-forward then, Terry, can you help us understand that now that that\u2019s going to be netted inside the payments lines, how does that change either the seasonality and the variability of payments revenues as we look ahead from this restated basis?","Terry Dolan","In terms of the seasonality, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to end up impacting it a lot. I mean, the rebates that you\u2019re talking about are principally related to our corporate payments businesses, and when you end up looking at the seasonality of that and then just how those rebates will match up against it, I think the seasonality will be the same, you just have to kind of reset your first quarter expectations regarding the line item.","Ken Usdin","Okay. More broadly on payments, I know you\u2019ve talked about the merchant processing getting back to mid single by midyear, and on a restated basis it looks like it was back to comping positive. Corporate debit is already doing 8, and corporate--credit and debit is up 8, and then corporate\u2019s up 12. Can those also continue to post improving rates of growth as we also move into the second half of the year? How coincidental is this overall rise in the payments business? Can you get back to those historical growth rates overall and in aggregate for each of them?","Bill Parker","I\u2019m going to hit corporate payments and Terry will talk about retail payments. On the corporate payments side, they\u2019re having an exceptional--they had an exceptional year last year and continue to see that in the first quarter. We had sales growth of 12%, revenue growth of 10%, and you\u2019re seeing really strong growth in both the government as well as the corporate sector. A lot of that is driven by some of the technology investments we\u2019ve talked about, one of which is virtual pay, which is up about 20% on a year-over-year basis, so I would continue to see strong growth in those categories in corporate payments at the very high end of that single-digit or low double-digit range.","Terry Dolan","Then when you think about retail credit card, we\u2019ve been talking about mid-single digit revenue growth for the year. That business tends to be a little bit seasonal in the sense that the fourth and first quarters tend to be a little bit higher in terms of the revenue growth, so I think it\u2019s important to keep that in mind. To the extent that we--I mean, we have been seeing strengthening with respect to consumer spend in that particular space, and I think that based upon everything that we\u2019re seeing, we believe that that can continue but it will be really tied to what does that retail customer spend look like over the course of the year.","Ken Usdin","Okay, thanks guys.","Andy Cecere","Thanks Ken.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Go ahead, please, your line is open.","Mike Mayo","Hi, can you hear me?","Andy Cecere","Yes Mike, we can hear you.","Mike Mayo","Okay. Is this new information or are you reiterating the old information about accelerating investing in tech and innovation? I thought, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, your tech budget is $1 billion each year and it\u2019s gone up to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, so when you\u2019re saying you\u2019re accelerating investing there, is this a little more of a step change than you were thinking before, and if so, why?","Andy Cecere","No Mike, it\u2019s not new information. It\u2019s reiteration of what we talked about in the fourth quarter.","Mike Mayo","Okay. If we could just get a little bit more meat on the bones, in terms of the areas where you\u2019re investing, if you could just give us a little more granularity, and what are the outcomes that you expect? You clearly said you want revenues to grow fast and expenses over time, that you\u2019re playing the long game. In terms of mobile and online users or other metrics like that, some banks disclose that, others don\u2019t. What should we look for on the outside to monitor your progress?","Andy Cecere","Thanks Mike. Let me break into the three categories. I\u2019ll start with the payments categories, and in there it\u2019s going to be a focus on increasing our capabilities around ecommerce and integrated software providers. We are good there and want to be even better in those categories, because that\u2019s where the growth is. On the retail side of the equation is increasing our digital capabilities. Today about 65 to 70% of transactions occur on our mobile device but under 20% of sales. We want to continue to enhance our capabilities around the sales side of the equation, offering convenience and speed for customers as we think about a digital-first world. Then on the business side of the equation, it\u2019s all focused on B2B and the new rails that are being built and our capabilities around those rails, so those are the three areas of focus. The outcome of those would be increased sales activity and customer acquisition on all three fronts, and particularly on the consumer front a more central relationship with those consumers and their ability to expand beyond our footprint with consumer customers.","Terry Dolan","Mike, I might add maybe just a couple of things. Obviously on the retail side, the areas of focus, we started in mortgage because we have an important business there in terms of our loan portal. Bringing online capabilities for people to be able to acquire autos online and be able to get the lending within essentially minutes associated with that, and then checking deposits and those sorts of things. A lot of the digital capabilities in the industry today are very service oriented, though, and so a significant focus for us is really more on the sales side as we go forward.","Andy Cecere","Right.","Mike Mayo","All right, that\u2019s helpful. So just big picture, are you doing this because you have the money with the tax reduction to catch up or to get ahead of the industry? How do you think about it?","Andy Cecere","Mike, I\u2019m doing this because I think this is where the industry is headed and I want to be at the forefront.","Mike Mayo","Got it. All right, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran from Autonomous Research. Go ahead, please, your line is open.","Brian Foran","Hi, most of my questions have been asked, but maybe just two quick ones, first on the guidance. All the year-over-year comparisons you\u2019re referencing are based on the newly reported numbers, not what was in the 2Q release, right?","Terry Dolan","That\u2019s right, based upon all the recasted numbers.","Brian Foran","Then in the NPL schedules, there was a little bit of a jump in C&I. I appreciate it was wholly offset by improvement elsewhere, but just any color on what drove that and broader C&I credit views.","Andy Cecere","Well, the credit is very stable, but yes, we did have one commercial account, it\u2019s a consumer products account, that did go non-performing, so it was just an isolated incident. But overall, credit metrics are very, very stable.","Brian Foran","Perfect, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja from JP Morgan. Go ahead, please, your line is open.","Vivek Juneja","Hi, thanks. A couple of quick questions. Number one, merchant processing, in the past you\u2019ve highlighted when the dollar was strengthening that you had an impact, a negative impact from FX translation. Given that the dollar has been weakening, can you give us some color on how much of a benefit you got from FX translation now?","Terry Dolan","Yes, so if you end up looking at revenue in merchant acquiring on a year-over-year basis, it\u2019s up about 2.5%, and what we have been guiding for the first half of the year is really that merchant acquiring on a core basis would be relatively flat on a year-over-year basis. That\u2019s essentially what the difference is between the two, is the FX. ","Saying that, again when we end up looking at the second half of the year and we think about the core growth within that business, we think about that in terms of the mid single digits, so we do expect it to continue to strengthen and the things that we end up looking at in particular is new business activity and sales volumes, and sales volumes continue to strengthen in that business as well.","Vivek Juneja","Great. Second one, the deposit betas on the whole wealth management side, where are those running now? What level is that, is it 70%? Any color on that, because obviously that\u2019s a different business.","Terry Dolan","Yes, so within our wealth management business, we started increasing deposit betas in the last rate cycle, and where there was literally no movement in earlier rate hikes, we started to see betas in the 10 to 15%, but they\u2019re well below what you see on the wholesale side or the other institutional side. That\u2019s kind of what we\u2019ve been experiencing.","Vivek Juneja","When you say institutional, you\u2019re talking--when I was referring to wealth management, I was referring to the whole side of wealth and the corporate trust, so--","Terry Dolan","Ah, okay.","Vivek Juneja","Yes, sorry. I realize different definitions, language.","Terry Dolan","Yes. So if you end up looking at corporate trust, when we get to more of a terminal sort of deposit beta in that 70 to 75% range, and we\u2019re pretty much there already, that\u2019s why as we think about the future, we believe from our asset liability sensitivity standpoint, that\u2019s pretty much baked in. That\u2019s kind of on the corporate trust side of the equation. Then what I would say on the core wealth management side is it\u2019s closer to that 15%.","Vivek Juneja","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez from UBS. Go ahead, please, your line is open.","Saul Martinez","Hi, good morning guys. I think in the last quarter, you highlighted that you expected to be sort of at the high end of the 3 to 5% expense guidance because of the reinvestment of a portion of the profit windfall. Sorry if I missed it, but is that still the expectation for 2018, or is it more revenue dependent?","Terry Dolan","No, that is still our expectation.","Saul Martinez","Okay, thanks. I guess a little bit more of a detail question, the other non-interest income line, you mentioned this quarter was off because of lower equity investment. Could you help size that up? I know it\u2019s a difficult line item to gauge on a quarter to quarter basis, but this quarter it was light relative to last year, even on a restated basis. Can you just give us a sense or help us understand what a more normalized level should be going forward?","Terry Dolan","Yes, so in terms of giving the specifics regarding equity investments, we\u2019ve never really provided that specific type of guidance. I will say in other revenue, there is many different categories of types of revenues that are part of that, including for example end of term gains and losses on residuals, etc. It tends to be lumpy because of not only equity investments but just the way that all those different categories end up interacting from one quarter to the next, so I think what I would suggest is kind of look over a period of time and you can see a range, and I would just look within that range as kind of a way of getting some sense on other income.","Saul Martinez","Got it. It\u2019s just the number is about $30 million lower this quarter than the average of last year, so just wanted to make sure I understood that a little bit better.","Terry Dolan","Yes, it tends to be lumpy.","Saul Martinez","Got it. Just a final one, quick one on the consent order. Any update there in terms of how that\u2019s progressing, and just anything you can share on that?","Terry Dolan","Nothing different. We are in our sustainability phase, things are going as expected. We expect to be done with our part of the equation midyear, June 30, and then the regulators will continue what they\u2019re doing, and that timing is uncertain. But we are right on track with what we expect.","Saul Martinez","Great, thanks a lot. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker from Piper Jaffray. Go ahead, please, your line is open.","Kevin Barker","Thanks. Just a follow-up on the deposit beta. Can you give us an idea of where your deposit beta on wholesale side stood this quarter and where it was the previous quarter, and where you expect that terminal rate to be?","Terry Dolan","Yes, on the wholesale side, the betas are kind of in that 55 to 65% range, and that\u2019s getting pretty close to the terminal level that we have experienced in the past. That\u2019s where it is today, Kevin.","Kevin Barker","So overall, your wealth management combined with the wholesale are getting pretty close to the terminal side--","Terry Dolan","Yes.","Kevin Barker","--and then it\u2019s just basically catch-up on the retail? ","Terry Dolan","That\u2019s exactly right.","Kevin Barker","Okay. Then a follow-up on some of the mortgage questions. You mentioned the correspondent has seen heavy competition. Could you give us an idea of where your gain on sale margins dropped on a correspondent basis from 4Q to 1Q, and what your expectations are at least for the next couple of quarters?","Terry Dolan","Yes, if you end up looking at margins on the correspondent side, they\u2019re in the high single to low double-digit range, and that\u2019s probably 20 to 30 basis points lower than what we would normally see. Our expectation is that as we get into the latter half of the year and probably more so into the fourth quarter that they will start to rebound, because there\u2019s a lot of pressure on the smaller players and the players that just don\u2019t have the capacity to be able to deal with margins that low. But that\u2019s kind of where they\u2019re at, and our expectation is it will start to improve, it\u2019s just a matter of timing.","Kevin Barker","Okay, all right. Thank you for taking my questions.","Andy Cecere","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead, please, your line is open.","Gerard Cassidy ","Thank you. Good morning, Andy, good morning, Terry. ","Terry Dolan","Hey Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","On the terminal betas that you guys have been talking about on the call, it sounds like the terminal level, and please correct me if I\u2019m wrong, is around the 65% range. Is that fair, or is it a little lower, a little higher?","Terry Dolan","Well, it would be--on the wholesale side, it\u2019s probably just a bit lower, but kind of in that ballpark. On the corporate trust side, it tends to be a little bit higher because we end up having--the substitute investment is government funds, for example in the money market fund area or T-bills, so you have to kind of track to that, but that tends to be closer to the 70 to 75%.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay, thank you. Could we ever see them get to 100%? I mean, in your experience, because obviously we\u2019re in a rate environment we have not seen before, being so low, could these terminal betas ever get to 100%?","Terry Dolan","Yes, that certainly isn\u2019t our expectation based upon both our experience in the business and also from a client standpoint. There are certain operating needs in cash flow, so there\u2019s a benefit to having those deposits with the bank, so I don\u2019t think from the perspective of having to be competitive in terms of what they\u2019re accomplishing that we have to go that high. I think we\u2019re at or very close to what where we need to be.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. I apologize, Terry, if you addressed this - in prior calls you had talked about the impact that the hurricanes and natural disasters had on your merchant processing and acquiring businesses. I think you pointed out in the spring of this year, you thought that would get back to normal. If you haven\u2019t addressed it, where are we on that timeline?","Terry Dolan","Yes, good follow-up. In terms of the impact of Irma and Harvey, that has pretty much dissipated, so certainly early in the first quarter any effect associated with that has pretty much worked its way in. Puerto Rico is much smaller for us, it really isn\u2019t that significant, but it will take more time for that to recover.","Gerard Cassidy","Great, than just lastly, you guys have addressed the commercial real estate lending, how you guys obviously have conservative underwriting standards. What are you seeing in the other areas, whether it\u2019s retail or commercial? Is there any evidence of those underwriting standards getting a little too aggressive from your competitors that makes you wonder what they\u2019re doing? ","Bill Parker","This is Bill. I would say not necessarily. I mean, we\u2019re obviously in late stages of economic expansion and credit cycle. We just try to keep our underwriting consistent throughout the period. There have been--I mean, I\u2019ve talked about the real estate and a lot of activity in that long-term fixed rate pricing, which has affected our mortgage book; but on the other side, it\u2019s pretty much steady as she goes. There\u2019s a lot of pricing pressure, but basically we compete to have a full relationship and bring the other commercial products to the table.","Gerard Cassidy","Great, thank you so much.","Andy Cecere","Thanks Gerard.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, please, your line is open.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Thanks for the follow-up. I jumped on a little bit late here, but it sounds like you\u2019re not committing to lower expense growth next year, which I guess is a little surprising given the increase in investment spend this year. But it also sounds like you expect a nice increase in revenues, so I was hoping you could kind of frame it in terms of operating leverage percent that you\u2019re targeting if things go according to plan. I appreciate it\u2019s a year out, but I think we\u2019re all focused on the expense growth continuing to be quite high, and without having the context of the revenue expectations, it\u2019s a little--not totally clear.","Andy Cecere","Sure Matt. This is Andy, let me clarify a little bit. So we talked about 3 to 5% this year. At the high end of the range, because there\u2019s some of that increased investment we talked about, that increased investment will be in the run rate. We expect positive operating leverage this year, and going into next year I would continue to expect that. We\u2019re not going to increase our tech spend again next year, so that will be baked into the run rate, and I would expect that growth rates next year will start to migrate down within that 3 to 5% range.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, and in terms of the amount of positive operating leverage that you\u2019re targeting, because it\u2019ll likely be modest this year, I think, based on the guidance, and how much are you hopeful to achieve next year?","Andy Cecere","It will be modest this year and it will continue to increase as we go into 2019 and beyond, because our expectation is these investments will produce the revenue that we\u2019re looking for, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing it.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. I know a couple years ago, you put out some of these medium term revenue growth targets, and I think the hope was that you would achieve that in Year 3, which I think is next year. Is that something that\u2019s still possible, and remind us how much that revenue growth was?","Andy Cecere","Our revenue growth rates and our expense growth rates, we do expect to be in the ranges. We were in the 6 to 8% range on revenue, 3 to 5% on expense, and our return numbers were already in that range. One thing I will mention, Matt, is that we intend to increase our ranges on our returns given the new tax situation that we\u2019re in, and we\u2019ll communicate more about that. But as you saw, we\u2019re up in that range already, in the middle of the range.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, so just to summarize, you are hopeful of the 6 to 8% revenue growth next year, 3 to 5% expense growth, but hopefully drifting below the high end of that 3 to 5% range?","Andy Cecere","That\u2019s our target.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. All right, thank you for clarifying.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Klock from Keith Bruyette Woods. Go ahead, please, your line is open.","Brian Klock","Good morning, everyone. ","Andy Cecere","Morning.","Terry Dolan","Hey Brian.","Brian Klock","I just wanted to follow up a little bit on that commercial loan growth from earlier in the call, and I thought it was interesting looking at your segment data. I know you guys mentioned that there\u2019s still some corporate deleveraging, and a lot of your peers have talked about the same issue of some large pay downs on the corporate side. When we look at your corporate and commercial banking segment, though, I know this is averages versus end of period, so maybe there\u2019s a difference on end of period, but the corporate banking and other actually--you know, balances were slightly up on average, or up almost 3.6% year-over-year, but the middle market was actually down, and it seemed like the trend--that\u2019s a little bit different than at some of your peers. I wasn\u2019t sure if this is just an average issue or if your end of period balances in March were showing a different trend versus the average. Maybe you can just talk about that - it\u2019s Page 10 of your supplement.","Terry Dolan","Yes. Well, when I think about ending balances, on a spot basis, Brian, they are a little bit higher than the averages, so we do expect to see some momentum as we think about the second quarter. If you end up thinking about middle market, for us middle market, we\u2019re continuing to grow on the commitment side, but one of the things that we have seen a little bit is just the impact of pay downs or pay-offs, and the principal driver behind that is from market to market, we see some M&A activity and that M&A activity ends up negatively impacting some of the middle market. If you\u2019re looking across all of our markets, we\u2019re seeing nice growth in at least half of them, a little bit stronger than that, and we\u2019re seeing flat growth in the others, so it kind of depends market to market and it changes from quarter to quarter, too.","Brian Klock","Got it, thank you for that, Terry. So I guess my other follow-up is just on the funding side. Everyone has been focused on the betas, and you talked about on the wholesale deposit side the larger trust deposits getting closer to your terminal expectations. On the borrowing side, on your wholesale funding side the borrowing piece of this, Terry, can you remind us how much of that is swapped out to three-month LIBOR, and what are your expectations on the borrowing side with either refinancing or work at the borrowing cost [indiscernible]?","Terry Dolan","Yes, I know there\u2019s been a lot of conversation around the LIBOR basis risk, etc. on some of the other calls. For us, at the end of the first quarter as an example, we have very little that is floating rate on three-month LIBOR, so we don\u2019t have the same sort of basis risk to increase three-month LIBOR at this point.","Brian Klock","Okay, so is there anything swapped out for that, or you\u2019re saying just overall it\u2019s more fixed on that borrowing base?","Terry Dolan","Yes, well typically when we go into the marketplace in kind of a normal cycle, we have gone about 75% fixed, 25% LIBOR or floating, and tied to the three-month, but we have substantially swapped that out to fixed at this point.","Brian Klock","Got it, great. Thanks for your time.","Andy Cecere","Thanks Brian.","Operator","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Jenn Thompson for closing remarks.","Jenn Thompson","Thank you for listening to our call this quarter.

[Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon, Eastern Daylight Time through Tuesday, April 23 at 12 midnight Eastern Daylight Time.","I will now turn the conference call over to Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.","Judith T. Murphy","Thank you, Brooke, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's first quarter 2013 results and to answer your questions. Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules, are available on our website at usbank.com.","I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Richard.","Richard K. Davis","Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review U.S. Bank's first quarter results. I'd like to begin with a few quarterly highlights on Page 3 of the presentation. U.S. Bank reported net income of $1.4 billion for the first quarter of 2013 or $0.73 per diluted common share. Although a total net revenue of $4.9 billion was slightly lower than the same quarter of last year and the previous quarter due to a reduction in total expense, we achieved positive operating leverage year-over-year and linked quarter. Total average loans grew year-over-year by 5.8% and as expected, 1% or 4% annualized linked quarter. We experienced strong growth in total average deposits of 7.3% over the prior year and 0.5% over the fourth quarter of 2012. Credit quality remained strong.","Total net charge-offs decreased by $35 million or 7.5% from the prior quarter, while nonperforming assets declined at 9.9% linked quarter or 2.8% excluding covered assets. We generated significant capital this quarter. Our estimated Tier 1 common ratio under the most recent Basel III rules was 8.2% at March 31, with a Basel I Tier 1 common equity ratio of 9.1% and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 11%. We repurchased 17 million shares of common stock during the first quarter, which, along with our dividend, resulted in a 69% return of earnings to our shareholders in the first quarter.","Slide 4 provides you with the trends in our industry-leading performance metrics. Return on average assets in the first quarter was 1.65%, and return on average common equity was 16%. Our net interest margin and efficiency ratio are shown on the graph on the right-hand side of Slide 4. This quarter's net interest margin of 3.48% was, as expected, 7 basis points lower than the prior quarter's rate of 3.55%. Andy will discuss the margin in more detail in a few minutes.","Our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 50.7%, better than the prior year and the previous quarter. We continue to manage our operating expenses effectively and in line with revenue trends. We expect that this ratio will remain in the low-50s going forward, as we continue to manage expenses in relation to revenue trends while continuing to invest in and grow our businesses.","Turning to Slide 5. The company reported total net revenue in the first quarter of $4.9 billion, a 1.1% decrease from the prior year and a 4.7% decrease from the previous quarter. The decline in revenue year-over-year was largely driven by Mortgage Banking, while the linked quarter variance reflected both a reduction in Mortgage Banking, as well as normal first quarter seasonality within our business lines.","Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 6. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $12 billion or 5.8% year-over-year and 1% linked quarter. Overall, excluding covered loans, our run-off [ph]  portfolio, average total loans grew by 8% year-over-year and 1.4% linked quarter. Once again, the increase in average loans outstanding was led by strong growth in average commercial loans, which grew by 16.8% year-over-year and 2.3% over the prior quarter. Total average Commercial Real Estate also increased over the prior quarters. Residential real estate loans continue to show strong growth, 19.2% over the same quarter of last year and 4.5% over the prior quarter.","Within the retail loan categories, average credit card loan outstanding fell slightly as consumers paid down their balances, and average home equity lines and loans continue to decline as paydowns more than offset new loan originations. Auto loans and leases, however, posted good growth year-over-year.","We continue to originate and renew loans and lines for our customers. New originations, excluding mortgage production, plus new and renewed commitments, totaled over $35 billion in the first quarter. Total average revolving corporate and commercial commitments increased year-over-year by 11.9% and 1.7% on a linked quarter basis, while utilization remained stable at approximately 25%, basically where it's been for the past 5 quarters. Total average deposits increased by $16.7 billion or 17.3% over the same quarter of last year, and by $1.2 billion on a linked quarter basis, with growth in low-cost savings deposits particularly strong on a linked quarter basis.","Turning to Slide 7 and credit quality. Total net charge-offs in the first quarter decreased by $35 million or 7.5% from the fourth quarter of 2012, while nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, decreased by $59 million or 2.8%. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding in the first quarter declined to 0.79% from 0.85% in the fourth quarter. During the first quarter, we released $30 million of reserves compared with $25 million in the fourth quarter and $90 million in the first quarter of 2012. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we expect net charge-offs to remain relatively stable in the second quarter, while nonperforming assets will continue to trend lower.","Andy will now give you a few more details about our first quarter results.","Andrew Cecere","Thanks, Richard. Slide 8 gives you a view of our first quarter 2013 results versus comparable time periods. Our diluted EPS of $0.73 was 9% higher than the first quarter of 2012 and 1.4% higher than the prior quarter. For comparison purposes, recall that the fourth quarter 2012 results included an $80 million foreclosure-related settlement expense accrual that reduced EPS by $0.03.","The key drivers of the company's first quarter earnings are summarized on Slide 9. The $90 million or 6.7% increase in net income year-over-year was the result of a decrease in expense and a lower provision for credit losses, slightly offset by a reduction in net revenue. Net interest income increased year-over-year by $19 million or 0.7%. The favorable variance was largely driven by a $13.9 billion increase in average earning assets, mostly offset by a decrease in net interest margin. The 4.6% growth in average earning assets included increases in average total loans and loans held for sale, as well as planned increases in the securities portfolio.","The net interest margin of 3.48% was 12 basis points lower than the same quarter of last year, primarily due to lower-yielding investment securities and lower loan rates, partially offset by lower rates on deposits and wholesale funding and a reduction in cash balances held at the Fed. Noninterest income declined by 3.3% year-over-year, primarily due to Mortgage Banking revenue, reflecting lower origination and sales revenue, partially offset by higher servicing revenue and favorable change in the addition to the mortgage reps and warranty repurchase reserve. Also contributing to the decline in noninterest income year-over-year were lower equity investment gains, retail products revenue, primarily due to fewer cars coming off lease, and commercial products revenue. Offsetting these declines were increases in trust and investment management fees, retail payments and merchant processing revenue.","Noninterest expense was lower year-over-year by $90 million or 3.5%. The majority of this favorable variance is attributable to favorable variances in regulatory, insurance and litigation items, partially offset by higher compensation and benefits expense and an increase in tax credit investment costs, net occupancy and technology expense. Net income was higher on a linked quarter basis by $8 million or 0.6% as a result of an 8% decline in expense and a lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by a 4.7% decrease in net revenue. On a linked quarter basis, net interest income was lower as growth in average earning assets of $1.8 billion was offset by a 7-basis-point decline in net interest margin and the impact of 2 fewer days.","The 7-basis-point decline in net interest margin was primarily due to lower loan and securities rates and seasonally lower loan fees. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest income was lower by $164 million or 7%. This unfavorable variance was primarily the result of a decrease in Mortgage Banking revenue and seasonally lower payments and deposit service charges, as well as commercial products revenue. The variance in Mortgage Banking revenue largely reflected lower origination and sales revenue, offset by favorable variances in the addition to reps and warranty repurchase reserve and mortgage servicing rights valuation. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense was lower by $216 million, mainly due to the fourth quarter $80 million settlement expense accrual, lower professional services expense due to the reaching of that settlement, favorable variances in insurance and litigation items and seasonally lower operating expense, offset by higher benefits, including pension, and the expense related to low income housing and other tax-advantaged projects.","Turning to Slide 10. Our capital position remains strong and continues to grow. Based on our assessment of the full impact of the current proposed rules for Basel III standardized approach, we have estimated that our Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio was 8.2% at March 31 versus 8.1% at December 31. At 8.2%, we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement and above our targeted ratio of 8%.","In March, we received the results of the 2013 Comprehensive Capital Assessment and Review, the CCAR, including the Federal Reserve's non-objection to our capital plan. Subsequently, we announced a new 1-year buyback authorization totaling $2.25 billion, effective April 1. And we expect to recommend to the Board of Directors that they approve an 18% increase in our common stock dividend in the second quarter. These capital actions will allow us to maintain our goal of returning 60% to 80% of our earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks in 2013. In the first quarter, we returned 69% of our earnings to shareholders, including dividends and repurchase of 17 million shares of common stock.","Finally, Slide 12 provides updated detail on the company's mortgage repurchase-related expense and the reserve for expected losses on repurchases and make-whole payments. The addition to the reps and warranties repurchase reserve this quarter was $36 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2012. Recall that we booked additional reserves in the fourth quarter to address the put-back risk of Freddie Mac loans originated in 2004 and 2005. Our outstanding repurchase and make-whole request balance at March 31 was $66 million compared with $131 million at December 31.","I'll now talk -- turn the call back to Richard.","Richard K. Davis","Thanks, Andy. Turning to Slide 13, you will see the cover of our 2012 Annual Report, \"A Rich Heritage\" and \"A Strong Future.\" And today, we're in Boise, Idaho, the site of our 2013 Annual Shareholders Meeting. I'm looking forward to presenting our shareholders with a brief look at our past and a view into our future. Idaho, in fact, is part of our company's rich heritage, which began 150 years ago, with the signing of our national bank charter in 1863.","The presentation will include the story of how we achieved the size and scale we are today and in particular, what we accomplished in 2012, including record revenue, record earnings and industry-leading performance metrics against the backdrop of a slowly recovering and uncertain environment. Even more important, however, to all of our shareholders is that we have positioned U.S. Bank for a strong future, a future that includes continued investment in our well-diversified mix of businesses, prudent risk management, a focus on operating integrity and compliance, strong capital and liquidity and superior returns for our shareholders. We're looking forward to the future as we move into 2013 with our first quarter now complete, and we remain focused, as always, on producing consistent, predictable, repeatable results for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our communities and our shareholders.","That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer any questions from the audience.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Erika Penala with Bank of America.","Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Richard, your comments on cautious -- your cautious loan growth commentary during the Citi Conference really resonated with the investor community. So I was wondering if you could give us an update on your outlook for the balance of the year.","Richard K. Davis","Thanks, Erika. Yes, much as I wish it were more positive, I think we just need to be realistic in this environment. And while you'll recall that in quarter 4, we grew our linked quarter loans 1.4%, we then suggested, a month ago, that while we wanted to be in the range of 1% to 1.5% for this most recent quarter, we'd be on the low end, and here we are at 1%. My guidance for next quarter, which is as far as I can see, is somewhere between the 1% and 1.5% again. If we get the seasonal lift that we expect and we normally see in the springtime, then we'll in be the middle of that to the high end of that range. If we see a continued cautious nature by our customers, which we've now seen for the last few months, then it might be on the low end of that range, but it'll be somewhere in between. So what I'm saying is it's not going to be robustly coming back on all cylinders, and that makes sense to us because there continues to be a withholding by both consumers and businesses in this uncertain environment, particularly now, on the heels of both the higher FICA costs and what we all know to be some of the slow but eventual sequester impacts, the higher gasoline costs and the lack of any other catalysts for the business community to jump on the need to take action any earlier now, with the commitment of forward interest rates being low for so long. So longer view, second half of the year, I would hope we start moving into the higher end of the 1% to 2% quarter -- linked quarter range. But for now, let's say, we're going to be pretty set in that same kind of range, bound [ph] 1% to 1.5% linked quarter until we see some catalyst.","Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And my follow-up question would be on the expense side. Thank you so much for the color on looking for a low-50s efficiency ratio. And -- but you also mentioned the word \"flexible\" in your prepared remarks. If we fall into the lower end of the range on loan growth, and clearly, Mortgage Banking is a big question mark for the rest of the year, is the main message here is that there is still flexibility remaining in terms of managing the dollar number to keep the efficiency ratio in the low-50s no matter what happens to the revenue side for the rest of the year?","Richard K. Davis","Yes, for a couple of reasons, the answer is yes. I'm fairly comfortable that, as you know, we manage more to operating leverage than we do efficiency ratio. And we've promised that, as this year will be a harder year for revenue growth, at least at the conservative manner in which we run the company, likewise, we're going to be conservative on our expense growth. And as long as revenue grows faster than expenses, you know that you have positive operating leverage and your efficiency ratio gets better. So efficiency for us is a result not a goal, but because of that, I can assure you it will stay in the low-50s. I don't see any reason for that to be any different than it has for the last many years. I'll also add, you'll recall that while we are moving through this consent order and have substantially less cost in compliance for that purpose, we do see the cost of compliance and operating integrity going up, but well within the range of the amount that we are now going to be able to redeploy. So even on a linked quarter basis for a company like ours, while I hated all the money we were spending on the consent order, it now serves as a backdrop for us to use for some redeployment for what I know to be higher expenses in compliance and audit going forward. So we have really no reason -- and if loan growth were to stay slow, as you know, because of our kind of 50-50 mix of spread income and fee income, as long as the seasonality continues to happen, along with our trusts and our payments businesses, and some of the non-balance-sheet items, I also have confidence we can stay in the low-50s as an outcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I realize there's a lot of seasonality in fees quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year, yet you highlighted some of the declines, obviously, in mortgage and private equity. But I guess, just generally speaking, it felt like fees, broadly, were a little bit weaker year-over-year, as we looked at the service charges, the cash management, corporate areas, just some areas that I thought would be grinding higher. I don't know if there's anything kind of unusual that just happened to all hit at once or is it just kind of sluggish client activity overall?","Andrew Cecere","Matt, this is Andy. So first, you're right. The first quarter is seasonally lower across a number of categories. In addition to the seasonality, I'd highlight 2 things. One is in our corporate products -- corporate payments revenue, we have about a 30% exposure to the U.S. government, with a high percentage of that related to the defense department. And government spending is down approximately 15% to 30% depending upon the category. So that is a driver of our -- principal driver of the lower year-over-year and a little lower linked quarter growth that you see in corporate payments. So that's going to depend upon what the future is in terms of government spend, but that is an unusual item that you see there. The second category I bring up is our commercial product revenue. We have particular strength in our high-grade bond underwriting. That's doing very well, and you're reading about the marketplace and how a lot of bond issues are occurring. However, the marketplace is also indicating that FX, loan syndication and some of the more onetime fees are slowing down a bit because -- somewhat because of that high bond underwriting activity. So those are 2 things in addition to seasonality that I would call out.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just separately, following up on the net interest income -- or sorry, the loan growth outlook. As we think about the NIM component from here, any outlook comments on the net interest margin percent?","Andrew Cecere","Yes, so I  -- we had indicated that we would be down 5% to 7%, we were down 7%. I will tell you, my expectation was that is the most it will go down this year. My expectation for the second quarter is closer to 4% to 6%. Part of the reason for that is first quarter has seasonally lower loan fees. And secondly, the compression of what's coming on versus what's coming off is dissipating. So you'll see continued improvement throughout the year and again, second quarter 4% to 6%.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then when you combine that with the low-single digit or low 1% loan growth, do you hold net interest income stable or can you get a little growth out of that?","Andrew Cecere","Relatively stable to perhaps a little bit growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Andy, quick follow-up on the net interest margin. Your margin was very resilient for a lot of the low interest rate environment, and the last couple of quarters, you've had a little leakage down. What's the dynamic there? Did you have some funding cost ability to push that down and that's starting to dissipate? Or can you just give us a little color there?","Andrew Cecere","Yes, John. So that is the reason. In 2012, we had about $12 billion of debt that either matured and was not replaced or was replaced at a much lower cost. That helped us, particularly in the last half of 2012. In 2013, we have a much lower number of debt coming due, so we have less of that repricing that will help us. However, as I said, sort of offsetting that is the difference between what's coming on and off, particularly in the securities portfolio. We'll continue to improve each quarter, so that'll be an offset. But that is the principal dynamic last year versus this year.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then can you just remind us of your positioning to higher interest rates and which interest rates matter most for you?","Andrew Cecere","We're asset-sensitive. We continue to be asset-sensitive. What you saw in the fourth quarter annual report is very similar to what you'll see in the first quarter Q. So we are biased towards positive rates, and the most important part in the curve for us is 3 to 5 years.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then, on the credit side, Richard, I guess you -- do you envision being able to run at a below-average charge-off rate for a considerable amount of time here, both you and the industry? As there hasn't been much lending and housing's improving, do you see credit kind of running below average for a while?","Richard K. Davis","I do, and I think we've predicted that a year ago, that we would all fall below our over-the-term rates and it would take years to come back. I mean, it's just the way the math works. The temptation is for certain companies to decide that now is the time to take maybe a higher level of risk because: a, it won't show up for a while; and b, to stretch [ph] for that asset growth is pretty high. And that temptation is present in our company, but it isn't going to happen. So the fact is, is that we're going to continue to be prudent, and we'll take our hits, if you guys don't like the loan growth. But we're not going to put on, structurally, a deficit asset onto our books for the fear of them being a problem in many years forward. We're just not going to do that. So you'll see us be prudent, and we're not going to -- we're not in the leveraged lending business, to speak of, so we're not enjoying that particular run-up right now. We're not going to get into things like enhanced lease residuals or get into some of the noninterest-related activities. But as I always say, we'll continue to fight for our own customers and continue to build some growth in market share by using our pricing advantage, which, you all know, we have a pretty substantial one, which we can give a part of it back to our best customers and new customers. I'll also remind that our commitments grew almost 12% year-over-year, and annualized linked quarter, 7%. And so we're continuing to enjoy bringing a lot of new customers, and they're still sitting at that 25% usage level. But once and when they start using it, we would hope that whoever has the most customers on their balance sheet with open lines of credit will be the one that does the best, and we're counting on being one of those.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And while it does sound like you'll run below average or over the cycle, you don't see much more improvement from this kind of 79-basis-point level. Do you think you'll just kind of hold somewhere in there?","Richard K. Davis","Yes, I think we fell through the 70s, and we stay in there. And I thought -- 6 months ago, we fell to the low-80s, so it got better faster and probably more sustainably than we thought, which is why you saw some of our actions. But just because of our large credit card portfolio and the mix of business, it shouldn't get much lower than that or we're -- then, we really left too much on the table. Bill, do you want to..","P. W. Parker","Yes, yes. This is Bill. Okay, I mean, the area that still has room for improvement is anything related to the residential mortgage, so residential mortgage, home equity, still high. And over the next year or 2, depending on housing prices, that should continue to come down.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Bill, it looked like the home equity NPLs and charge-offs ticked up a little bit in the first quarter. Is that a seasonality issue?","P. W. Parker","Yes, they will come down again in the second quarter and should be down for the balance of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Miller with FBR.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So on the Mortgage Banking side, a lot of people felt that we've been writing it off for the rest of the year. What's your views for the gain on sale and volumes throughout the year?","Andrew Cecere","So Paul, I'm going to give you -- I don't know the whole year. I'll give you what I can see in the second quarter. And so the first quarter, our fees were down about 15.5%, and that's principally because apps were down. We book about 80% of our revenue at app and the remainder at close. Apps were down about 20%, and gain on sale margins were down 10, 15 basis points, and the offset was positive servicing revenue and the gain on sale -- or excuse me, the servicing hedge. So those are the gives and takes. What we look -- as we look into the second quarter, we believe mortgage revenue will grow, and we believe the application volumes, what we've seen thus far, will increase. So we think that this first quarter was a little bit seasonal, a little bit impacted by the blip in rates that occurred in late February. We're starting to see some strength there, so we expect an increase in mortgage revenue Q2.","Richard K. Davis","And Paul, we're sticking with mortgage. We like it, and we do it well. We think, as I said before, that there will be a purchase money future out there, and we want to have that same market share position, if not greater, with purchase money. So we continue to prioritize our new customers and make sure that their servicing and their -- our performance on their onboarding is exceptional so that they'll be pleased. A refi is also important, but it doesn't have the same time parameters attached to it because you don't have another party involved. And we're going to continue to grow this business and do what we can to improve the mix of where the originations come from, more retail, if we can. But at the same time, we have a very good variability on our expense control, so if things were to continue to fall and be less than we expect, we can adjust to that very quickly, probably within 30 to 60 days, based on the way we staff and the way we've set up our occupancy costs [ph] . So we're able to flex with it, but we like it and we're going to plan on it continue to be strong.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think you have a lot of HARP-eligible loans. I mean, what type of HARP production you're doing right now?","P. W. Parker","About 11% is the HARP for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just wondered if you could just expand on the mortgage side. Can you talk about how your mix of originations has changed? And any market share dynamic changes as you -- as Richard, as you talk about that being prepared for purchase market?","Andrew Cecere","Yes, so first of all, from an origination standpoint, if we think about production, about 72% of the production is refinancing. Only about 62% of the applications, however, are refinancing. So again, that increase in rates that occurred did impact apps, and refinancings did come down in the first quarter. We're starting to see it shift back to more of that 70-30 refinancing. And again, we expect strength in the application volume into quarter 2. Given -- we don't have the full market data yet, but we continue to expect that we'll be either stable or slightly increasing in market share.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. My second question, I wanted to ask you about noninterest-bearing deposits did decline, on average, a decent amount. And I just wanted to ask you to flesh that out a little bit. How much of that was seasonal? How much of it is customers behaving differently? And any changes with regards to even customers starting to potentially use some of their deposits instead of borrowing?","Andrew Cecere","Yes, I think a factor there, Ken, was the elimination of tax. So what we saw at the end of the year was a shift, perhaps, of about $6 billion out of noninterest-bearing, which, at -- until year-end, had unlimited insurance, into a more interest-bearing category. So I think customers thought about it, and said, \"I'm going to go after a few basis points since I don't have unlimited insurance.\" So I think that's the phenomenon that we saw.","Richard K. Davis","Ken, you make a great point. As I've often said, it's a canary in the mine. The first good news for all this industry is the deposits in total moved down because people are using them, then they'll use the lines of credits that they have open to buy and they're paying for and then, eventually, they'll get more loans. This is not that. This is not that first mover, where we're seeing total deposits moving down as a result of customers using it for other things, particularly for growth. They're really withholding. They continue to be cautious, and they're just building up the balance sheet. No matter where they placed it, they're just kind of moving it about to seek a little higher yield.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And Richard, on that point, this should be my last question, just can you just  talk us through -- when you are talking to customers, we've continued to hear about this delay and cautiousness. What are customers looking for to make that change in their minds? So everyone is very flush with cash. Companies are strong from a financial perspective. We're seeing that in credit. But so we continue to hear about delay, delay, delay. What are customers waiting for?","Richard K. Davis","Yes, that's a great question. And it has a lot of answers, but mine would be that it is particularly the lack of a catalyst, perhaps more than it is the uncertainty. Even I'm tired of talking about uncertainty without a very good definition. We could tie it, last year, to fiscal cliff. We could tie it, last quarter, to the pending sequester. We can try to say it's going to be the national debt. It's probably not any of those anymore. There's no reason to take a bite right now at the apple and invest in something that will cost you more, with the uncertainty of not knowing whether or not there's going to be a customer base for you. So what I would say to you, Ken, is you've got the interest rates being decidedly low for a long time, so there's no catalyst for a company to rush to make a decision because rates are eventually going to move up. They probably should be thinking that way, but based on the calculus and what the Fed has done by tying it to unemployment, everyone can see that it's not imminent. So absent that and absent a good deal, where you see the M&A market still has some life to it, most companies are going to continue to just do what they do well, stick to their knitting, be very cautious and be proud of the fact that they're still being profitable. And they're going to wait for a catalyst, which, I think, will be interest rates eventually starting to move up and people taking advantage of that and\/or the consumer getting much stronger, starting to seek more purchase, consumer products and services and then the companies starting to meet that demand. None of that's present today. It's not horrible. It's slow recovery, it's torturously slow, but there's no catalyst to jump on something earlier than you need to.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Foran with Autonomous.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","I wonder if I can follow up on this point you made about it's tempting at this point in the cycle to stretch for growth and maybe people getting to mid and even late cycle underwriting standards in certain products. You referenced leveraged lending is one. Are there other parts of the market that particularly concern you? And maybe if I could specifically hone in on auto a little bit, since you have some slides on it in the back of the deck.","Richard K. Davis","Yes, I'm going to have Bill answer the hard one. I'll take auto because that's very timely. We're one of the larger -- we're the seventh largest auto lender, so it's meaningful, 2.3% market share. But we're also one of the larger auto lessors. And we've been in that business for as many years as auto leasing has been around, so we're good at it. It has a lot of other attributes to it like end of term, used market sales values, all those kinds of things.","And it would be -- one of the opportunities you would have is to enhance your residual value. And so if you're going to get a loan from Bank X, and they're going to say, after a 3-year term, your value is going to be x. And you will get it from us, and we say, after a 3-year term, your value is going to be, let's say, lower, then you're going to have a higher payment with our company because we're going to have you take a larger spread. When the car comes back in 3, 4, 5 years, that's when we have to meet our maker and decide whether or not we expected the value to be higher or lower, and then take an adjustment well outside of the interest income that would have been derived. So as an example, we're just -- we've done this business long enough, we're not going to do something any more than we would take a structural interest -- a structural -- a credit risk on a customer, hoping that they're going to get better when we don't see the evidence. And so autos has a leasing issue that's probably more germane. Let's pause for a minute though and also look at what happened with the CFPB last week, as they're starting to ring-fence the discretion at the pricing level in the auto sales rooms, and you know that the banks are now going to be held accountable for disparate lending behaviors by auto dealers all through the country, as it relates to the kind of upcharges they might provide a customer or add-on products they might deliver. So that's also going to be well worth watching in the next 90 days, to see what the banks are going to do. We immediately responded by ring-fencing the amount of latitude we give our dealers. We'll probably lose a little market share in the beginning, but we know that's the endpoint so we wanted to adjust quickly. And I think you're going to find that this starts moving toward a much more, probably, predictable pricing scheme in auto dealers across the country and probably margin compression, and that may well end up becoming an issue for affordability, as the dealers want to take on some of that profit back in another manner. So auto lending is really in flux given what just happened. But germane to your question, we're simply not going to enhance residuals or take the risk outside of what would otherwise be credit structure. So Bill for the other topics?","P. W. Parker","Yes, I think the other category would be commercial real estate. Historically, banks have liked commercial real estate because it's actually a pretty easy area to generate instant outstanding. There's always a developer with a project and seeking money. So that's an area that, over the years, has been subject to too much money going into too many projects. The way we manage that is we start with our customers. And the first thing we do is really underwrite, understand our customer. It's common that we do not necessarily do every project for our customer base. We look at the ones that we like. It's been a successful strategy for us for decades. So the commercial real estate is the other area.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","I wonder, as a follow-up, if I could almost ask the opposite question. I mean, you've been pretty good at being countercyclical and maybe extending into products when others are still afraid to do them. And are there any opportunities that are still out there like that? And the specific one, I guess, I'm getting at is in residential mortgage. Alt-A has become maybe a dirty word, but at the same time, the whole market's doing 760 average FICOs. You cite yours at 765, with a weighted average LTV of 64%. Is there an opportunity to do some kind of prime minus business? And is this a good point in the cycle to be thinking about that?","P. W. Parker","I'd say less than -- a little different answer than the prime minus. I mean, we've held a lot of our underwriting fairly steady there, and we have the capability to do home equity up to 90% loan-to-value. We haven't changed that in several years. The issue being a lot of people are just not taking advantage of that, getting back to Richard's comment about sentiment, so it's available. We use it in some of our piggyback loans. But the volumes are just not that great. And I think it's less us changing our standards and more the market eventually coming back to them as people get more confidence.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Murray with Nomura.","Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just ask you a question -- you're talking about loan growth. Are you seeing the ability to take share? And which particular loan categories are you seeing it?","Richard K. Davis","This is Richard. Small business for sure. Five years ago, we started a trip to become a really high-quality small business originator, and we won -- we did it through our branch managers. And you're welcome to call any of them, all 3,100 of them. It's -- their job is to be a community leader and know that whole neighborhood like it was a small little town, and part of that goes along with being the bank for the small business owners in and around that location. So we've been taking market share. That continues to be one of our strongest growth both in what you'd call traditional small business, as well as SBA lending. We're the second largest SBA lender at national level at this point as well. So we see a lot of value in being good at that, and it is a real execution game. It's not so much just pricing and product, it's knowing your customer and giving them what they need. The other thing that I would say that we're continuing to focus on in terms of market share grab would be second -- first-position second mortgages. We've been very, very successful at that. It's -- for a lot of people, it's a way to get into the equity without having to go through the typical steps you would have to go for a first-position traditional mortgage. They're very high-quality customers. They like the product. They like the access, and particularly, they don't want to do another credit card. They still feel comfortable using the equity in their home, and those have been 2 really growth businesses for us. Bill, did I miss...","P. W. Parker","Yes. Well, I think, the other big area is really our corporate bank and especially their inroads into the investment-grade space, whether that's through commitments and taking joint lead or lead positions with a number of our clients. And with that, comes the investment-grade underwriting that we established in Charlotte. So I'd say that's another area that's come a long way in the last...","Richard K. Davis","Yes, 4 years ago, 4 years ago, Keith, we didn't really even have that, and now we're leading transactions. And what comes with that too, Bill, is the fee business, which is part of the quid pro quo. So yes, that would be another good place. So we feel we've got a lot of room and space for market share growth in places we're still getting better at. But I think we also have the advantage of being ahead some of the curves on that, and we're going to play it out.","Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division",".","And then on the payment side, you've mentioned the government spending piece of it having an impact. But what's your growth outlook for that business? A lot of clients ask the question. It looks like growth has slowed there. Just what's your view on this space?","Andrew Cecere","So it's -- let me put it by piece. So the merchant growth is going to be a bit of a function of same-store sales growth, which will range somewhere between 3% and 5%, we expect, for the rest of the year. We'll grow a little bit above that because we're adding new customers, but same-store sales drives that. On the card side, it's going to be consumer spend and that -- what we're seeing is spending relatively stable, but the paydown of the loans continues to increase. In other words, revolve rate is such that people are paying down their outstanding debt, so that's what's impacting outstandings. And then on the corporate card side, as we said, we have a fair exposure to the government and T&E spend, both of which are weak for the reasons that Richard already has gone through. So purchasing, the traditional purchasing is stronger, the T&E and government is a little weaker so that will depend, again, on the sentiment on a go-forward basis.","Richard K. Davis","And Keith I'll add, one of our hidden benefits, and it is hidden because it's still growing, is this international growth in our merchant acquiring. You've heard that we closed a deal with Santander last week. We've got this continuing growth in this early stage kind of nascent partnership with Citi down in Brazil. I was in Mexico City just a couple of weeks ago, where we have 400 employees, and we've been working on partnerships with some of the largest merchants in Mexico. And so these are businesses that are fairly young, a few years old, but they're the kind that have the great growth curve. So they're moving from red to pink to gray to black in terms of bottom line, and they've got great trajectories of growth. And that's probably something you'll hear about in future quarters, which isn't present in today's run rate.","Operator","Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of questions, follow-ups. One, you mentioned earlier the mortgage origination revenues, 80% at app, 20% at close. Is there -- what drives that difference? Is it a function of the type of loan that you're originating?","Andrew Cecere","No, you principally book the gain at lock and you book some of the miscellaneous fees at close.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And for your budget, when you're looking out 1 and 2 years, what kind of interest rate environment are you basing that on?","Andrew Cecere","The budget that we planned under is very similar to the CCAR base case budget, Betsy, which is a basically low rate environment for the next couple of years at the low end, with some increase at the longer end towards the end of this year into next year.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So is it fair to say it's in line with what the FOMC is suggesting they're going to do with rates or not?","Andrew Cecere","Yes, it's very close to the Blue Chip consensus.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, on payments space, so obviously, there's a lot going on in the payments industry right now. I just wanted to get your thoughts on how you're thinking about positioning USB longer term, specifically around some of the payment strategies in the U.S. You know that JPM and Visa have signed into a unique partnership. Is there anything that -- in that make -- would make sense for USB? Obviously, you've got your own merchant acquirer, so I wanted to see what your thoughts are there. And then, separately, in non-U.S., you've been increasing your footprint pretty significantly in the merchant acquiring. Is there any more that you could do there? And then lastly, on the Internet space, what kind of options do you have to increase your share of wallet?","Richard K. Davis","Great. This is Richard. I was going to say payments can now mask as either cards or mobile banking, right? So we'll take those separately. On the traditional payment space, we, too, have relationships with partners that we just are working on. And we don't necessarily announce them, so you can read between those lines. By the way, it's not exclusive, what you mentioned with the other banks. So we are in R&D mode in a significant way with all types of ways to use our acquiring partnership with merchants, and in some cases, directly to consumer, a la Square and some of those things that you've read about. So we're not left out of anything. Nothing has come across our desk that we wish we had been a part of, and we're just more likely to announce it once it's been tested and out, as opposed to the fact that we're going to test it. So just trust us, we have a different cycle in which we announce that. As it relates to international, once we get this beachhead down in Brazil, there's a lot of good growth in South America and, as our reputation builds, like I believe it will, as a partner with Citi, where they have a great deal of relationship, we'd expect to see us moving through South America rather like we did moving from west to east across best -- Pan-Europe and then, eventually further along, perhaps down into the Pacific Rim. We're more careful in Asia Pacific because we're not exactly sure of the politics in some of those environments. But like anywhere else, our entire story has always been built on the partnership of another bank that's local to that market, and we work with them to become their preferred merchant provider. It's usually a rent-to-own kind of a relationship, and we bring our international platform, that we've built years ago, and bring it to any country and flip it on and we start doing business. So there's really very few parts of the world, I would tell you, we're not interested in, but we're going to be careful because of the politics that go along with doing business in countries that we may not have the experience, and the partner is going to be more important probably than the country itself. And then as it relates to just mobile payments, we're spending an inordinate amount of time and energy on that as well, both keeping ourselves open for all channel options and for all partner options, which, in many cases, are mobile providers and some of the less-known brands that are being built in garages across the country. So we're spending an inordinate amount of time on that. And you'll see some of our M&A will very likely be the continuation of traditional merchant acquiring, but I will bet you're going to see some purchases of some less-known capabilities and technologies as it relates to the channel of moving money in nontraditional ways, particularly through mobile. So more of that will come, but you'll hear about it, in our case, after it's working, not the announcement of the idea.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then, on the mobile side, that would be something that you could then provide to other financial institutions that you are running their payments business for?","Richard K. Davis","Excellent point. So we will -- as a correspondent bank is to smaller banks, we've been that in the merchant acquiring space forever, where many of these regional banks, smaller banks use us to be their merchant acquirer under private label. We will do exactly the same thing with mobile technology. We'll build it, we'll brand it, we'll white-label it, we'll sell it to them and they can have the benefit. We'll also get the markup.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.","Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I hear what you say about consumer confidence and people not wanting to lever up. But I guess I always kind of viewed that loan growth, and especially consumer loan growth, kind of should go with nominal GDP. And you see auto sales up 40% off the bottom. And while you were speaking, housing starts hit the tape. It was over 1 million units for the first time in a couple of years and 2x off what it was on the bottom. And you think about all the furniture and rugs and all this stuff that goes with housing starts. And just how can it not translate into loan growth? And I'm wondering is it purely consumer behavior or is it some of the new strictures that are on you. Is it like the inability to raise card limits and so on? I just -- how does all this other activity, this   [indiscernible] activity not translate into loans?","Richard K. Davis","Chris, those are all good questions, and we consider them all the time, too. First of all, let's talk about auto loans. Auto loans are probably the squeeze play between the lack of equity in homes and the lack of people's willingness to extend their unsecured credit card any further. So it used to be home equity would mask a great deal of the auto purchasing, and even credit cards would end up allowing people to feel more comfortable that they had other alternatives to pull on. People are paying down their credit card more than they're using it, and people's equity, while probably starting to warm up, hasn't been that good that long for them to be comfortable. So it makes sense to me that autos are probably the single and exclusive space of strength in the consumer side. That's how I've put it into my head at least. But as it relates to kind of the next steps, you've got the consumer is -- like a small business, like a large corporation, they've figured out that they can be better with their budgets than they thought they could. They can find out they can live on less than they thought they could. And they do not want to get -- once burnt, twice shy. And so the behaviors are reasonable, but they're more emotional than they are practical or financial, and I think this will eventually recover as people feel more comfortable. They now know what their cost is going to be in their paycheck every 2 weeks now that FICA has been changed. They're probably getting a better sense of what's going to happen in terms of the cost of gasoline as we move into the summer months, and they start looking whether they've got money for a vacation. This is the perfect time of the year where we're in a flux to figure out where things are going to settle. And in our company, April and May pretty much tell us the rest of the year. We don't trust the first quarter for a lot of reasons. I don't go -- have to go much past May to know how the year is going to go, but we're right on the heels of figuring out what the consumer behavior will be. And I'll tell you it's probably going to be cautious because, for the same reasons I mentioned for corporate, there's no catalyst, but for to be careful and protect yourself, given the uncertainty of what things could happen.","Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So your view is it's purely behavioral, it's not the new regulations and structure?","Richard K. Davis","Yes, thank you. For our company, it's not the latter. We are not bound by capital, by regulators, by any enforcement actions. We're simply doing the business we think is safe, sound and repeatable, and so far that's been aligned with what the regulators would expect.","P. W. Parker","Yes. And I'll also point out the -- I mean, the housing starts statistic is heavily weighted now with multifamily starts, so the single family, I see, is actually down. And so when you talk about consumer sentiment, I mean, it's, yes, you build an apartment building, you need carpet, but what you're talking about is this consumer going out and buying a new home and refurnishing and et cetera, and that's a different behavior. And that's still fairly tepid.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Werner with Morningstar.","Dan Werner - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I apologize if -- I got in the call late. With regard to the allowance of loan losses and given that you're improving asset quality and even provisioning slightly less than what you're charging off, where do you see the loan loss reserve long term?","P. W. Parker","Well, I'm not going to comment long term but...","Dan Werner - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Or at least for the rest of the year.","P. W. Parker","That's still very...","Richard K. Davis","That's forever.","P. W. Parker","We usually go a quarter at a time. But in general terms, there's still a little more room for improvement in the credit profile. There's still wholesales almost back to what I'd call prerecession levels. But there's still a few things to work out so that will give us a little more relief on the allowance. But basically, it's similar to what it's been doing.","Operator","Your next question comes from Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Andy, a couple of questions, just some follow-up. First, in terms of kind of you were mentioning on the spread outlook kind of stable to maybe some growth. What I'm curious about is how we should think about the earning asset mix with the balance sheet. Obviously, it's been growing. And one of the things that stands out is really the growth in mortgage held on balance sheet, and this quarter, we saw a bit of a drop-off in terms of held for sale. So I'm just wondering how to think about kind of the ongoing mortgage retained on balance sheet, how you think about perhaps the fee income versus the spread component in conjunction with your comments on the spread.","Andrew Cecere","Right. So there are a few questions in there. First, let me make it clear that qualifying mortgages, Freddie, Fannie, we are not holding in our balance sheet other than held for sale, so we are selling those. What you're seeing in terms of mortgage traditional loans on the balance sheet is first, our Smart Refinance product, which is that branch-based mortgage originated high-quality customer, that is not a Freddie, Fannie product. That's what you're seeing growing, and we would expect continued growth there for the reasons we've talked about. In terms of, I want to be also clear, net interest income, we expect to be relatively stable to some growth. We do still see some expectation for that 4- to 6-basis-point decline more than [ph]  offset by the earning asset growth. And finally, I would say that I expect loan and securities growth to sort of be in sync. So we've stopped in terms of the build on the securities portfolio and it'll grow in conjunction with overall balance sheet growth.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's really helpful. And then, just switching gears a little bit, in terms of, again, like the mortgage outlook, if you will, but in particular on the reps and warranties. You guys had a nice drop-off this quarter in terms of the associated costs on the repurchase risk, as well as on the legal side, as well. I was just wondering how we should think about the provisions, if you will, on a go-forward basis. Is that more in sync with current production levels? Are we going to see more of a drop-off and decline in the reserve? Or how should we think about that?","Andrew Cecere","Right. So as you recall, in the fourth quarter, we increased our reserve, principally due to the look-back period on Freddie Mac going back a couple of more years. So that was unusually high. The first quarter may be a little bit low because of timing and some of the work-through of that additional look-back period. But I do expect that to sort of be stable to down in future quarters. So I think we've reached the peak there in terms of the addition to reserve, and we'll start to see it come down.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, similarly, I don't know if the question was addressed before, but just in terms of litigation. Again, relative to some of your bigger peers, the legal, while it's difficult to predict, if you will, it seems like we might be in a better or kind of more stable run rate, if you will, in terms of how we think about the legal going forward in terms of in your existing accruals.","Andrew Cecere","There is no unusual legal accruals in the first quarter. As you recall, the fourth quarter had the $80 million, but first quarter was relatively straightforward.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. So first quarter looks like more of like consistent in terms of the outlook?","Andrew Cecere","Nothing unusual from a litigation reserve standpoint.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Barker with Compass Point.","Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","15% markup in the MSR this quarter, and the MSR looks like it's valued at about 7.7% of total Tier 1 common equity per Basel III. Could you just talk about how you expect to manage that if the MSR continues to mark up, if we have an increase in rates here?","Andrew Cecere","Yes, so you're talking about the potential impact to reduction in capital?","Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Yes.","Andrew Cecere","Yes, so we have plenty of room there. So part of the reason for the increase in the value was the increase in rates that we talked about. But from an overall standpoint, we could almost double our securities port -- or MSR book and still not have the haircut from a Basel III perspective. So we're not bound by that. We continue to expect to grow the mortgage business, as we talked about. And again, as we talked about, we expect that to grow more in the second quarter relative to the first quarter because of the seasonality, but we're not bound by MSR in capital.","Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Is part of that due to deferred tax liabilities associated with MSR?","Andrew Cecere","A lot of -- there's a lot of different calculations, but that is not a binding constraint right now.","Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then also you had -- 11% of your loans were HARP, which is similar to what you had in the last couple of quarters. Was the reason why the HARP mix continues to stay elevated due to you're doing cross-servicer refis? Or is it just your own book where you're doing HARP loans?","Andrew Cecere","It's primarily our own book.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Mutascio with KBW.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Andy, I want to make sure I wrote down a couple of things right. Did you say the gain on sale was down only 15 basis points? Because I'm coming out with a much bigger hit to the gain on sale margin this quarter.","Andrew Cecere","Yes, and the reason for that -- and I know, Chris, where you're coming from. So the reason for that is you calculated it on production, which is what we're putting in our reports. And I'm doing it on net apps after fallout expectation.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. I just make sure...","Andrew Cecere","And our apps -- right, so production while it looks sort of flattish, apps are down closer to about 20%. So if you go through the math on that, you'll see the gain on sale margins down 10 or 20 basis points.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that explains the difference from what I was doing. Staying with mortgage for a quick second. You mentioned that 2Q could be up over for -- over 1Q in terms of Mortgage Banking income. There's kind of 4 puts and takes in mortgage. There's production volume, your gain on sale margin, I guess, servicing and your rep and warranty expense. Of those 4 little subsets, which one is going to be better than first quarter in order to drive an upward pressure in Mortgage Banking, first to second?","Andrew Cecere","Application volume. The others might be better, too, but the application volume is going to be the key driver.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And that's just because of seasonality.","Andrew Cecere","Principally seasonality and principally because of that slowdown of the curve with the increasing rates in the middle of the first quarter.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And you're pretty confident in this?","Andrew Cecere","I tell you what I know.","Richard K. Davis","We only say what we know.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nancy Bush with NAB Research.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","I have a capital question for you, Richard. I mean, the big discussion, if you want to put it that way, today, is the proper level of capital for the systemic banks and this whole Brown-Vitter and is it going to be 10%? Is it going to be 15%, whatever? I think we're all sort of coming to the conclusion that the largest banks are probably going to have to have more capital even than Basel dictates. So do you see this as a competitive advantage for you? Or do you think that these demands for higher capital will then trickle down to the next tier of large banks, in which you and a number of the other large regionals reside?","Richard K. Davis","Nancy, good question. First of all, we're just a little tiny bank from Bloomington [ph]. I want to make sure you all know that. I'm convinced that there will be a ratability here. There will be a sliding scale. Even if it doesn't look like it at first, if you recall the G-SIFI or G-SIB requirements, we were the first bank not to be given one, but we were uncomfortable to have 0 as a buffer in our minimum capital charge. We just know it couldn't be 0, but we were not given a number, so we picked 50 basis points. I think that this whole \"too big to fail\" issue has been -- we have failed as an industry to provide confidence to the people who worry the most, that we really have ring-fenced this problem by 6 ways to Sunday. And as the bank that might otherwise look like an advantaged bank, because we're not typically in that first conversation, we're going to be affected by it, in some manner, as well. And I believe, for the good of this country, we need to have banks larger than us and we need to have banks smaller than us. But we are preparing to be part of something, and we think we'll get our pro rata share. I don't think it'll be excessive, but I don't think it'll be advantageous either. I think we'll get our fair measure of whatever the rule is here to try to make banks safer. And if capital's a measure, so be it.  If it's loan losses, it might be that. It might be a liquidity ratio. It could be all kinds of things. I'm worried that \"too big to fail\" is just introducing the idea that we need so many different ways to protect the banks that we'll become so risk-free that we'll end up losing our benefits to those of you who invest in us. So that's a bigger worry, but I think we will get whatever is fair and assigned to us based on our size and our complexity. I don't see it as an advantage or a disadvantage. I think the whole thing, though, is a disappointment, because we should do a better job of convincing people who are worried that we really have this ring-fenced.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","Do you think that the concept of risk-weighted assets is going to still be with us? Or are we going to go back to just assets?","Andrew Cecere","Nancy, this is Andy. I think we'll still have risk-weighted assets, and maybe a tangible ratio will come into play in addition. One of the things I want to highlight, in our bank, our risk-weighted asset Basel III to our total GAAP asset is about 87%. So we're not -- we don't have a huge discount on the risk weightings that you're reading about in some others. So it may come into play, but it won't be a big deal for us.","Operator","Our final question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Back on the payments. I guess looking at least through the first 2 months of the year, Visa had, had -- had kind of talked about their volume in U.S. credit. And your consumer business seems to be somewhat slower. I know you mentioned T&E being somewhat slower, but are there any other things going on? And kind of got a follow-up on the partnership thing that you had mentioned.","Richard K. Davis","Moshe, on the merchant side, our portfolio is heavily weighted toward resorts, airlines, hoteliers, not retail. And those are areas that are typically very slow in first quarter, they always are. And they're even slower right now based on the T&E spend of some of the corporations. So that's why we might be slightly disparate, because we're not heavy -- as heavy on retail as the averages you would hear from MasterCard or Visa.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And you mentioned kind of talking to Visa about potential partnerships, but waiting until they're a little more clearly defined. What's your view as to what that could accomplish?","Richard K. Davis","Well, I won't talk to any one specific deal, but the goal that everyone's trying to figure out is who's going to carve out what space, as it relates to the interlopers that are not financial institutions, in moving money for people in nontraditional ways. I should write that down because that was a long sentence. But the fact of the matter is that's what we're trying to do. When you're a merchant acquirer, you're the only group that has a shot at it. And if you blow it, then you're going to have an interloper come in and take a position that we've otherwise had as one of the people -- trusted parties in a transaction between consumers and merchants, so that's really where this is at for us. That's why I tell you we're dealing with many partners, we're dancing with a lot of different folks. We can do all kinds of different dances if we need to, but we're not leaving ourselves out of the conversation. We're in virtually every one to decide what we think is the surviving technology or the surviving partner or the surviving customer behavior, and it's changing pretty quickly. So all you should know from us is that we're not waiting and going to be left standing by ourselves. We're out trying all kinds of different things. I just think it's a more prudent approach to deliver on things and show you even pilots before we announce partnerships. You can just trust me on this call. We're partnering with everybody you'd want us to, to make sure we're not leaving out the advantage that accrues to a 30-year merchant acquirer, who's already in this space and does it very well and everybody wants to be a partner with.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got you. One last follow-up and that is, you did mention M&A. And it's interesting because, after a couple of years in which Visa, MasterCard, American Express have been making a lot of acquisitions and there'd been a lot of acquisition in this space, it kind of died out. Could you talk a little bit about what you might be thinking about in terms of relative size of transactions? Because you sounded like there's stuff going on.","Richard K. Davis","Yes, yes. It wouldn't be very big. I think I tried to mention it would be names you haven't heard of and people who put it together in a garage 2 years ago. It's a technology, intellectual property we'd like to buy. We're big enough that we can bring it in-house and we can manage things and do them ourselves. But kind of a nascent technology that we think starts to work is better brought in-house. We can then own it, probably bring them in with us and have them help us to derive some of that. But we're better off to buy their idea than have to try to create a laboratory where we have everyone trying to come up with something new. And there are people out there doing that today. It will not be names that you're going to be looking at today in the paper, and they're not going to be big transactions that would cause you to change the sense of balance of how we make our money.","Judith T. Murphy","Okay. Thanks, Brooke, for hosting. And I want to thank everyone for listening to our call.

Andy Cecere and Terry Dolan are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp\u2019s fourth quarter results and to answer your questions. Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.","I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today\u2019s call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today\u2019s presentation, in our press release, and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Andy.","Andy Cecere","Thanks Jen, and good morning everyone, and thank you for joining in our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry and I will take your questions.","I\u2019ll begin on Slide 3. We reported earnings per share of $0.90, which included $0.18 per share of notable items which Terry will discuss in more detail in a few moments. Excluding these notable items, we reported earnings per share of $1.08 for the quarter. ","Loan growth was driven by new client wins and deepening relationships across all our loan portfolios, and we delivered very strong deposit growth. We continue to see strong account and volume growth across our fee businesses. Credit quality was stable and our book value per share increased 6.7% from a year ago. ","In November, we received approval from the Fed Reserve for an incremental share repurchase plan authorizing the purchase of up to $2.5 million of common stock in addition to our existing authorization of $3 billion. In the fourth quarter, we returned $2.9 billion of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.","As indicated on Slide 4, digital uptake trends remain strong. We are significantly wrapping up the launch of our DIY digital experiences that will continue to drive more and more customer interactions both on and off the mobile app, as well as higher digital transaction volume. ","Slide 5 provides key performance metrics. On a core basis, we delivered an 18.1% return on tangible common equity in the fourth quarter. For the full year, our core return on tangible common equity was 18.8%. ","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Terry to provide detail on the quarter as well as forward-looking guidance.","Terry Dolan","Thanks Andy. If you turn to Slide 6, I\u2019ll start with a balance sheet review followed by a discussion of fourth quarter earnings trends. Average loans grew 0.8% on a linked quarter basis and increased 3.9% year-over-year. Linked quarter growth was driven by strength in residential mortgages, commercial real estate, and credit card loans. The C&I pay down activity muted overall growth in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting the rate environment and robust capital markets conditions. New commercial business activity is healthy; however, pay down activity is likely to continue to be a headwind near term, albeit a diminishing headwind assuming that the interest rate environment is stable.","Turning to Slide 7, deposits increased 1.9% on a linked quarter basis and grew 6.6% year over year. Notably, average savings deposits grew by 11.1% driven by across-the-board growth in wealth management investment services, consumer banking, and commercial banking.","Turning to Slide 8, credit quality was stable in the fourth quarter. On a dollar basis, non-performing assets declined approximately 15% on both a linked quarter and a year-over-year basis. The ratio of non-performing assets to loans plus other real estate owned also improved linked quarter and year-over-year. The new accounting standard related to credit losses, commonly known as CECL, became effective January 1 and has no impact on our 2019 results. We estimate that the adoption of CECL will result in a $1.5 billion cumulative effect adjustment to our allowance for loan losses compared with December 31, 2019, which is in line with our previous guidance.","Slide 9 highlights fourth quarter earnings results. We reported earnings per share of $0.90, which included several notable items which reduced earnings by $0.18 per share. Excluding these notable items, we reported earnings of $1.08 per share.","Slide 10 lists the notable items that affected earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2019. Fourth quarter 2019 notable items included restructuring charges, including severance and certain asset impairments, and an increased derivative liability related to Visa shares previously sold by the company. ","As a reminder, we recognized several notable items during the fourth quarter of 2018, including a gain on the sale of our ATM servicing business, the sale of the majority of the company\u2019s covered loans, as well as charges related to severance, asset impairments, and an accrual for certain legal matters. Along with the favorable impact of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to changes in estimates from tax reform, the net impact of notable items in 2018 was an increase of $0.03 per share.","My remarks for the remainder of the call will be referencing results excluding notable items incurred in the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018.","Turning to Slide 11, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis declined by 3% year-over-year, in line with our expectations as the impact of loan growth and higher yields on reinvestment of securities was more than offset by the impact of a flatter yield curve and deposit funding mix. Our net interest margin declined by 10 basis points versus the third quarter. About four basis points of the decline was due to higher premium amortization expense in the investment securities portfolio. The remainder of the pressure can be attributed to the yield curve compression and earning asset mix, partly offset by lower deposit costs. We expect the net interest margin to be stable in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter. ","Slide 12 highlights trends in non-interest income. On a year-over-year basis, we saw good growth in merchant acquiring revenue driven by account and volume improvement. As expected, credit and debit card revenue declined 1% year-over-year due to fewer processing days in the fourth quarter of 2019. We look for credit and debit card revenue to return to the mid-single digit growth pace in 2020.","Corporate payment products revenue declined 3.1% driven by lower commercial business sales volumes; however, in the past few weeks, sales volume growth has returned to a mid-single digit growth rate. Trust and investment management growth reflected business growth and favorable market conditions.","Deposit service targets were impacted by the sale of the company\u2019s ATM servicing business in the fourth quarter of 2018. The decline in treasury management fees from a year ago reflected the impact of changes in earned credits, a residual effect of the raising rate environment in 2018. Notably, treasury management fees increased on a linked quarter basis, reflective of the recent interest rate declines in the third and fourth quarters of 2019.","Mortgage banking revenue increased 42.7% year-over-year on strong origination and sales revenue growth. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2018, mortgage production volume increased by 92.3% and mortgage application volume increased by 83.8%. ","Refinancing activity represented approximately [indiscernible] in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to about 40% in the linked quarter. Refinancings represent 52% of applications in the fourth quarter. As of November, our digital mortgage app was being utilized by about 86% of all mortgage applications.","Turning to Slide 13, the 3.1% year-over-year increase in non-interest expense reflected increased personnel expense, higher technology and communication expense, and higher net occupancy and equipment expense, reflecting actions to support business growth. ","Slide 14 highlights our capital position. At December 31, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel 3 standardized approach was 9.1%. ","I will now provide some forward-looking guidance. For the first quarter of 2020, we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to decline at a low single digit pace year-over-year, but to be relatively flat linked quarter normalized for day count. We expect mid-single digit growth in fee revenue year-over-year. We expect low single digit growth in non-interest expenses on a year-over-year basis. Credit quality in the first quarter is expected to remain stable compared to the fourth quarter, and we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 20% on a full year basis.","I\u2019ll hand it back to Andy for closing comments.","Andy Cecere","Thanks Terry. We are operating in a dynamic environment and this quarter\u2019s results reflected the challenging interest rate environment facing the entire industry, as well as the impact of actions we took to better position our company for the future. However, as our core financial metrics indicate, we ended the year on a solid note and we are in a strong position as we head into 2020.","We view the interest rate environment as a manageable headwind and we are confident in our ability to prudently grow our balance sheet and gain market share in our fee businesses.","Fee growth was negatively impacted by several headwinds in 2019. As Terry discussed, we expect a return to normalized growth in credit and debit card revenue this year. In a more stable interest rate environment, as the refi-driven market shifts to a purchase-driven market, the investments we have made in our mortgage business over the past several years will become increasingly evident in the form of market share gains.","We are proud of our strong and consistent financial track record, but we are always looking for ways to improve. That means we are changing the way we think, the way we work, and the way we do business. As we move into 2020 and beyond, we will continue to increase workflow agility and speed to market for our products and services while at the same time optimizing our core operation to fund investment for the future.","Our ability to leverage the combined power of our rapidly improving digital capabilities and our complete payment ecosystem will lead to higher customer satisfaction, stronger revenue growth and efficiencies, and ultimately improved returns.","In summary, we remain focused on managing this company for the long term while delivering [indiscernible] pathway to the future. I\u2019d like to thank our employees for all we accomplished this year, supported by their hard work and commitment to creating value for our customers. ","We will now open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Your first question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore. Go ahead, please, your line is open.","John Pancari","Morning. Just wanted to talk a little bit about the operating leverage expectation. I got your comments around the quarter, but for full year 2020, I know you had previously indicated that it could be a challenge to attain positive operating leverage for the full year, given the rate backdrop, etc. I wanted to get your updated thoughts on that, if you see that there is a chance that you can get--you could see positive operating leverage, and what type of magnitude could you see?","Terry Dolan","Yes John, thanks. As a reminder, we had a goal of achieving positive operating leverage in 2019, and we did that on a core basis for the full year. When we think about 2020, our objective is to target positive operating leverage and we expect our expense growth to continue to remain in those low single digits. I think we have a number of levers that we continue to look at and pull in terms of optimization. We continue with our physical asset optimization of the branch system, our back office activities, and a number of different things. That\u2019s our goal, that\u2019s our objective at this point in time.","That said, as you said in your question, 2020 is a more difficult year simply because of the revenue outlook, and I think part of being able to achieve it is going to be really based upon what happens with respect to interest rates, etc. That\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it.","John Pancari","Okay, great. Thanks. Then in terms of some of the headwinds that had impacted your fee progression, I know there was an accounting change that impacted it as well as a couple other items. Can you just talk about where do you expect underlying momentum to build in the fee businesses as you look at 2020?","Terry Dolan","Yes, when we end up looking at fee income, I think there\u2019s a number of different things that we end up looking at. I think the credit card revenue is stronger - again, mid-single digits as we think about next year, and that particular line item was impacted by both an accounting item in 2018 as well as a pretty slow first quarter, which we had talked about. I think merchant acquiring continues to accelerate and get strong, and we expect mid-single digits there; and then the CPS revenue, while we saw a decline in the fourth quarter because of a little slower commercial spending, that has come back in the first several weeks of the year, so our expectation in that category is kind of mid-single digits as well.","Deposit services charges has been a drag this year because of the sale of the ATM business in 2018, so that kind of normalizes or is at least flat in 2020. I think treasury management revenue is another area that we would expect has kind of hit an inflection point, so while it\u2019s down on a year-over-year basis, it is up on a linked quarter basis and we would expect that to be better than 2020. I think there\u2019s a number of different things.","I think the offset to that is if we think about mortgage, when we talk about mortgage, mortgage has been particularly strong the last couple of quarters, but in 2019 it was also quite a bit of a drag in the first several quarters. So again, depending on what happens with interest rates, in the current environment I think that continues to be a positive story. I think there\u2019s a number of different areas.","John Pancari","Okay Terry, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.","Erika Najarian","Yes, good morning. ","Terry Dolan","Hey Erika, how are you doing this morning?","Erika Najarian","Good, thank you. I heard you loud and clear on your expense growth, and I\u2019m wondering though if the increased severance charges that we\u2019ve seen could lead to a different geography in terms of expense growth. I\u2019m just looking back at your headcount, which seems to have risen along - coincident with the consent order, and I\u2019m wondering if part of the initial statement up front, Andy, in terms of continuing to transform the business is trying to take some of the compensation growth that you experienced over the last three years and really putting that back in technology. Is that how we should expect the geography could change underneath that low single digit expense growth that you\u2019re expecting for 2020?","Andy Cecere","I think that\u2019s not an unfair description, Erika. It\u2019s not just technology but it\u2019s people and technology, but it\u2019s optimizing the way we\u2019re doing business to continue to invest in the future. Our expense growth was higher during the consent order periods, but as you know, it\u2019s been in the low single digits the last couple of years, including notable items - 2.4% year-over-year in 2019, and that includes optimization and expense take-out while at the same time investing in technology and people for the future, and I would expect that to continue into 2020.","Erika Najarian","I guess I\u2019m wondering if our takeaway from that is because that seems like it\u2019s behind you, and again it feels like the severance charges are setting up for further optimization and rationalization, that you\u2019re accelerating the amount of dollars that you\u2019re putting into the future, so to speak, whether it\u2019s headcount related to that or technology itself.","Terry Dolan","Yes, I think that that\u2019s a fair comment, Erika, and again I think the shift is optimizing what I would call the back office and the branch network, which are being impacted by customer behaviors as we transition to more of a digital environment, but at the same time we\u2019re reinvesting that in technology spend to support that digital transformation, so maybe a little bit of a shift from compensation to technology type of costs. But our expectation when we think about 2020 is to continue to make the investments in the business that we have been making over the last couple of years.","Erika Najarian","Thank you. Just one more, if I could squeeze it in. Deposit costs were down15 basis points quarter over quarter, and I\u2019m wondering underneath the 1Q NII outlook what you expect for deposit cost trends for the first quarter, and also if the curve outlook continues to be stable from here, could net interest margin for the rest of the year stabilize or potentially increase from 1Q levels?","Terry Dolan","Yes, well certainly if the rate environment continues where it is today, our expectation is that 2020 net interest margin would be pretty flat to the fourth quarter with some possible positive bias depending upon what happens on the long end of the curve. That\u2019s kind of our thought process, and the reason for that is the premium amortization that we\u2019ve experienced in the third and fourth quarter is stabilizing at this particular point in time.","When we think about deposit costs, deposit pricing, we have been pretty responsive on the institutional deposits in terms of bringing those, re-pricing those down as rates have come down, and I think from here on out, deposit pricing will be a function of both competition and what happens on the short end of the curve.","Erika Najarian","Got it, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Go ahead, please, your line is open.","Scott Siefers","Morning guys. Thank you for taking the question. Just curious if you might be able to offer any top level comments on the overall pace of loan growth and overall demand. If you look at the H8 data, it\u2019s definitely been held up or supported by the consumer side, but it\u2019s been a little surprising to see the slowdown in growth on the commercial side, however. I\u2019m just curious given the breadth of your franchise and different types of customers you look at, what you\u2019re seeing at a very top level.","Terry Dolan","Yes, at a very high level, again I think economically we feel pretty optimistic in terms of what the outlook there is. If you end up looking at the components of loan growth, I think we saw pretty strong and good growth with respect to consumer lending. The area that was a little bit softer in the fourth quarter was really our C&I or our corporate lending, and that\u2019s principally while we saw production and the pipeline continuing to be reasonably strong, we saw pretty significant pay downs that were taking place in that space driven by capital markets activities, and that\u2019s a function of the long end of the curve coming down in the third and fourth quarter. With that stabilizing, while we would expect some of the pay downs to continue into the first quarter, I think that will moderate.","Scott Siefers","Okay, perfect. Thank you. Then just any additional updates on ramification from the LCR rules? I think you guys have been talking about $11 billion to $15 billion of liquidity free-up. Any updated thoughts on how you\u2019re thinking about that dynamic?","Terry Dolan","Yes, that\u2019s in the ballpark in terms of the amount of--what the impact is with respect to LCR. We\u2019re continuing to look at different alternatives, and part of it is thinking about extending duration a little bit, possibly investing a little bit more in agency mortgage-backed securities, which would provide a little bit better yield. But I think it will be on the margin and it won\u2019t be anything dramatic.","Scott Siefers","All right, that\u2019s perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Jennifer Thompson for closing remarks. ","Oh, it looks like we did get one question. We do have a question from the line of Vivek Juneja from JP Morgan Chase. Go ahead, please, your line is open.","Vivek Juneja","Thank you. Hi Andy, hi Terry. Just wanted to clarify on credit-debit card fees, what was the impact from two for your processing base? How should--what does that do, and is there a reversal in 2020?","Terry Dolan","Yes, good question. There was an impact of two days that ended up really taking our fee income from low to middle single digits to negative 1% in the fourth quarter. There is one extra day in 2020 relative to 2019, but let me just dissect it a little bit because I think that that is maybe helpful.","When you end up looking at the growth rate for 2019, it was really impacted by three different things. One is that there was an accounting change that occurred in the first quarter of 2018 that, because of the lapping effect, ended up depressing growth rates in 2019. In addition, if you remember the consumer spend level in the first quarter was significantly lower and was kind of at an unusually low level, and of course as concerns around the economy stabilized, that consumer spend has come up. That has been in the mid single digits in the second, third and fourth quarter in terms of sales volumes. Then as you know, getting back to the processing days, quarterly results can be lumpy, but when we think about 2020 in terms of on a full year basis, we really think that mid-single digits is a good target for us and a good estimate for us. Our sales volumes over the last several quarters have been in that range, and when you think about it on a day-adjusted basis, it\u2019s been pretty consistent from quarter to quarter.","So in 2020, there is one more day and that will help a little bit, but mid-single digits for 2020, I think is a good estimate. Again, quarterly results will be a little bit lumpy, but when we think about the year, that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re thinking about it.","Vivek Juneja","When I look back over the prior couple of years, you\u2019d had--you know, this line item was growing at sort of more like 9% to 9.5% when you look at \u201917 to \u201918. Going to the mid-single digits, has there been any reduction in pricing, a shift in the kind of contracts, or is this higher reward expense? What, Terry, is driving that slowdown from that high single digit level to the mid-single digit run rate?","Terry Dolan","Yes, the growth rates in 2017 - 2018 were influenced in some respect because of some portfolios that we were acquiring during that particular time frame, more so than other factors, so when we think about pricing, there hasn\u2019t been a lot of compression with respect to pricing. We feel pretty good about that.","Andy Cecere","And rewards have been relatively flat, so actually that isn\u2019t a factor. That mid-single digit number is a good way to think about the next 12 months.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. As you think in terms of other fee revenues, Andy and Terry, you said treasury management should be good. Corporate card fees, when I look at that, that was also a little bit softer this quarter. It\u2019s actually down year-on-year. Any color on that, because I know the--yes, I\u2019ll just let you answer that.","Andy Cecere","Yes Vivek, the impact of that is because we saw in the last half of the fourth quarter, corporate spend activity slowed. That had been running in the mid-single digits, a little bit higher in the first few quarters. Fourth quarter saw a slowdown to almost flat, and as Terry mentioned in his prepared remarks, we did see a pick-up in the first two weeks of January back to the mid-single digits. So that was attributable to that slowdown, but it seems to have come back.","Terry Dolan","I think that one of the reasons for that is if you think about where the yield curve--how rates were moving, there was concern about a recession, people were uncertain with respect to economic data, and then you had the hangover of tariffs. I think the sentiment on the corporate side appears to be looking better. We\u2019re going to be signing trade agreement with China today, I believe, in terms of phase one, and the US-Mexico-Canada agreement is well on its way, so I think that some of that uncertainty that might have been impacting discretionary spend in the commercial side of the equation has been alleviated, so we feel pretty good.","Vivek Juneja","I want to confirm one last thing - CECL Day 2, could you talk a little bit about what you see that doing to your provision expense, Andy, Terry?","Terry Dolan","Yes, we\u2019ve talked about certainly Day 1 and Day 2 as part of investor day. The provision will increase. We think that in terms of loan growth, providing it\u2019s kind of that 2% level versus 1.5%, is kind of how we\u2019re thinking about it, but there\u2019s going to be more volatility related to CECL and I think one of the things we\u2019ll end up looking at is just what is the stability in the overall portfolio and what are net charge-offs doing on a quarter to quarter basis. ","Vivek Juneja","All right, thank you.","Operator","We do have another question from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Go ahead, please, your line is open.","Amanda Larsen","HI everyone, this is Amanda Larsen on for Ken. ","Terry Dolan","Yes Amanda, how are you doing?","Amanda Larsen","Great, thanks. I think it\u2019s understood that 2020 will likely be an aberration versus the long term trends that you set out at investor day related to revenue growth headwinds, but that you\u2019ll still strive to achieve positive operating leverage in \u201920. But I\u2019m wondering, how negative could negative operating leverage be in \u201920 before you do take actions related to slowing the pace of investment spend or creating more saves?","Andy Cecere","As Terry mentioned again earlier, we expect and target positive operating leverage for 2020. We have a number of levers that we continue to pull to optimize the current organization structure to continue to invest in the future. Amanda, the way we think about is a balance of optimizing today and investing in the future while always targeting that positive operating leverage, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re managing the company. ","Amanda Larsen","Okay, great. Then, can you guys talk about the capability add of Sage Pay and how you see U.S. Bank\u2019s position evolving in the ecommerce payment arena over the medium term? Thanks.","Terry Dolan","Yes, we\u2019re very excited about Sage Pay. It is a leader in the ecommerce space within the U.K. and Ireland, and we also have the opportunity to be able to extend that into the rest of Europe. We have a pretty big footprint across Europe, so pretty excited about that as we think about next year.","We ended up rolling out sort of similar ecommerce capabilities over the course of the last 12 to 18 months here domestically, so we believe that that gives us more capabilities in terms of being able to take advantage of ecommerce in the future.","Amanda Larsen","Awesome, thanks. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous. Go ahead, please, your line is open.","John McDonald","Hey guys. Sorry, I jumped on a little bit late. Did you give an update on the Charlotte expansion, Andy, and how that\u2019s going and whether you\u2019re targeting new areas for this year to expand on the retail side?","Andy Cecere","Good morning, John. Charlotte is going well. We opened the branch about three months ago. We\u2019ve had new customer acquisition growth and current customers. Employees are fired up. We are targeting a number of new branches to be opening up this year and still targeting that number of 10. We\u2019re learning a lot from that investment. We continue to track that and measure our activity and I would expect us to continue to expand in new markets, but our first focus is expanding to our target number in Charlotte.","John McDonald","Got you, okay. Then Terry, just a couple clean-up things on NII. I think you mentioned the amortization kind of stabilizes early this year - is that right? Then the roll-off rates, where the 10-year is today, are those breakeven or slightly accretive, and where you\u2019re putting money to work in the bond portfolio today relative to what\u2019s rolling off? ","Terry Dolan","Yes, so addressing your second question first, the reinvestment with respect to securities is still about 15 basis points or so accretive, so we would expect that based upon where rates are today. The premium amortization does stabilize in the first quarter, so when we think about net interest margin for the year, we think it\u2019s going to be relatively flat, maybe a little bit of positive bias relative to the fourth quarter of 2019.","John McDonald","Okay, so the down NII for the year is just the tough comps of where you started last year? I guess from a sequential standpoint, though, sales relatively stable?","Terry Dolan","Yes.","John McDonald","Okay, thank you.","Operator","With that, there are no further questions in queue. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Jennifer Thompson for closing remarks.","Jennifer Thompson","Thank you everyone for listening to our earnings call.

Welcome to U.S. Bancorp's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Following a review of the results by Andy Cecere, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately noon, Eastern Daylight Time, through Wednesday, October 25 at 12 midnight Eastern Daylight Time.","I will now turn the conference over to Jen Thompson of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.","Jen Thompson","Thank you, Melissa and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Andy Cecere, Terry Dolan and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's third quarter results and to answer your questions. Andy and Terry will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.","I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on Page 2 of today's presentation in our press release and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Andy.","Andy Cecere","Thanks Jen. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call. Terry and I will discuss third quarter results and provide you with some forward-looking guidance, after that, we'll take your questions.","I'll start in Slide 3 of the presentation. Third quarter net income totaled $1.6 billion or $0.88 per diluted share. Our performance was highlighted by record revenue in net income and earnings per share and our return on tangible common equity was 18%. Slide 4 highlights our key profitability metrics, each of which improved on both the linked quarter and year-over-year basis. The return on average assets for the third quarter was 1.38% and return on common equity was 13.6%. You can see on the far right of the chart that our efficiency ratio improved to 54.3%. On our second quarter earnings call, I told you that we will deliver positive operating leverage in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis and we did. ","Our revenue growth remained strong in the third quarter while our year-over-year expense growth dropped to 3.7% which is a significant improvement compared with the year-over-year growth rate we've experienced over the past several quarters. The above normal expense growth rate over that timeframe was primarily tied to expenses incurred to address the AML consent order. The people and processes needed to address these issues are substantially in place. And these costs have beginning to normalize towards the company's overall expense growth rate. We've reached in inflection point and we expect to deliver positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter and in 2018. ","I want to emphasize, however, that we'll continue to make prudent investment in our business to world that is changing at a faster pace never before. We are embracing the new reality of constant change and evolving customer behavior. Our ability to leverage technology and innovation to drive growth and improve efficiency will be fundamental component of our success. While the banking environment continues to evolve, our balance sheet is strong and growing. Credit quality is stable, we are winning market share in our businesses and we are delivering positive operating leverage.","In summary, we are well positioned heading into the end of the year and looking ahead to 2018. Terry will now provide some details on the quarter. ","Terry Dolan","Thank you, Andy. If you turn to Slide 5, I'll start with the balancing review and follow-up with the discussion of third quarter earnings trends. Average loans increased by 0.8% on a linked quarter basis and grew 3.0% from a year ago. Commercial loan grew 1.0% sequentially. While we continue to gain market share across our commercial lending businesses, some large corporate customers took advantage of a mid quarter decline in interest rate to secure low, long term funding. This preference for bond issuance benefited our capital market business and continues to impact total loan growth. The decline in commercial real estate loans reflects our prudent outlook for commercial real estate lending at this time and pay down activities as customers refinance to extend maturities at relatively low interest rate. ","Retail loan growth of 2.6% was supported by robust growth in installment loans and retail leasing. Strong growth in retail leasing reflects customer preference shifts toward lease financing as well as market share gains with dealers and manufactures. ","Turning to Slide 6, average total deposits increased 1.2% on a linked quarter basis and 5.2% year-over-year. We saw 0.9% decline in noninterest bearing deposits partly reflect the normal third quarter seasonality in our trust business, as well as investment managers deploying trust cash balances into other asset categories. Our total interest bearing deposit beta is similar to previous quarters and in line with our expectation. As future rate hikes occur, we would have expected the beta will gradually trend toward a 50% level. ","On Slide 7, you can see the credit quality was relatively stable in the quarter, net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans were 47 basis points in the third quarter and non-performing assets declined by 7.3% on a linked quarter basis. Our $360 million provision expense reflects normal provisioning related to loan growth, as well as potential credit losses for markets affected by the two recent hurricanes which occurred in the third quarter. After an assessment of credit exposures within the impacted areas, we do not expect any impact to the provision for credit losses in future quarters. ","I'll now move to earnings results. Slide 8 provides highlights of third quarter results versus comparable periods. Record third quarter net income of $1.6 billion was up 4.2% compared with the second quarter and up 4.1% versus the third quarter of 2016. Revenue totaled a record $5.6 billion, up 2.2% on a linked quarter basis and 4.1% higher compared with the same quarter a year ago. ","On Slide 9, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $3.2 billion in the third quarter, up 3.8% linked and 8.3% year-over-year. Comparisons in both quarters benefited from earning asset growth and higher interest rates. In the third quarter, the net interest margin increased six basis points to 3.10% slightly higher than our guidance. The third quarter margin benefited from higher than expected interest recoveries that contributed approximately two basis points on linked quarter basis. ","Slide 10 highlights trends in noninterest income which increased by 0.1% on a linked quarter basis and was down 0.9% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, credit and debit card revenue increased 3.0% on higher sales volumes. Credit and debit card revenue growth was muted somewhat by fewer processes and cycles in the third quarter of 2017, compared with a year ago and year-over-year impact of previously acquired portfolio.","Trust and asset management revenue grew 5.0% reflecting strong core business growth and favorable market conditions. Lower mortgage revenue primarily reflects a lower refinancing activity from a year ago. Merchant processing revenue was down 1.7% on year-over-year. As we previously discussed our recent exit of two joint ventures negatively affected the linked and year-over-year comparison. In addition, the recent hurricane conditions adversely impacted sales volume and related revenue in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of the weather conditions during the third quarter, merchant processing revenue was essentially flat from a year ago as expected. ","Turning to Slide 11, noninterest expense increase to 0.5% compared with the second quarter of 2017, and was up 3.7% versus the third quarter of 2016. On a year-over-year basis, higher personnel costs were partially offset by lower legal professional expenses and marketing expenses.","Slide 12 highlights our capital position. At September 30, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented was 9.4%. This compares to our capital target of 8.5%.","I will now provide some forward-looking guidance for the fourth quarter. We expect linked quarter total average loan to grow at pace similar to the third growth rate. We expect that net interest margin to be essentially flat to the third quarter which included two basis points related to unusually high interest recoveries for this period in the business cycle. With respect to fee revenue, the third quarter is seasonally our highest quarter for growth. We expect fee revenue to be essentially flat on a linked quarter basis and on a year-over-year basis. ","As Andy discussed, we will deliver positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter and in 2018, supported by expense growth in the 3% to 5% range. As a reminder, linked quarter expense growth in the fourth quarter is seasonally impacted by the timing of professional services and higher tax credit amortization expense. We expect credit quality to remain stable. ","I'll hand it back to Andy for closing comments. ","Andy Cecere","Thanks Terry. This company has a history that is remarkable for its consistent high performance. But we are always looking for ways to improve. This is the time to look ahead and I am very optimistic about the future .At its core banking is a relatively simple business. As with anything execution will be the differentiator. The winners in this industry would be those banks that anticipate customer preferences and deliver the product and services they demand in a most convenient and efficient manner. Towards that end, every single leader in this company is focused on two mandates. First, deliver on the promise of one US Bank by putting the customer at the center of every discussion and every decision regardless which door their customer walk through. Second, figure out how to optimize everything we do whether it's optimizing the customer experience, the distribution model or the customer relationship. Figure out the most efficient and most valued way to deliver the highest quality product and services and then do it. If we execute effectively, which I'm confident we'll, results not only the industry leading but improving returns. And we will deliver those results within the parameters of a risk management framework that considers both the current and future environment. ","I am looking forward to leading this company to the next phase of its evolution. Supported what I truly believe is the best team in the banking industry. That concludes our formal remarks. Terry, Bill and I will now be happy to answer your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Your first question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. ","Matt O'Connor","Good morning. I was wondering if you could just talk a bit about the deposit pricing strategy both on the interest bearing side and the noninterest deposits were down a little bit linked quarter on average basis, little bit more on a trade end basis. And just comments in terms of what type of migration that you are seeing out of the noninterest bearing into other buckets? ","Terry Dolan","Now so this is Terry, Matt. Let me talk a little bit about the deposit balances first. When you end up working at core deposit balances we really saw a little change relatively stable. Where the decreases did occur principally in a couple of different areas about $900 million it is really seasonal decreases that we always see for the second and the third quarter that's really tied to kind of our corporate trust business. Then we also saw some balances that went out simply because of custodial type of activities so those tend to be a little bit -- they fluctuate a little bit. Our time deposits were up a little and that was principally because of some decisions related to large customers. We expect that to be relatively short term and for those to flow out early in the fourth quarter. So but when you end up looking at the core deposit balances, they were reasonably stable during the quarter. The deposit pricing standpoint, let me just kind of talk about it, we haven't seen a lot of change relatively what we've been experienced in the past. We end up looking at retail deposit pricing or deposit beta they are essentially unchanged at this particular point in time and we don't see a lot of competitive pressure with respect to that. Our wholesale deposit pricing, we are essentially just being responsive to competitive pricing in the marketplace and that can be in certain markets a little bit on the West Coast and little bit in the New York area but not a lot of widespread competitive pressure that we are seeing. But those rates on the wholesale side are starting to go up. I'd also say if you end up looking at our corporate trust and deposits, those tend to be highly operational and fairly stable as well. So and keep that in mind too. ","Andy Cecere","And Terry you focused on average deposit being core relatively stable because any day period end could be very volatile given the trust. ","Terry Dolan ","Exactly, yes.","Operator","Your next question is from Scott Siefers from Sandler O'Neill & Partners. ","Scott Siefers ","Good morning, guys. Terry you had just sort of given the outlook for sort of flattish fees as you see them in the fourth quarter and then I guess year-over-year as well. Just as you see what are sort of the major nuisances in that guidance? In other words what are the puts and takes? And as you think about just the payments business in particular, appreciate the comment on both the JV exit and the hurricane activity but just how you are thinking about progression in those businesses? ","Terry Dolan ","Sure. Yes, when you end up looking at fee income it's typically seasonally flat to down in the fourth quarter. And that comes from a variety of different categories. Mortgage banking, from a market standpoint is a typically seasonally and little bit lower in the fourth quarter. Our payments businesses are typically a little seasonally down especially in the corporate payments space. So there are a number of kinds of categories that tend to be flat to down. Our commercial product revenue is typically flat to down a little bit as well because capital market activities tend to slow a little bit in the fourth quarter. So there are a number of different areas where you see that seasonal impact taking place. Let me tell you -- let me talk a little bit which is kind of your second question on the payments revenue. And you kind of keep in mind that we have really three businesses that are part to that. First is the credit card and debit card business and year-over-year the growth is about 3.0%. That was impacted by fewer processing days, and that's something that's unique to US bank because it's based upon how we best process those sales transaction in any one quarter and the third quarter happened to have one fewer processing cycle if you will. Sales on a reported basis, on a credit card perspective were up about 5.1%, without that processing cycle would have been about 6%. So that's pretty consistent with what we've seen in the past. That 3.0% is probably impacted by about one percentage point because of that processing day. When you think about the fourth quarter, we would have expected that credit card revenue to rebound a little bit because of that processing cycle that I talked about. And when we think about that particular business we can think about kind of mid single digit in terms of revenue growth on a year-over-year basis. Second category is really merchant acquiring and last quarter we talked about the fact that we exited the joint ventures. And we expected revenue to be essentially flat. And when we look at the impact of the joint ventures, that about 2% to 2.5% but the other thing that happened in the quarter as you know as we had three hurricanes and earthquake in Mexico and a variety of different things like that that end up impacting revenue growth by about 1.5%. As we think about fourth quarter, the impact of the hurricanes is going to continue. We still have a significant number of merchant that are either offline or have relatively slow sales as they continue to kind of come online. And so when we think about the fourth quarter we really think that merchant acquired revenue is probably going to be flat year-over-year. And then last business is our CPS business and we had a great quarter in CPS. If you end up looking at the total revenue within CPS it was up about 5% -- little over 5%, 5.8% on a year-over-year basis. Then you know we've been investing in a business pretty significantly, we talked about virtual pay in and some other things but we were investing in a couple of years ago. And we are starting to see some really nice dividend and momentum in that particular business. And when we look on a year-over-year basis we would expect to see continued growth and strength in that particular area but on a sequential basis or a linked quarter basis, it typically is a lower quarter in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. ","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow up on Scott's line of questioning. I completely appreciate that's probably too early to give outlook on the puts and takes behind the commitment deposit operating leverage for 2018. But I am wondering similarly how you walk through in the fourth quarter. Could you give us a sense of the big trend that you are seeing over the next 12 months that could drive fee growth next year? And I am wondering that because clearly you outlined the seasonality in the fourth quarter but also the fees are expected to be flat year-over-year. So just the big trend would be great. ","Terry Dolan ","Yes. At a very high level, again this is Terry. I think one of the biggest drags that we had this year was really related to mortgage banking revenue and so when we look into 2018, we see that has been relatively stable or starting to grow from there. And that was one of the biggest factors. And then within the merchant acquiring I think is probably the other major area that we'll continue to see strengthening in terms of the year-over-year growth rate because as those joint ventures kind of lapse in the second quarter of next year, some of the hurricane effects and some of the investments we've been making in that business, we should continue to see strength. Andy you want to add anything else here?","Andy Cecere","The only thing I would add to your question Erika is that on the expense side the equation as we mentioned in our prepared comments, I think we've reached an inflection point in terms of their higher growth rate that we've seen in the past. What you saw this quarter is more consistent with that 3% to 5% that we talked about. So balance sheet growth together with the income growth that Terry articulated and more normalized expense growth will give us that positive operating leverage. ","Erika Najarian","Thank you. And just a follow up to that. There has been a wide swing in terms of expectations for rate from just early in September to now. And I am wondering Andy you seemed very committed to the expense side of the efficiency ratio equation, if the revenue outlook for next year is not as robust as we think because of whatever the rate outlook is, is there enough flex in the expense base and that you could continue to make the investments that you referred to in prepared remarks but still deliver the positive operating leverage. ","Andy Cecere","So, Erika we are projecting what the market has in terms of rate increases both in December and then for next year. And that's set of assumptions that we are using to talk about and discuss positive operating leverage. To the extent that doesn't happen, we'll continue to manage expenses as best as we can like we always have and making sure we have the balance for the short-term result as well as the long-term investment in the businesses to make sure we can have growth going forward. So that's something we've always done and we'll continue to do.","Operator","Your next question is from John Pancari with Evercore.","John Pancari ","Good morning. On the loan growth side, I know you mentioned that the growth in the fourth quarter in average loan should be similar to that what you saw in the third quarter. So then about less than 1% so we are annualizing to about 4% or so. Is that a long, a fair assessment of where growth should really be trending even into 2018 and what could bring about strengthening outside of any -- as they are all macro factors that you need to see to really see pickup there in that growth rate. Thanks. ","Andy Cecere","John I'll start and then ask Bill to add some more color. So first of all it is lower than what we would expected over the long term and what we are seeing with our customers are couple of things. Number one is Terry mentioned taking advantage of lower yield curve and low rates, the lock in either to dead issuance and sometimes pay down bank lending activity is impacting us. So that's one. Second is much of the growth that we are seeing is M&A related and that I would call core CapEx and expansion. And I think that's a little bit of function of waiting for more clarity and certainty around principally tax policy and tax rates. And I think that will be a key driver of accelerated loan growth in 2018 when there is more clarity around tax policy. We also have some nuisances within category so let me ask Bill to talk about.","Bill Parker","Yes. The factor that Andy cited are macro factors right, low rate or the refinancing was certainly affects number of our C&I and commercial real estate. And then uncertainty holding back some of the natural activity, investment activity that our customers will make. So those are probably the two biggest drivers. That being said, we continued to be very aggressive in terms of our market share amongst prime customer base which is our customer base on across all the retail categories. So you could see we did grow our home equity loans that somewhat unique we never backed off from that. Credit cards, we've been growing those throughout the down turn in the cycle so we had steady growth in that. Auto loan, same thing, I mean we are in the super prime space there. Retail leasing, we never exited that, we stayed in that and we benefited from that lately. So we do have levers in the prime space that continues to give us loan growth regardless of what's going on a macro basis. ","Andy Cecere ","And I'd also mention that John our revolvers, utilization rate on a commercial revolvers are still right around 24% -25% that's about 10 points below what I would say is normal. So we are still growing commitment. We are taking market share but the utilization continues to be at low level. ","John Pancari ","All right. Thank you, Andy. And then separately on the credit side, I just want a little bit color on the consumer credit trends you are seeing, your card and auto charge offs and delinquency were up in a quarter and how much that is storm related versus not? Thanks. ","Bill Parker","Well, none of it is storm related now. That's too early for that. We did put in programs for reaching out to customers, providing loan application; we've already started that process. So that's well underway. But the reserve build that was mentioned that's really for what we expect to be kind of future credit losses as a result of the storm but that has not shown up. I think the increase that you are referring to in auto and cards, it's really just the seasoning effect, the fact that those portfolios have grown fairly significantly over the past several years. This is natural seasoning so they are performing within our expectations.","Andy Cecere","And again Bill they are -- they are prime portfolios, their average cycle on the leasing side 770 so nothing is going down stream in terms of that credit. ","John Pancari ","Got it. So nothing underlying in terms of deterioration starting -- okay, got it, thank you. ","Operator","Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning. I just wanted to dig a little bit on the comments you made in the presentation on the AML BSA. It sounds like it's coming to close in your compliance program are nearing maturity I think were the words you used. Could you just give us a sense as to is that going to accelerate over the next few quarters and so we should see pull back in the expense side there? ","Andy Cecere ","So as we've talked about before that the story and that has not changed. Betsy, the people processes and technology what we -- pretty much in place by the end of the year. They are almost on a place, we have a few more technology releases but that part of the spend, which is the bulk of it that will be in place by the end of the year. And then we'll see the compliance related expenses migrate more towards what I'd call a normal expense rate. I don't expect them to go down because we have to continue to maintain the levels we have but I'd expect them to normalize and that will normalize our overall expense growth rate back to that 3% to 5% like you saw this first quarter. With regard to the consent order overall, once those people processes and technology component have in place we go into a sustainability mode which is proving the back that they are working as intended and that will start beginning of 2018 and flow into what I would expect the middle of 2018.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then once you get the green light from regulators you passed the test, there is an opportunity to reengage in M&A. Could you just give us a sense as to how important that it is for you over the next kind of planning cycle here or is that one of the cores that you are looking into or is that just gravy or something comes up?","Andy Cecere","Betsy, our M&A activity hasn't really been impacted by this. There hasn't been traditional bank deal that we not been able to do that we wanted to do because of the consent order. Our M&A has been focused on categories like card portfolios, payments businesses as well as trust and fund services. Both that deals that we've been able to do, we continue to look at and I'd expect that our emphasis and focus going forward would continue to be on those deals. If after a consent order exit we see an opportunity on our traditional banking, yes, we will take a look at it but it have to be meeting our criteria which is increasing our market share in our current states having the core customer capabilities that we are looking for and so forth. But it's not causing a significant disadvantage today.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then just separately, the OCC changed their guidance on deposit advance product right, not allowed before now they are allowed again. Is that something that you would look at?","Andy Cecere","So Betsy we are looking at a number of different products in that category and that maybe something we pursue over the next few quarters over the next year. ","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then just lastly on the online lending, you have kicked off a couple of new relationships and product recently. Could you give us a sense partnership, could you give us a sense as to how these are progressing and what your expectations are from those relationships? ","Andy Cecere","Yes. So I think one that's doing very well is our mortgage partnership with Blend which is online application tool, mobile application tool which is doing terrifically. It is exceeding our expectations, it's very well in terms of highly thought of and functioning as expected both from the perspective of a customer but importantly also the mortgage originator. So it is a real positive because they are able to do some of the simple things in a more digital format and really add value to the customers in terms of consultation. So that has been very successful and we expect to continue to grow that into 2018.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, all right. And then just last on the deposit advanced product. That was like 2 percent-ish of your fee I think when you had to wind that business down. So is it your expectation at this stage that you could over time build that type of level of revenue back into your business model getting back into that type of space? ","Andy Cecere","Likely not, Betsy. If it comes back it would probably be at a different fee level and probably not with the same size as what we saw historically. And again there is not much certainty that it will come back right.","Operator","Your next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. ","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning, guys. I just wanted to come back to the NII side of equation and think about the balance sheet mix. So you are seeing as you mentioned all these ins and outs and out of flows and some might be temporary, some might be kind of this natural mixing and relate to the beta. But just wondering how did you think about just overall size of the balance sheet from here? I think we've seen a bit of slowing in AEA progression and given that loans are slower, how do you think that loans versus deposit growth is going to look for the fourth quarter and then beyond?","Andy Cecere","Yes. When we've talked a little bit about what we think loan growth is going to end up looking like in kind of what those categories are. Obviously from a balance sheet standpoint growth in loans is going to be really demand driven as much as anything. From a deposit perspective, I mean we are always looking for good core deposits and so when we have the opportunity to grow good core deposits they are going to be long term stable, we will take that opportunity to be able to do that. But I think what you are going to see really from here for a period of time is just some fluctuation with respect to deposit balances. ","Ken Usdin","Okay. And will that mean will you be willing to -- the cost of your short term borrowing has actually started to increase a lot too. I would assume that's more market based type of funding. And so does that mean that we see a mix more towards that wholesale if there is more fluctuations in deposits and how that is kind of weigh on the forward outlook for the margin past the fourth quarter. ","Andy Cecere ","Yes. I don't think that you are going to see a significant shift in how we end up funding the balance sheet. I mean what ends up happening from a short term standpoint is just what sort of cash level needs, you need in order to have in place in order to meet liquidity requirement either on an average basis or the end of the month and so that's probably what you are seeing more than anything. ","Operator","Your next question is from Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez","Hi, good morning. I have couple of questions on taxes. Any updated thoughts on your expectations for your tax rate assuming no changes in quarter in terms of corporate tax rate? And I think last quarter you said FTA adjusted 29%. And secondly on tax reform I think in the past you guys have indicated you feel like you can get something along the lines of 60% of the benefit. Obviously the devil is going to be in the details and there is lack of detail out there. But the blueprint did specifically seem to protect low income housing credit. So curious if there is any updated thoughts in terms of how you see yourself benefiting from tax reform and how much of that you feel like you can garner from any reduction in the corporate tax rate? ","Andy Cecere ","Yes. Well, so I'll take the first question which is really how we think about the fourth quarter. I think the tax rate in the fourth quarter would be pretty similar to what the third quarter was. So that's kind of our expectation. In terms of tax reform, I don't think our view has really changed in terms of what the impact of that might be on the company kind of going forward. But to be quite honest, we were in Washington here recently and what's going to ultimately be in the tax reform bill, there are still moving around a lot even though that there are some framework associated with it. So we are kind of in a wait and see mode in all honesty. ","Bill Parker","About 29% in the fourth quarter. ","Andy Cecere ","29% in the fourth quarter. ","Saul Martinez","Got it, that's fair. And then just finally on Elavon? Was there any FX impact? I didn't see that in the release. ","Andy Cecere ","Yes. The impact of FX was very insignificant in the third quarter.","Operator","Your next question is from Brian Foran with Autonomous.","Brian Foran","Hi, good morning. Just think about the payment business longer term. And I assume merchant processing is the biggest piece of that but really all four line items that we see on the face of the P&L. There has been department of percent issue, there was some FX headwinds, now there is the JVs so I appreciate there has been lots of puts and takes but what do you think it take kind of takes for those line items to show little bit more momentum and get back to the normal more significant growth rate that maybe they enjoyed in the past.","Andy Cecere ","Yes. Well, I think that maybe when you end up looking at the merchant acquiring business, we think on a longer term basis as kind of a mid single digits are a little bit stronger than that. One other things we are seeing or seen stronger sales volumes in their business and I think what we've to do is we have to get beyond the impact of the joint venture as well, some of the hurricane effect. And from a hurricane standpoint as an example, we've now -- we face four hurricanes and earthquake and some wildfire so I think there is a few things that we are going to end up having kind of work through over the next quarter or two. The hurricane effect in Puerto Rico where we have a fairly significant amount of merchants who is going to be there for several quarters. So I really look at it in terms of timing probably mid next year before we get back to that normalized sort of growth level because we'll lap those joint ventures. And I'd also add Brian and we talk about investment and innovation, this is an area we've been focused on historically and we continued to be going forward. I remind you we have a couple of great platforms, our international platform, our dynamic currency conversation capabilities because we invest in the business and merchant processes an area we continue to focused on particularly as it relates to e-commerce and value added services principally around data so it will continue to be an emphasis and an area of focus for us in terms of investment and capabilities.","Brian Foran","And then maybe just turn into the auto leasing business. Totally appreciate your comments that are all prime and partly driven by customer preferences. But maybe you could just talk about -- I mean the growth rates have been very high. One, are there specific strategy that are in place to gain more shares with dealers or geographic expansion or anything like that? And then two, you gave some helpful commentary, I believe it was back in April kind of citing some of the green shoots in used car pricing so as you roll forward today, are you still seeing the kind of stabilization and even recovery in used car pricing? And is this growth you are pursuing in auto leasing kind of you are saying that you think the market is overdone and how does it feed into the overall used car price outlook?","Bill Parker","So this is Bill. No, we are still bullish on our retail leasing portfolio. So it has been a good business or remains a good business. Used car prices have actually picked up even more in part because of the hurricane that increased demand for pickup et cetera. So in terms of expansion, we do go after different manufactures and we are very competitive in that space, provide an alternative to some of the old captives. So it's an area that we continue to work very hard to keep the growth rates up. ","Operator","Your next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. ","Mike Mayo","Hi. You mentioned commercial real estate a little bit more caution, it's big chunk of loans at your company. So I guess is commercial real estate a friend or foe on the one hand or maybe you can make a case for home prices back above pre crisis levels and homebuilders or some others could do well. On the other hand you have retailers and a more competitive environment. Where do you come out on that?","Bill Parker","So commercial real estate is a friend. We are -- I think we've always been in active in that space. We did not cut back or exit our construction lending after the downturn, that's grown nicely. We've continued -- we are very active in this space but with the low rates and lot of our customers are appropriately seeking long term fixed rate for financing something banks are not great at offering. There are better sources for that in insurance company, some of the smaller banks, CMBS market but we are -- we remain very active with our client base. Some of our client base is gotten a little more cautious as well. Lot of the growth has been in multifamily, so people are little more cautious in that space, that's just for our client. Residential mortgage, construction we have been very active in that. And we never pulled out of that, they extended into Texas, and we had really nice growth in the Texas market. That's obviously going to be little disruptive by what happened with the hurricanes but that will come back. So overall we are very active commercial real estate lender and we like the business. ","Mike Mayo","So just one follow up. So one -- if you look at over the past couple of decades where are we in terms of being aggressive being conservative. When you look at your own experience, is this, 2010 is great and 5 is average and 1 is look out that's 1992, where do you think we are in the CRE cycle? ","Bill Parker","I don't really think of it that way because we stick with our underwriting criteria so we are consistent throughout the cycle. And different asset classes or a different spaces you mentioned kind of concerns with the retails. Well, that's been good for the industrial side. So we've seen nice growth in industrial activity. So there is balance of activity that we provide our customer base and its ebbs and flows, but it's a business we stick with. ","Operator","Your next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. Good morning. When you look at your owned portfolio, residential mortgage is now the second largest category and it's continuing to grow. When you look at the mortgage banking business, I am kind of looking at it in the sense there has been a shift from originate and sell and to originate and portfolio of loans because we just don't enough total loan growth in the market. So we are not squeezing out those loans like we used to. Is that a rational way to think about it? And if so is mortgage banking which is kind of business that you kind of continue to grow is going to pretty more fee income from that maybe just not going to get back on track from a fee income side but we have a heavier kind of contribution in net interest income. ","Andy Cecere ","Marty, I'd say it's balanced and we both originate a sell which are the qualified market just that we've always done and that continuous to be area for growth for us as well as the servicing component. And we portfolio those which are not typically jumbos in our core customer base. So I would expect growth in both categories and I wouldn't expect the major shift one way or the other. Bill, would you add anything to that? ","Bill Parker","No. I mean the portfolio activities that are a national platform along with qualified mortgages so we originate through retail channels and through from broker so we will continue to see portfolio growth in the jumbo category. And if you can look at the stack, extremely high quality and low loan to value so --.","Marty Mosby","Bill I think I was going to ask you about was seemed to be two things that kind of took a little bit of the earnings out this quarter in the $30 million build with net charge -offs going down and non-performers going down, you kind of handed that was hurricane related but want to make sure that because that's not what you have been doing in the past. So that big portion of that was related to hurricane and the expected losses going forward and then also the tax rate, the 29% this quarter and then foreshadowing that to next quarter, that's about 0.5% higher than what you have been. So just I was curious why the step up in the tax rate and the build and allowance for those two things. ","Bill Parker","Yes, this is Bill. I'll do the build and allowance, that was entirely related to the hurricanes. We had some modest -- we've been doing some very modest build related to loan growth. We will continue to do that but the loan bump up was definitely directly related to the hurricane. ","Andy Cecere ","And our expectations that is -- ","Bill Parker","That is sufficient to cover ","Andy Cecere ","Sufficient and including what we know thus far in the wildfire situation in California. ","Terry Dolan ","And the tax rate, really the issue there is that again kind of comes back to tax reforms and some of the uncertainty there. When you had a lot of conversations around tax credit low income, renewal energy and all sorts of things. There is a lot of pull back within the market and lot of change in related to pricing associated with tax credit. So part of the reasons why you are seeing the rate going up is a little bit lower level of tax credit production which is market driven as much as anything and then as earnings get stronger you had just have the marginal effect on the tax rate and that will cause it to go up as well.","Operator","And your next question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin Barker","Hi, good morning. In regards to your credit, obviously it's been very good over last several years and running well below your long term target and what you think the normalized charges- off would be. And we start to see somewhat of an inflection point here in credit card losses moving higher after several years of being strong or even better than what we've seen in past cycles. When we look over into 2018 and maybe even to 2019, what are your expectations for where credit card losses are going and where charge -offs may actually end up given we are still at pretty good part of the cycle. ","Bill Parker","So they have gone up due to seasoning, due to sort of natural seasoning and growing the portfolio. But we do expect them to stabilize around the 4% rate that would be sort of normal -- that's not through the cycle rate but that's sort of normal rate during stable economic conditions. ","Andy Cecere","Current environment 4%.","Bill Parker","Yes.","Kevin Barker","And when you think about the outlook is it something where it grows to 4% in plateaus or is it something where you would incrementally continue to see move higher?","Bill Parker","No. We will think it will plateau around the 4% in this kind of economic condition. ","Kevin Barker","Okay. And then given the outlook on auto, we've obviously seen pressure on used car prices in here and to follow up on some of the John's questions, delinquency rates and frequency of the fall to start to slow across the industry, do you expect charge-offs rates decline in 2018 given some of the positive development we've seen with a little bit resiliency in used car prices and slight decline in frequency?","Bill Parker","I would say -- I wouldn't necessary say decline but I think they are pretty stable right now. So I would say about where they are right now. ","Operator","Your next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning. Hi, Andy, how are you? Terry, if I heard you correctly on the earlier part of the call talking about the net interest margin, I think you said you had some maybe couple of basis points improvement due to the recoveries on some bad credits. Could you make sure that's correct that it was a basis point or two? And was that in the energy sector that you had to recover in the credits?","Terry Dolan ","Yes. So it was two basis points impact from interest recoveries that occurred in this quarter and actually these recoveries relate to loans that were probably charged up as many as 10 years ago. So they went back long ways which is in part why they were so unexpected and unusual. And it's not something that we would expect to repeat. But it was about two basis points for the quarter. So you think we went up six basis points and our core basis of this four and we are really expecting the core basis go up another two in the fourth quarter from there. But it will be flat because of the interest recoveries. ","Gerard Cassidy","Good. Okay and thank you for the clarity. And then second, you guys talked about how the betas for the traditional consumer deposits really are not that high, but you did see some in the commercial area. What about within the Wealth Management segment? Some of the other banks that have reported have pointed out that the betas are rising and that part of their business. Did you guys see any of that in the Wealth Management business?","Terry Dolan ","Yes. In the wealth management business we've not seen that yet although when we end up looking at the broader consumer sort of category that's the one area that we may start to see when we get into the next rate hike. But we haven't seen anything at this point.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay, good. And then with rising rates, obviously, some of your commercial customers will pay for the services you guys give them with compensating balances, and the credit they receive is reflective of the rate environment. Are you starting to raise those credits for them in a rising rate environment or not yet?","Terry Dolan ","Yes. A little bit relative to what's going on with short term rate as well as the yield curve overall but I don't -- it's not material yet and we would expect to continue raise and as rates move up. ","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. And does that show up in the treasury management fee line? I noticed it was down little bit sequentially. I don't know if that was more seasonal or not. But is that the way where we would see that?","Terry Dolan ","Yes. Compensating balances show up there and the credit for compensating balances as you said but the decline was more seasonal in nature. ","Operator","Next question is from Terry McEvoy with Stephens.","Terry McEvoy","Hi, good morning. It was mentioned earlier that US bank is gaining share in the commercial lending business and it sounds like that will likely continue here in the fourth quarter. Could you expand on specifically what's behind those gains? Is it some targeted industries or some specific markets that standout? ","Terry Dolan ","Yes. This is Terry. Just kind of broadly we are seeing good growth in market share and loans in the middle market space across most of our markets. And we would continue to kind of expect to see although I would say recently we've seen some pay down occurring even in the middle market space so it's something that we are watching. ","Bill Parker","Yes. It really relates to the old products that we build out over the last several years in our national corporate strategy. So I think the capabilities in the capital market area for providing bond underwriting not only for our investment grade but also kind of middle market or non investment grade customers. So they can come to us and a more full service bank and that's providing a lot of fuel to the growth. ","Andy Cecere","And currently to that point Bill, the other area that I have to highlight is the virtual pay product which is corporate payment system product which is targeted squarely at that middle market customer base as well above that but that one is one of the drivers of the growth that we are seeing is taking additional customers and using that product. ","Terry McEvoy","That's good to hear. And then Terry just a quick question for you, within the corporate lines or these equity investment gains that were up $46 million, I believe year-over-year, could you just talk about the nature of those gains and what type of typical run rate would you see in any given quarter?","Terry Dolan ","Yes. We typically don't get into a lot of detail with respect to other incomes simply because there is a lot of different things and including the equity investments. Equity investments tend to be a little bit choppy from quarter-to-quarter so it's really I kind of stay away from giving guidance with respect to what I think they're going to be next quarter et cetera. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to the presenters for closing remarks. ","Jen Thompson","Thank you for listening to our call this morning. Please call us if you have any follow up comments or questions. ","Andy Cecere","Thanks everyone. ","Terry Dolan ","Thank you.
